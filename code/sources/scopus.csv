Owing to the evolving landscape of this research and the complexity of biological processes, however, this task presents challenges. We introduce PATHAK, a natural language processing (NLP)-based method that mines relationships between genes and their functions from published scientific articles. PATHAK utilizes a pre-trained Transformer language model to generate sentence embeddings from a vast dataset of scientific documents. This enables the identification of meaningful associations between genes and their potential functional annotations. Our approach is adaptable and applicable across diverse scientific domains. Applying PATHAK to over 17,000 research articles focused on Arabidopsis thaliana, we assigned approximately 1493 GO terms to 10,976 genes by analyzing article sentences, comparing their embeddings to GO term embeddings, and mapping potential matches. The model demonstrates moderate-to-high predictive accuracy, capturing ~ 57% overlap of GO terms (6258 out of 10,976) between predicted and known annotations on TAIR, including 1271 and 161 exact matches and 4826 partially related terms. This method promises to significantly advance our understanding of gene functionality and potentially accelerate discoveries in the context of plant development, growth and stress responses in plants and other systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Function; Gene Ontology; Nlp; Published Articles; Arabidopsis Thaliana; Article; Gene; Gene Function; Gene Ontology; Human; Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Physiological Stress; Plant Development; Arabidopsis; Bioinformatics; Data Mining; Genetics; Molecular Genetics; Procedures; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Natural Language Processing","Arabidopsis thaliana; article; gene; gene function; gene ontology; human; language model; natural language processing; physiological stress; plant development; Arabidopsis; bioinformatics; data mining; genetics; molecular genetics; procedures; Computational Biology; Data Mining; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Natural Language Processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000066172"

Text reports are a critical part of such analyses. Cardiac ultrasound reports include structured and free text and vary across institutions, hampering attempts to mine text for useful insights. Natural language processing (NLP) can help and includes both statistical- and large language model based techniques. We tested whether we could use NLP to map cardiac ultrasound text to a three-level hierarchical ontology. We used statistical machine learning (EchoMap) and zero-shot inference using GPT. We tested eight datasets from 24 different institutions and compared both methods against clinician-scored ground truth. Despite all adhering to clinical guidelines, institutions differed in their structured reporting. EchoMap performed best with validation accuracy of 98% for the first ontology level, 93% for first and second levels, and 79% for all three. EchoMap retained performance across external test datasets and could extrapolate to examples not included in training. EchoMap’s accuracy was comparable to zero-shot GPT at the first level of the ontology and outperformed GPT at second and third levels. We show that statistical machine learning can map text to structured ontology and may be especially useful for small, specialized text datasets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Echocardiography Report; Large Language Models; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Ontology; Echocardiography; Human; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Procedures; Echocardiography; Humans; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing","echocardiography; human; machine learning; natural language processing; procedures; Echocardiography; Humans; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218835532"

Effector predictors utilizing pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) have shown sound performance by leveraging extensive evolutionary and sequential protein features. However, the accuracy and sensitivity of effector prediction remain challenging. Here, we introduce a model named Contrastive-learning of Language Embedding and Biological Features (CLEF) leveraging contrastive learning to integrate PLM representations with supplementary biological features. Biologically information is captured in learned contextualized embeddings to yield meaningful representations. With cross-modality biological features, CLEF outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in predicting type III, type IV, and type VI secreted effectors (T3SEs/T4SEs/T6SEs) in enteric pathogens. All experimentally verified effectors in Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli and 41 of 43 experimentally verified T3SEs of Salmonella Typhimurium are recognized. Moreover, 12 predicted T3SEs and 11 predicted T6SEs are validated by extensive experiments in Edwardsiella piscicida. Furthermore, integrating omics data via CLEF framework enhances protein representations to illustrate effector-effector interactions and determine in vivo colonization-essential genes. Collectively, CLEF provides a blueprint to bridge the gap between in silico PLM’s capacity and experimental biological information to fulfill complicated tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adenylate Cyclase; Bacterial Proteins; Virulence Factors; Adenylate Cyclase; Bacterial Protein; Transcriptome; Translation Termination Factor; Virulence Factor; Bacterium; Biological Processes; Gene Expression; Host-pathogen Interaction; Microbial Activity; Microbiology; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Autoencoder; Bacterial Secretion System; Bacterial Virulence; Comparative Study; Contrastive Learning; Controlled Study; Cross Validation; Deep Learning; Edwardsiella; Edwardsiella Piscicida; Effector Prediction; Embedding; Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia Coli; Enteropathogen; Few Shot Learning; Five Fold Cross Validation; Gene Ontology; Immunoblotting; Learning Algorithm; Multilayer Perceptron; Nonhuman; Predictive Model; Protein Interaction; Protein Language Model; Protein Secretion; Protein Structure; Salmonella Enterica Serovar Typhimurium; Supernatant; Transposon; Type Iii Secretion System; Type Vi Secretion System; Western Blotting; Bioinformatics; Genetics; Gram Negative Bacterium; Machine Learning; Metabolism; Pathogenicity; Procedures; Virulence; Bacterial Proteins; Computational Biology; Gram-negative Bacteria; Machine Learning; Salmonella Typhimurium; Virulence; Virulence Factors","adenylate cyclase; bacterial protein; transcriptome; translation termination factor; virulence factor; bacterium; biological processes; gene expression; host-pathogen interaction; microbial activity; microbiology; protein; amino acid sequence; Article; autoencoder; bacterial secretion system; bacterial virulence; comparative study; contrastive learning; controlled study; cross validation; deep learning; Edwardsiella; Edwardsiella piscicida; effector prediction; embedding; enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli; enteropathogen; few shot learning; five fold cross validation; gene ontology; immunoblotting; learning algorithm; multilayer perceptron; nonhuman; predictive model; protein interaction; protein language model; protein secretion; protein structure; Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium; supernatant; transposon; type III secretion system; type VI secretion system; Western blotting; bioinformatics; genetics; Gram negative bacterium; machine learning; metabolism; pathogenicity; procedures; virulence; Bacterial Proteins; Computational Biology; Gram-Negative Bacteria; Machine Learning; Salmonella typhimurium; Virulence; Virulence Factors","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217875320"

Existing approaches are subjective and fail to take information from protein sequences into consideration. Deep learning can automatically learn features from protein sequences and protein–protein interactions for hierarchical clustering. Results: Using a large amount of publicly available proteomics data, we created a hierarchical tree for breast cancer protein communities using a novel hierarchical graph neural network, with the supervision of gene ontology terms and assistance of a pre-trained deep contextual language model. Then, a group-lasso algorithm was applied to identify protein communities that are under both mutation burden and survival burden, undergo significant alterations when targeted by specific drug molecules, and show cancer-dependent perturbations. The resulting hierarchical map of protein communities shows how gene-level mutations and survival information converge on protein communities at different scales. Internal validity of the model was established through the convergence on BRCA2 as a breast cancer hotspot. Further overlaps with breast cancer cell dependencies revealed SUPT6H and RAD21, along with their respective protein systems, HOST:37 and HOST:861, as potential biomarkers. Using gene-level perturbation data of the HOST:37 and HOST:861 gene sets, three FDA-approved drugs with high therapeutic value were selected as potential treatments to be further evaluated. These drugs include mercaptopurine, pioglitazone, and colchicine. Conclusion: The proposed graph neural network approach to analyzing breast cancer protein communities in a hierarchical structure provides a novel perspective on breast cancer prognosis and treatment. By targeting entire gene sets, we were able to evaluate the prognostic and therapeutic value of genes (or gene sets) at different levels, from gene-level to system-level biology. Cancer-specific gene dependencies provide additional context for pinpointing cancer-related systems and drug-induced alterations can highlight potential therapeutic targets. These identified protein communities, in conjunction with other protein communities under strong mutation and survival burdens, can potentially be used as clinical biomarkers for breast cancer. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomarker; Breast Cancer; Graph Neural Network; Group Lasso; Hierarchical Clustering; Protein Communities; Biomarkers, Tumor; Neoplasm Proteins; Hierarchical Clustering; Breast Cancer; Gene Levels; Gene Sets; Graph Neural Networks; Group Lasso; Hier-archical Clustering; Hierarchical Clustering; Hierarchical Structures; Protein Community; Protein Sequences; Lung Cancer; Tumor Marker; Tumor Protein; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Breast Tumor; Female; Genetics; Human; Metabolism; Mutation; Procedures; Protein Protein Interaction; Proteomics; Algorithms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Neural Networks, Computer; Protein Interaction Maps; Proteomics","Hierarchical clustering; Breast Cancer; Gene levels; Gene sets; Graph neural networks; Group LASSO; Hier-archical clustering; Hierarchical Clustering; Hierarchical structures; Protein community; Protein sequences; Lung cancer; tumor marker; tumor protein; algorithm; artificial neural network; breast tumor; female; genetics; human; metabolism; mutation; procedures; protein protein interaction; proteomics; Algorithms; Biomarkers, Tumor; Breast Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Mutation; Neoplasm Proteins; Neural Networks, Computer; Protein Interaction Maps; Proteomics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216588998"

One key challenge is the abundance of domain-specific terminology, which an LLM is not trained to extract in accordance with the underlying physical laws. Such black-box models can also lead to unreliable results or hallucinations. Hybrid AI, which combines data-driven and symbolic methods, leverages domain knowledge to add explainability and reliability to answers. Our group has previously developed a domain-informed ontology-based information extraction tool called SUSIE, which extracts key terms and their context to present them to the user as knowledge graphs (KGs). Although KGs are used to visualize relationships between different entities, they are not easily accessible for user questions. However, they serve as a structured input for LLMs. Thus, KGs can efficiently query a corpus of pharmaceutical documents, streamlining drug discovery and manufacturing processes. In this work, we propose methods to improve the information extraction capabilities of SUSIE by expanding its knowledge base and improving its ability to understand scientific material through a sentence-restructuring module. Additionally, we present a customized question-and-answer module that enables the user to query from generated KGs and get an answer in natural language. Unlike black-box models such as those purely powered by OpenAI's models and the LangChain GraphQA packages, combining our KGs with Neo4j limits hallucinations and provides reliable and traceable answers in a user-friendly chatbot interface. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid Ai; Knowledge Graph; Llms; Neo4j; Ontology; Pharmaceutical Engineering; Chatbots; Data Mining; Domain Knowledge; Drug Discovery; Drug Products; Extraction; Graphic Methods; Information Retrieval; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Query Processing; Black Box Modelling; Graph-based; Hybrid Ai; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Neo4j; Ontology's; Pharmaceutical Engineering; Ontology","Chatbots; Data mining; Domain Knowledge; Drug discovery; Drug products; Extraction; Graphic methods; Information retrieval; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Query processing; Black box modelling; Graph-based; Hybrid AI; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Neo4j; Ontology's; Pharmaceutical engineering; Ontology","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013583716"

Rule-based HPO extraction tools use concept recognition to automatically identify phenotypes, but they often struggle with incomplete phenotype assignment, requiring significant manual review. While large language models (LLMs) hold promise for more context-driven phenotype extraction, they are prone to errors and “hallucinations,” making them less reliable without further refinement. We present RAG-HPO, a Python-based tool that leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to elevate accuracy of HPO term assignment by LLM. This approach bypasses the limitations of baseline models and eliminates the need for time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning. RAG-HPO integrates a dynamic vector database, containing > 54,000 phenotypic phrases mapped to HPO IDs, which allows real-time retrieval and contextual matching. The RAG-HPO workflow begins by extracting phenotypic phrases from clinical text via an LLM and then matching them via semantic similarity to entries within the database. The best term matches are returned to the LLM as context for final HPO term assignment of each phrase. Results: Performance was benchmarked on 112 published case reports with 1792 manually assigned HPO terms and compared to Doc2HPO, ClinPhen, and FastHPOCR. In evaluations, RAG-HPO + LLaMa-3.1 70B achieved a mean precision of 0.81, recall of 0.76, and an F1 score of 0.78—significantly surpassing conventional tools (p < 0.00001). RAG-HPO returned 1648 terms, of which 19.1% (315) were false positives that did not exactly match our manually annotated standard. Among these, < 1% (1/315) represented hallucinations, and 1.3% (4/315) represented terms with no ontological relationship to the desired target; the remaining false positives (95.2%, 300/315) were broader ancestor terms of the target term, which may still be relevant to users in many contexts. Conclusions: RAG-HPO is a user-friendly, adaptable tool designed for secure evaluation of clinical text and outperforms standard HPO-matching tools in precision, recall, and F1. Its enhanced precision and recall represent a substantial advancement in phenotypic analysis, accelerating the identification of genetic mechanisms underlying rare diseases and driving progress in genetic research and clinical genomics.

Evidence triangulation across diverse study designs is essential for balancing biases and establishing causality, but scalable, automated methods for achieving this are lacking. In this study, we assess the performance of large language models in extracting both ontological and methodological information from scientific literature to automate evidence triangulation. A two-step extraction approach—focusing on exposure-outcome concepts first, followed by relation extraction—outperforms a one-step method, particularly in identifying the direction of effect (F1 = 0.86) and statistical significance (F1 = 0.96). Using salt intake and blood pressure as a case study, we calculate the Convergency of Evidence and Level of Convergency, finding a strong excitatory effect of salt on blood pressure (942 studies), and weak excitatory effect on cardiovascular diseases and deaths (124 studies).

In this circumstance, developing useful tool for achieving efficient literature management is of high value. Traditional literature management tools, such as tools for key word searching, paper recommendation, relation visualization, and keyword cloud drawing, are not suitable for conducting content-level literature review. To address the issues of traditional literature management tools, a novel problem and method-oriented fine-grained academic graph is proposed to facilitate the exploration of research questions, methodologies, study perspectives, and their connections hidden in massive literature. For building such graph, a new ontology dedicated for describing the features of research paper is developed, an innovative multi-relation join extraction model is proposed, and a creative approach for leveraging the Large Language Models (LLM) to augment the triplet extraction results generated by supervised-learning model is developed. Experiments on widely used benchmark datasets show that the proposed multi-relation extraction model is able to achieve at least 8.01% and 8.65% improvement on entity identification and relation classification respectively, compared with state-of-the-art models.

However, the adoption of machine learning (ML) models in this context is frequently limited by their lack of interpretability, particularly among non-expert users such as farmers. This study proposes a novel approach to soil moisture prediction that combines high predictive performance with enhanced explainability. We propose a framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate textual explanations based on a proposed irrigation and soil moisture ontology, thus making the model's predictions more understandable to farmers. The ontology formalizes essential agricultural concepts and their interrelationships, enabling semantically rich explanations to bridge the gap between sophisticated model results and practical decision-making. Our approach is exemplified by a prototype system that provides both predictions and user-friendly explanations. The findings highlight the potential of combining advanced ML techniques with semantic reasoning to improve the interpretability and adoption of Artificial Intelligence in agriculture. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Llm; Machine Learning; Ontology; Soil Moisture; Xai","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011092015"

Transforming this data into RDF-encoded knowledge graphs enhances interoperability and enables advanced querying capabilities. However, existing methods like R2RML and Direct Mapping face significant challenges, including the need for domain expertise and scalability issues. LLMs, with their advanced natural language processing capabilities, offer a promising solution by automating the conversion process, reducing the reliance on expert knowledge, and semantically enriching data through appropriate ontologies.

Knowledge reorganization strategies were proposed for key application scenarios and validated through case visualizations. A conceptual model for biographical texts was constructed. Significant enhancement of tag corpora was achieved through LLMs and the RoBERTa-BiLSTM-CRF model, achieving optimal fine-tuning in NER.

Is this merely a technical problem—or a philosophical one? If ever-better “answers” in AGI are not absolute endpoints, what are they? One way to understand “answers” is as recombinations within lived interpretation—temporary syntheses that organize experience into coherent conceptual structures. This article posits that no philosophical “answer” is a terminal truth; it is an integration of conceptual form that stabilizes meaning in the face of ambiguity. Creativity, exploration, and the very act of questioning—rather than the pursuit of definitive answers—may be the true engines of both philosophical insight and human-like intelligence. Here, we argue that genuine understanding emerges through continuous inquiry and recursive reorganization. Answers, in this view, remain provisional constructions, shaped by dissonance and forever open to revision. To ground this thesis, we embed multiple traditions as epistemic momentum vectors. Phenomenological ambiguity, ontological instability, hermeneutic dissonance, pragmatic friction, and erotetic incompleteness each introduce distinct tensions that propel the Q-Centric architecture toward recursive questioning. Their divergence is not noise, but the generative condition of meaning-making. By integrating these layered vectors, we sketch a pathway to AGI systems that do more than respond coherently; they orient themselves toward what remains unresolved. Reconceptualizing “answers” as momentary crystallizations of tension, the Q-Centric model offers a philosophical foundation for building reflective, adaptive machines that question—rather than merely conclude. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agi; Consciousness; Embodied Intelligence; Epistemic Architecture; Intelligent Systems Design; Question-centric Cognition; Cognitive Systems; Computer Architecture; Intelligent Systems; Iodine Compounds; Ontology; Philosophical Aspects; Agi; Conceptual Structures; Consciousness; Embodied Intelligence; Epistemic Architecture; Human Like; Human-like Intelligence; Intelligent System Design; Question-centric Cognition; Self Awareness; Systems Analysis","Cognitive systems; Computer architecture; Intelligent systems; Iodine compounds; Ontology; Philosophical aspects; AGI; Conceptual structures; Consciousness; Embodied intelligence; Epistemic architecture; Human like; Human-like intelligence; Intelligent system design; Question-centric cognition; Self awareness; Systems analysis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010560488"

This paper presents a multi-agent organizational framework in which human agents, LLMs, and specialized agents (narrow AIs) collaborate via dynamic, topic-based group formation. Topic-driven interactions enable agents to coalesce around evolving interests, supported by threshold-based protocols for temporal adaptation, topic emergence, and participation. Methods: Within our framework, human agents guide the overall system objectives, while consultant agents (LLMs) provide semantic analysis and mediation, and specialized agents perform focused domain tasks. By leveraging automated topic modeling, the approach eschews rigid ontologies and instead supports adaptive and interpretable content management. Mathematical properties ensure system coherence—across roles, tasks, and timescales—while allowing the natural evolution of interests and groups. Results: We illustrate the framework’s versatility with example scenarios in emergency response, healthcare research, and financial decision-making, emphasizing how human decision-makers, LLM-based consultants, and specialized worker agents jointly fulfill complex goals through transparent topic alignment and threshold-driven coordination.

Methods: This study was conducted on the human phenotype ontology (HPO), which is used in medical research and diagnosis. Medical experts assess the performance of both models on a set of 120 translated HPO terms and their 180 synonyms, employing a 4-point Likert scale (strongly agree = 1, agree = 2, disagree = 3, strongly disagree = 4). An independent reference translation from the HeTOP database was used to validate the quality of the translation. Results: The average Likert rating for the selected HPO terms was 1.29 for GPT-3.5 and 1.37 for DeepL. The quality of the translations was also found to be satisfactory for multi-word terms with greater ontological depth. The comparison with HeTOP revealed a high degree of similarity between the models’ translations and the reference translations. Conclusions: Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences in the mean ratings between the two models, indicating their comparable performance in terms of translation quality. The study not only illustrates the potential of machine translation but also shows incomplete coverage of translated medical terminology.

We show that CPP deciphers a γ-secretase substrate signature with single-residue resolution, which can explain the conformational transitions observed in substrates upon γ-secretase binding. Using machine learning, we predict the entire human γ-secretase substrate scope, revealing numerous previously unknown substrates. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art protein language models, improving prediction accuracy from 60% to 90%, and achieves an 88% success rate in experimental validation. Building on these advancements, we identify pathways and diseases not linked before to γ-secretase. Generally, CPP decodes physicochemical signatures—a concept that extends beyond sequence motifs.

Additionally, they lack the ability to generate patient-centered clinical insights or recommend further symptoms for differential diagnosis. Methods: We developed PhenoDP, a deep learning-based toolkit with three modules: Summarizer, Ranker, and Recommender. The Summarizer fine-tuned a distilled large language model to create clinical summaries from a patient’s Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. The Ranker prioritizes diseases by combining information content-based, phi-based, and semantic-based similarity measures. The Recommender employs contrastive learning to recommend additional HPO terms for enhanced diagnostic accuracy. Results: PhenoDP’s Summarizer produces more clinically coherent and patient-centered summaries than the general-purpose language model FlanT5. The Ranker achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance, consistently outperforming existing phenotype-based methods across both simulated and real-world datasets. The Recommender also outperformed GPT-4o and PhenoTips in improving diagnostic accuracy when its suggested terms were incorporated into different ranking pipelines.

This is especially important in materials science, which is adversely affected by data scarcity. Data scarcity further motivates employing solutions such as foundation language models for extracting information which can in principle address several subtasks of the information extraction problem in a range of domains without the need of generating costly large-scale annotated datasets for each downstream task. However, foundation language models struggle with tasks like Named Entity Recognition (NER) due to domain-specific terminologies, fine-grained entities, and semantic ambiguity. The issue is even more pronounced when entities must map directly to pre-existing domain ontologies. This work aims to assess whether foundation large language models (LLMs) can successfully perform ontology-conformal NER in the materials mechanics and fatigue domain. Specifically, we present a comparative evaluation of in-context learning (ICL) with foundation models such as GPT-4 against fine-tuned task-specific language models, including MatSciBERT and DeBERTa. The study is performed on two materials fatigue datasets, which contain annotations at a comparatively fine-grained level adhering to the class definitions of a formal ontology to ensure semantic alignment and cross-dataset interoperability. Both datasets cover adjacent domains to assess how well both NER methodologies generalize when presented with typical domain shifts. Task-specific models are shown to significantly outperform general foundation models on an ontology-constrained NER. Our findings reveal a strong dependence on the quality of few-shot demonstrations in ICL to handle domain-shift. The study also highlights the significance of domain-specific pre-training by comparing task-specific models that differ primarily in their pre-training corpus. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fatigue; Foundation Models; Large Language Models; Literature Mining; Materials Science; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology; Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning; Prompt Engineering; Alanine Aminotransferase; Alanine Aminotransferase; Ambiguity; Article; Context Learning; Fatigue; Human; Knowledge Graph; Language Model; Large Language Model; Mechanics; Mining; Ontology; Prompt Engineering","alanine aminotransferase; ambiguity; article; context learning; fatigue; human; knowledge graph; language model; large language model; mechanics; mining; ontology; prompt engineering","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006735493"

Conventional analysis of vaccine AEs relies on manual review and assignment of AEs to terms in terminology or ontology, which is a time-consuming process and constrained in scope. This study explores the potential of using Large Language Models (LLMs) and LLM text embeddings for efficient and comprehensive vaccine AE analysis. Results: We used Llama-3 LLM to extract AE information from FDA-approved vaccine package inserts for 111 licensed vaccines, including 15 influenza vaccines. Text embeddings were then generated for each vaccine’s AEs using the nomic-embed-text and mxbai-embed-large models. Llama-3 achieved over 80% accuracy in extracting AE text from vaccine package inserts. To further evaluate the performance of text embedding, the vaccines were clustered using two clustering methods: (1) LLM text embedding-based clustering and (2) ontology-based semantic similarity analysis. The ontology-based method mapped AEs to the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and Ontology of Adverse Events (OAE), with semantic similarity analyzed using Lin’s method. Text embeddings were generated for each vaccine’s AE description using the LLM nomic-embed-text and mxbai-embed-large models. Compared to the semantic similarity analysis, the LLM approach was able to capture more differential AE profiles. Furthermore, LLM-derived text embeddings were used to develop a Lasso logistic regression model to predict whether a vaccine is “Live” or “Non-Live”. The term “Non-Live” refers to all vaccines that do not contain live organisms, including inactivated and mRNA vaccines. A comparative analysis showed that, despite similar clustering patterns, the nomic-embed-text model outperformed the other. It achieved 80.00% sensitivity, 83.06% specificity, and 81.89% accuracy in a 10-fold cross-validation. Many AE patterns, with examples demonstrated, were identified from our analysis with AE LLM embeddings. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the effectiveness of LLMs for automated AE extraction and analysis, and LLM text embeddings capture latent information about AEs, enabling more comprehensive knowledge discovery. Our findings suggest that LLMs demonstrate substantial potential for improving vaccine safety and public health research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adverse Event; Fda Package Inserts; Human Phenotype Ontology (hpo); Large Language Models (llm); Liama-3 Model; Ontology Of Adverse Events (oae); Vaccine; Vaccine Ontology (vo); Vaccines; Vaccine; Adverse Drug Reaction; Biological Ontology; Human; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Biological Ontologies; Drug-related Side Effects And Adverse Reactions; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Vaccines","vaccine; adverse drug reaction; biological ontology; human; natural language processing; semantics; Biological Ontologies; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Vaccines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005987831"

Phenotype-based methods commonly rely on comparing phenotypes observed in a patient with databases of genotype-to-phenotype associations using measures of semantic similarity. They are constrained by the quality and completeness of these resources as well as the quality and completeness of patient phenotype annotation. Genotype-to-phenotype associations used by these methods are largely derived from the literature and coded using phenotype ontologies. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been trained on large amounts of text and data and have shown their potential to answer complex questions across multiple domains. Here, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in prioritizing disease-associated genes compared to existing bioinformatics methods. We show that LLMs can prioritize disease-associated genes as well, or better than, dedicated bioinformatics methods relying on pre-defined phenotype similarity, when gene sets range from 5 to 100 candidates. We apply our approach to a cohort of undiagnosed patients with rare diseases and show that LLMs can be used to provide diagnostic support that helps in identifying plausible candidate genes. Our results show that LLMs may offer an alternative to traditional bioinformatics methods to prioritize disease-associated genes based on disease phenotypes. They may, therefore, potentially enhance diagnostic accuracy and simplify the process for rare genetic diseases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Diagnosis Support; Gene Prioritization; Large Language Models; Phenotypes; Rare Diseases; Bioinformatics; Diagnosis; Genetic Association Study; Genetic Predisposition; Genetics; Human; Large Language Model; Phenotype; Procedures; Rare Disease; Computational Biology; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition To Disease; Humans; Large Language Models; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","bioinformatics; diagnosis; genetic association study; genetic predisposition; genetics; human; large language model; phenotype; procedures; rare disease; Computational Biology; Genetic Association Studies; Genetic Predisposition to Disease; Humans; Large Language Models; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003831962"

Thus, predicting ADEs is key to developing safer medications and enhancing patient outcomes. To support this effort, we introduce CT-ADE, a dataset for multilabel ADE prediction in monopharmacy treatments. CT-ADE encompasses 2,497 drugs and 168,984 drug-ADE pairs from clinical trial results, annotated using the MedDRA ontology. Unlike existing resources, CT-ADE integrates treatment and target population data, enabling comparative analyses under varying conditions, such as dosage, administration route, and demographics. In addition, CT-ADE systematically collects all ADEs in the study population, including positive and negative cases. To provide a baseline for ADE prediction performance using the CT-ADE dataset, we conducted analyses using large language models (LLMs). The best LLM achieved an F1-score of 56%, with models incorporating treatment and patient information outperforming by 21%–38% those relying solely on the chemical structure. These findings underscore the importance of contextual information in ADE prediction and establish CT-ADE as a robust resource for safety risk assessment in pharmaceutical research and development. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adverse Drug Reaction; Benchmarking; Clinical Trial (topic); Human; Benchmarking; Clinical Trials As Topic; Drug-related Side Effects And Adverse Reactions; Humans","adverse drug reaction; benchmarking; clinical trial (topic); human; Benchmarking; Clinical Trials as Topic; Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; Humans","Data paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000173742"

However, telephone triage is challenging in pediatrics due to nonspecific symptoms, reliance on parental description, and emotional distress. Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) could improve the accuracy and quality of telephone triage. Despite proven benefits, current CDSSs are not well suited to the nuances of pediatrics. This study aims to develop a CDSS for pediatric emergency telephone triage. Methods: We developed a formal knowledge base (KB) for pediatric telephone triage inspired by the ontology model and implemented a generic medical reasoning system that mimics the clinical reasoning used in pediatric emergency triage. The CDSS is built in three layers (a knowledge layer, a Python-based decision layer, and a web interface layer) and provides real-time recommendations. We assessed its accuracy on 96 fictitious clinical cases. Results: The CDSS uses an ontology-oriented KB that includes 303 concepts and 1780 axioms and a generic algorithm that provides recommendations based on user input, exploring and updating decisions continuously. It demonstrated 100 % internal validity compared to written recommendations and 77.1 % accuracy compared to a trio of experts. The 22.9 % discrepancies were due to experts using additional elements not documented in the written recommendations (11.5 %) or experts making different decisions despite consistent rules in the textual recommendations (10.4 %), emphasizing the challenges of standardized guidelines in this narrow but complex field. Discussion/conclusion: The CDSS provides explainable and interpretable recommendations designed to alleviate healthcare professionals’ cognitive load so that they can focus on complex clinical situations.

Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their potential, these systems still present limited performance and high computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using three challenges from the 2024 edition of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in five of seven unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance, remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing runtime. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific heuristics or fine-tuning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Greedy Search; Large Language Models; Ontology Matching; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Zero-shot Setting; Data Interoperability; Depth First; Greedy Search; Language Model; Large Language Model; Matching System; Ontology Matching; Performance; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Zero-shot Setting; Interoperability","Data interoperability; Depth first; Greedy search; Language model; Large language model; Matching system; Ontology matching; Performance; Retrieval augmented generation; Zero-shot setting; Interoperability","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004876116"

Modulating these interactions with small molecule PPI modulators has emerged as a promising strategy for treating such diseases. However, current computational approaches for screening PPI modulators often fail to integrate biomolecular expertise and lack the elucidation of interaction mechanisms. Here, we propose a knowledge-fused modulator-PPI interaction prediction method (KFPPIMI) to alleviate these issues. KFPPIMI constructs separate representation models for modulators and proteins, each of which integrates external knowledge from textual and graph-based data sources via a language modeling framework. The fusion of the nuanced expression of natural language with the structural attributes of biomolecules provides KFPPIMI with a holistic view of modulator-PPI interactions. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of KFPPIMI and its individual components. The results show that KFPPIMI outperforms existing methods in different scenarios. Moreover, the modulator and protein representation model can be successfully applied to their respective downstream tasks with comparable performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Knowledge Fusion; Language Model; Pretrain; Protein-protein Interaction Modulator; Gene Transfer; Biological Process; Gene Ontology; Human Disease; Knowledge Fusion; Language Model; Pretrain; Protein-protein Interaction Modulator; Protein-protein Interactions; Representation Model; Small Molecules; Genome","Gene transfer; Biological process; Gene ontology; Human disease; Knowledge fusion; Language model; Pretrain; Protein-protein interaction modulator; Protein-protein interactions; Representation model; Small molecules; Genome","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004221272"

In many of these tasks, experts usually manually establish these relationships by carefully analyzing each concept's meaning and considering the domain knowledge elicited from domain practitioners or from domain literature. While some studies automate parts of the process of building knowledge models, most focus on identifying general concepts or rely on static word embeddings, which fail to address challenges like polysemy and contextual ambiguity. This research addresses the problem of classifying semantic relationships between concepts, focusing on hypernym and holonym relations. We propose an approach based on the pre-trained language model BERT to classify these relationships between concepts. We assume that we can represent the concept's semantics using their definitions in natural language. To evaluate this approach, we developed a methodology to construct a labeled dataset of definitions of concepts using WordNet as a reference. Thus, our proposed approach classifies the relations based solely on natural language expressions representing the concept's definition. Our experiments showed notable classification results, achieving an F1 score of 96 % in the classification of holonyms, hypernyms, and concepts that are not related by any of these relations, indicating that our approach can accurately predict semantic relations between concepts using only their natural language definitions as input. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Lexical Classification; Machine Learning; Nlp; Relation Classification; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Acquisition; Knowledge Graph; Labeled Data; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Bert; Explicit Knowledge; Hypernyms; Knowledge Model; Language Model; Lexical Classification; Machine-learning; Natural Languages; Relation Classifications; Relationship Between Concepts; Semantics","Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge graph; Labeled data; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; BERT; Explicit knowledge; Hypernyms; Knowledge model; Language model; Lexical classification; Machine-learning; Natural languages; Relation classifications; Relationship between concepts; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012097374"

Traditional machine learning and language model-based methods often lack transparency and struggle with multi-label prediction across complex taxonomies such as ICD, CPT, and LOINC. Existing topic modeling techniques, while interpretable, are rarely optimized for the clinical coding task and fail to leverage the rich semantic structure inherent in medical texts and ontologies. MethodsWe propose MedConGTM, a novel dual-view graph contrastive topic modeling framework tailored for interpretable and multi-label clinical code prediction. MedConGTM constructs two semantic views of each document: a document-token semantic graph and a document-code co-assignment graph. These views are jointly optimized through a novel dual-view contrastive learning objective that maximizes the mutual information between topic distributions inferred from text and task-specific code views. We introduce a code-aware word co-occurrence graph enhanced with medical ontologies and propose a hierarchy-sensitive contrastive loss that incorporates structural relationships between clinical codes. To ensure transparency, we design a topic-to-code attention decoder that links predicted codes to interpretable latent topics and salient textual evidence. ResultsExperiments on MIMIC-III and i2b2 datasets demonstrate that MedConGTM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both code prediction accuracy and topic coherence. It also provides interpretable code rationales aligned with clinical semantics. ConclusionsMedConGTM offers a powerful, interpretable, and clinically grounded solution for automated ICD/CPT/LOINC code assignment, bridging the gap between topic modeling, contrastive learning, and real-world healthcare applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Code Prediction; Contrastive Learning; Multi-label Classification; Topic Modeling; Classification (of Information); Health Care; Latent Semantic Analysis; Learning Systems; Medical Computing; Medical Informatics; Ontology; Semantics; Text Processing; Clinical Code Prediction; Code Assignments; Code Predictions; Free Texts; Health Care Informatics; Machine Languages; Medical Record; Multi-label Classifications; Multi-labels; Topic Modeling; Forecasting","Classification (of information); Health care; Latent semantic analysis; Learning systems; Medical computing; Medical informatics; Ontology; Semantics; Text processing; Clinical code prediction; Code assignments; Code predictions; Free texts; Health care informatics; Machine languages; Medical record; Multi-label classifications; Multi-labels; Topic Modeling; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011099983"

This study addresses the necessity for mapping between the SIGTAP vocabulary used in Brazilian healthcare systems and the broader medical terms of the OMOP CDM terminologies. Two distinct pipelines are evaluated for the vocabulary mapping process, focusing on two subsets of the SIGTAP vocabulary: medicines and medical procedures. The first pipeline utilizes textual embeddings for semantic similarity evaluation, followed by Large Language Models (LLMs) for correspondences selection through a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach. In the second pipeline, LLM agents employ predefined protocols for vocabulary mapping and query refinement. Our results show comparable performance between pipelines in both the Procedures subset (F<inf>1</inf> of 0.684 versus 0.678), and the Medicines subset (F<inf>1</inf> of 0.846 versus 0.839), indicating the viability of the multi-stage filtering approach. The second pipeline demonstrates an advantage over the first in terms of recall, highlighting the efficacy of dynamic query refinement by the agent.

The efficiency and accuracy of medical code assignment is a significant challenge affecting healthcare. However, in clinical practice, Electronic Health Records (EHRs) data are usually complex, heterogeneous, non-standard and unstructured, and the manual coding process is time-consuming, laborious and error-prone. Traditional machine learning methods struggle to extract significant semantic information from clinical texts accurately, but the latest progress in Deep Learning (DL) has shown promising results to address these issues. Objective: This paper comprehensively reviewed recent advancements in utilizing deep learning for automatic ICD coding, which aimed to reveal prominent challenges and emerging development trends by summarizing and analyzing the model's year, design motivation, deep neural networks, and auxiliary data. Methods: This review introduced systematic literature on automatic ICD coding methods based on deep learning. We screened 5 online databases, including Web of Science, SpringerLink, PubMed, ACM, and IEEE digital library, and collected 53 published articles related to deep learning-based ICD coding from 2017 to 2023. Results: These deep neural network methods aimed to overcome some challenges, such as lengthy and noisy clinical text, high dimensionality and functional relationships of medical codes, and long-tail label distribution. The Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), attention mechanisms, Transformers, Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs), etc, have become popular to address prominent issues in ICD coding. Meanwhile, introducing medical ontology within the ICD coding system (code description and code hierarchy) and external knowledge (Wikipedia articles, tabular data, Clinical Classification Software (CCS), fine-tuning PLMs based on biomedical corpus, entity recognition and concept extraction) has become an emerging trend for automatic ICD coding. Conclusion: This paper provided a comprehensive review of recent literature on applying deep learning technology to improve medical code assignment from a unique perspective. Multiple neural network methods (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, PLMs, especially attention mechanisms) have been successfully applied in ICD tasks and achieved excellent performance. Various medical auxiliary data has also proven valuable in enhancing model feature representation and classification performance. Our in-depth and systematic analysis suggested that the automatic ICD coding method based on deep learning has a bright future in healthcare.

Traditional approaches, which often rely on ontologies, knowledge graphs, or digital twins (DTs) for knowledge representation, and rule-based algorithms for inference, are becoming insufficient. The emergence of generative AI, particularly large language models (LLM) and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), offers a more efficient and intelligent alternative. However, the performance of an RAG system is heavily dependent on the quality of retrieval results, which can be compromised by domain-specific knowledge and retrieval distractors. To address this challenge, we propose to enhance RAG systems tailored for the manufacturing industry in two aspects. First, we utilize the Asset Administration Shell (AAS), which represents the German industrial perspective on cognitive DTs, to create a representation of assets and knowledge in standardized information models. This establishes a robust foundation for the retrieval sources. Second, we propose a contrastive selection loss (CSL) to fine-tune an open-source LLM to refine the retrieval results. Fine-tuned LLMs possess higher efficiency and accuracy on task- and domain-specific datasets, while the CSL further enhances the model's ability to distinguish true positives from similar distractors. The enhanced RAG system is demonstrated in a robotic work cell integration use case and evaluated through a novel evaluation protocol. Additionally, the retrieval effectiveness of the RAG system, specifically the LLM fine-tuned with CSL, is extensively validated through statistical experiments. The results confirm its superior performance over state-of-the-art methods, including GPT-4 with in-context learning prompts and other fine-tuned models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Administration Shell; Digital Twin; Entity Matching; Large Language Model; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Digital Twin; Interoperability; Knowledge Representation; Robotics; Asset Administration Shell; Entity Matching; Generation Systems; Knowledge-representation; Language Model; Large Language Model; Manufacturing Sector; Performance; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Traditional Approachs; Inference Engines","Digital twin; Interoperability; Knowledge representation; Robotics; Asset administration shell; Entity matching; Generation systems; Knowledge-representation; Language model; Large language model; Manufacturing sector; Performance; Retrieval-augmented generation; Traditional approachs; Inference engines","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009051298"

To address this gap, we developed an information framework powered by large language models (LLMs) to extract detailed electrification-related technology information from building permit text data. While U.S. building permit data is publicly available, it is often unstructured, incomplete, and highly variable. Our LLM-enabled system addresses these challenges by constructing a comprehensive building-level ontology that captures detailed attributes for six key electrification technologies: photovoltaics, electric vehicle chargers, energy storage systems, electric service panels, water heaters, and heat pumps. Our information extraction system exhibits strong performance, achieving 0.96 recall and 0.88 precision on our human-annotated test dataset. We experimentally deploy our framework on permit data in San Francisco County, California, demonstrating that it surpasses all existing public sources of electrification information in both spatiotemporal resolution and coverage.

Fire weather indices, which assess wildfire risk and predict resource demands, are vital. With the rise of sensor networks in fields like healthcare and environmental monitoring, semantic sensor networks are increasingly used to gather climatic data such as wind speed, temperature, and humidity. However, processing these data streams to determine fire weather indices presents challenges, underscoring the growing importance of effective forest fire detection. This paper discusses using Apache Spark for early forest fire detection, enhancing fire risk prediction with meteorological and geographical data. Building on our previous development of Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies and Semantic Web Rules Language (SWRL) for managing forest fires in Monesterial Natural Park, we expanded SWRL to improve a Decision Support System (DSS) using a Large Language Models (LLMs) and Spark framework. We implemented real-time alerts with Spark streaming, tailored to various fire scenarios, and validated our approach using ontology metrics, query-based evaluations, LLMs score precision, F1 score, and recall measures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dss; Forest Fire; Llms; Spark; Ssn; Big Data; Data Streams; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Deforestation; Fire Detectors; Fire Hazards; Fires; Information Management; Meteorology; Ontology; Semantic Web; Sensor Networks; Wind; Decision Supports; Fire Weather Index; Forest Fires; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Semantic Sensor Network; Semantic Sensors; Sensors Network; Support Systems; Electric Sparks","Big data; Data streams; Decision making; Decision support systems; Deforestation; Fire detectors; Fire hazards; Fires; Information management; Meteorology; Ontology; Semantic Web; Sensor networks; Wind; Decision supports; Fire weather index; Forest fires; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Semantic sensor network; Semantic sensors; Sensors network; Support systems; Electric sparks","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013848357"

Methods: Technically, at initialisation stage, K-Tokeniser populates global representations of tokens based on semantic types of domain concepts (such as drugs or diseases) from either a domain ontology like Unified Medical Language System or the training data of the task related corpus. At training or inference stage, sentence level localised context will be utilised for choosing the optimal global token representation to realise the semantic-based tokenisation. To avoid pretraining using the new tokeniser, an embedding initialisation approach is proposed to generate representations for new tokens. Results: Using three transformer-based language models, a comprehensive set of experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets for evaluating K-Tokeniser in a wide range of clinical text analytics tasks including clinical concept and relation extraction, automated clinical coding, clinical phenotype identification, and clinical research article classification. Overall, our models demonstrate consistent improvements over their counterparts in all tasks. In particular, substantial improvements are observed in the automated clinical coding task with 13% increase on Micro F<inf>1</inf> score. Furthermore, K-Tokeniser also shows significant capacities in facilitating quicker convergence of language models. Conclusion: Models built using K-Tokeniser have shown faster convergence. Specifically,the language models would only require 50% of the training data to achieve the best performance of the baseline tokeniser using all training data in the concept extraction task and less than 20% of the data for the automated coding task. It is worth mentioning that all these improvements require no pre-training process, making the approach generalisable.

The rapid increase in the volume of geoscience data makes it challenging to acquire knowledge quickly. In this study, we proposed and built a workflow that employs knowledge graph techniques, deep learning, question templates, and matching algorithms to provide a lightweight question-answering service for field-based geologists involved in mineral resource surveys. Initially, we utilized deep-learning-based geological entities and their semantic relation recognition, along with relational data mapping, to construct the mineral resource survey knowledge graph based on the ontology model. We then employed question template matching, a geological entity recognition model, and a sentence transformer to determine the optimal question template and generate a query statement for knowledge acquisition from a knowledge graph based on the Cypher language. Subsequently, we utilized a subgraph and a short abstract to express the results. The comparison with large language models and retrieval-augmented generation indicates that our solution is suitable for field-based mineral source surveys in a poor network environment with low-performance devices, data privacy concerns, and narrowly focused topics. The results also suggest that further studies on geoscience pre-trained models, an informative library of question templates, and multimodal knowledge graphs are necessary to improve the performance of the knowledge graph-driven question-answering system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent Service; Knowledge Graph-driven Question Answering; Mineral Resource Survey; Question Answering; Sentence Transformer; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Geology; Graph Algorithms; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Acquisition; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Transfer; Learning Algorithms; Mineral Exploration; Mineral Resources; Ontology; Query Languages; Question Answering; Semantics; Surveying; Geological-entities; Geoscience Data; Intelligent Services; Knowledge Graph-driven Question Answering; Knowledge Graphs; Mineral Resource Survey; Question Answering; Question Answering Systems; Sentence Transformer; Template Matching","Data mining; Deep learning; Geology; Graph algorithms; Graphic methods; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge graph; Knowledge transfer; Learning algorithms; Mineral exploration; Mineral resources; Ontology; Query languages; Question answering; Semantics; Surveying; Geological-entities; Geoscience data; Intelligent Services; Knowledge graph-driven question answering; Knowledge graphs; Mineral resource survey; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Sentence transformer; Template matching","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011484817"

However, current PDMS lack cognitive capabilities, particularly in reasoning and synthesis, which are essential for conceptual design. As a result, designers face challenges in retrieving relevant analogies, establishing meaningful mappings, and integrating knowledge into new design concepts. This paper proposes a computational conceptual product design approach that integrates Large Language Models’ (LLMs) knowledge representation with an analogy-based structured retrieval mechanism, supporting designers to explore and recombine design patterns and functionalities in an intuitive manner. Benefiting from the zero-shot learning and prompting capabilities of LLMs, given a source domain, this approach allows reasoning target domain based on abstract correspondences in both morphological and semantic associations. A template for the combinational regulation of the reuse of analogical knowledge has also been formulated. By decomposing analogical knowledge into ontological distinction, inspirational feature recognition, and associative mapping explanation, a creative conceptual design stimulation path is formed. An interactive tool named ViMimic based on this approach has been developed through a case study with 18 participants. Evaluation results demonstrate that the approach improves creative performance, increasing the novelty and functionality of conceptual designs by 51% and 22% respectively according to expert evaluations. It also boosts the efficiency and diversity of analogy mapping by 30% based on objective measures, while enhancing creative experiences and reducing cognitive load as measured in the participants’ self-assessment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Analogy; Artificial Intelligence; Conceptual Product Design; Creativity; Innovation; Large Language Models; Domain Knowledge; Integrated Circuit Layout; Intellectual Property Core; Photomapping; Printed Circuit Design; Zero-shot Learning; 'current; Analogy; Cognitive Capability; Creatives; Creativity; Design Approaches; Innovation; Language Model; Large Language Model; Product Innovation; Conceptual Design","Domain Knowledge; Integrated circuit layout; Intellectual property core; Photomapping; Printed circuit design; Zero-shot learning; 'current; Analogy; Cognitive capability; Creatives; Creativity; Design approaches; Innovation; Language model; Large language model; Product innovation; Conceptual design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007293444"

We also identify conceptual debates within the SDT literature and between SDT and other literatures, and discuss their relevance with respect to PA. We particularly focus on tripartite conceptualizations of interpersonal styles and psychological needs, whether there are more than three basic psychological needs, and the use of financial incentives and competition to promote PA.

Evaluating the efficacy of new drugs in DS preclinical models and mapping them to human phenotypes of DS through analysis of published literature is an important goal for improving outcomes in this rare pediatric epilepsy. Materials and Methods: Large language models (LLM) have demonstrated great promise in parsing published literature; however, the performance of LLMs falls short in medical applications. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of domain ontology developed by human experts to optimize LLMs for medical text processing in a rare disease. Utilizing a benchmark dataset that describes the efficacy of 17 ASMs tested in preclinical models and DS patients, we define a new ontology-augmented phased in-context learning (PCL) approach to process 4935 full-text DS articles. We expand this analysis to 7 new drugs that demonstrate efficacy in reducing seizures to identify gaps in current knowledge for designing new experimental studies for drug discovery in DS. Results: Few-shot or in-context learning is a foundational capability of LLMs and the few-shot learning capability of the Gemini 1.0 Pro version LLM dramatically increases when we augment prompts with the DS epilepsy ontology. The DS epilepsy ontology is the largest epilepsy and seizure ontology in clinical use that was developed by DS basic scientists and clinical neurologists. The ontology-augmented PCL prompt achieves 100% accuracy in reproducing the benchmark drug efficacy dataset for 17 ASMs with only two examples for in-context learning. Conclusion: The new ontology-augmented PCL approach significantly accelerates the few-shot learning capabilities of the Gemini LLM, thereby reducing the number of required examples and time needed to optimize LLMs for medical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Ontology; Dravet Syndrome; Drug Efficacy; Few-shot Learning; Optimizing Large Language Models; Bromide; Cannabidiol; Carbamazepine; Clemizole; Clobazam; Clonazepam; Diazepam; Ethosuximide; Fenfluramine; Gabapentin; Lamotrigine; Levetiracetam; Lorcaserin; Oxcarbazepine; Perampanel; Phenobarbital; Phenytoin; Rufinamide; Soticlestat; Stiripentol; Topiramate; Trazodone; Valproic Acid; Zonisamide; Anticonvulsants; Belviq; Biomedical Ontologies; Context Learning; Dravet Syndrome; Drug Efficacy; Few-shot Learning; In Contexts; Language Model; Learning Capabilities; Ontology's; Optimizing Large Language Model; Neurophysiology; Anticonvulsive Agent; Bromide; Cannabidiol; Carbamazepine; Clemizole; Clobazam; Clonazepam; Diazepam; Ethosuximide; Fenfluramine; Gabapentin; Lamotrigine; Levetiracetam; Lorcaserin; New Drug; Oxcarbazepine; Perampanel; Phenobarbital; Phenytoin; Rufinamide; Soticlestat; Stiripentol; Topiramate; Trazodone; Valproic Acid; Zonisamide; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Article; Benchmarking; Child; Context Learning; Controlled Study; Data Extraction; Drug Efficacy; Experimental Seizure; Few Shot Learning; Human; Large Language Model; Mouse; Nonhuman; Ontology; Preclinical Study; Rare Disease; Severe Myoclonic Epilepsy In Infancy; Unprovoked Seizure; Word Processing; Biological Ontology; Drug Therapy; Machine Learning; Myoclonus Epilepsy; Natural Language Processing; Anticonvulsants; Biological Ontologies; Child; Epilepsies, Myoclonic; Humans; Large Language Models; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Rare Diseases","Biomedical ontologies; Context learning; Dravet syndrome; Drug efficacy; Few-shot learning; In contexts; Language model; Learning capabilities; Ontology's; Optimizing large language model; Neurophysiology; anticonvulsive agent; bromide; cannabidiol; carbamazepine; clemizole; clobazam; clonazepam; diazepam; ethosuximide; fenfluramine; gabapentin; lamotrigine; levetiracetam; lorcaserin; new drug; oxcarbazepine; perampanel; phenobarbital; phenytoin; rufinamide; soticlestat; stiripentol; topiramate; trazodone; valproic acid; zonisamide; animal experiment; animal model; Article; benchmarking; child; context learning; controlled study; data extraction; drug efficacy; experimental seizure; few shot learning; human; large language model; mouse; nonhuman; ontology; preclinical study; rare disease; severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy; unprovoked seizure; word processing; biological ontology; drug therapy; machine learning; myoclonus epilepsy; natural language processing; Anticonvulsants; Biological Ontologies; Child; Epilepsies, Myoclonic; Humans; Large Language Models; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Rare Diseases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003927877"

However, the “black-box” nature of these representations limits transparency and explainability, posing challenges for human–AI collaboration and leaving open questions about their human-interpretable features. Here, we leverage sparse autoencoders (SAEs) and a variant, transcoders, from natural language processing to extract, in a completely unsupervised fashion, interpretable sparse features present in both protein-level and amino acid (AA)-level representations from ESM2, a popular PLM. Unlike other approaches such as training probes for features, the extraction of features by the SAE is performed without any supervision. We find that many sparse features extracted from SAEs trained on protein-level representations are tightly associated with Gene Ontology (GO) terms across all levels of the GO hierarchy. We also use Anthropic’s Claude to automate the interpretation of sparse features for both protein-level and AA-level representations and find that many of these features correspond to specific protein families and functions such as the NAD Kinase, IUNH, and the PTH family, as well as proteins involved in methyltransferase activity and in olfactory and gustatory sensory perception. We show that sparse features are more interpretable than ESM2 neurons across all our trained SAEs and transcoders. These findings demonstrate that SAEs offer a promising unsupervised approach for disentangling biologically relevant information present in PLM representations, thus aiding interpretability.

However, the lack of well-defined terminology and semantic models harms the development of decision support systems. Conceptualizing the tobacco production domain is challenging due to its ambiguous terminology and the complexity involved in considering environmental, soil, disease, and pest management factors. We present an Ontology of Tobacco Production (OnTop), designed to assist tobacco production in optimizing crop management practices and placing environmental factors within a formal framework. To the best of available knowledge, this study is the first to formalize the tobacco production lifecycle integrated with soil and climate data. It includes symbolic and description logic for reasoning and automation. This paper presents the proposal for the core set (main classes) and the application of OnTop to enrich a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide an ontology-based decision support prompt. OnTop allows actionable recommendations based on environmental, agronomic, and productivity data. The main contributions of this paper are: i) a domain ontology that formalizes knowledge on data-driven tobacco production; and ii) a queryable framework (enriched LLM), which allows experts to obtain complex agronomic answers. OnTop offers an extensible framework for decision making in tobacco farming and paves the way for further innovations in ontologies and LLM-based decision support systems for the agricultural domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Representation; Large Language Model; Ontology; Tobacco","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014364959"

A key challenge lies in the evolving nature of concepts embedded in the growing body of research publications. As concepts evolve over time (e.g., keywords like global warming become more commonly referred to as climate change), past research may become harder to find and interpret in a modern context. This phenomenon, known as concept drift, affects how research topics and keywords are understood, categorized, and retrieved. Beyond temporal drift, such variations also occur across geographic space, reflecting differences in local policies, research priorities, and so forth. In this work, we introduce the notion of spatio-temporal concept drift to capture how concepts in scientific texts evolve across both space and time. Using a scientometric dataset in geographic information science, we detect how research keywords drifted across countries and years using word embeddings. By detecting spatio-temporal concept drift, we can better align archival research and bridge regional differences, ensuring scientific knowledge remains findable and interoperable within evolving research landscapes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concept Drift; Large Language Models; Ontology; Research Data Management; Artificial Intelligence; Global Warming; Information Management; Natural Language Processing Systems; Concept Drifts; Growing Bodies; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Research Communities; Research Data Managements; Scientific Texts; Spatio-temporal; Temporal Concepts; Ontology","Artificial intelligence; Global warming; Information management; Natural language processing systems; Concept drifts; Growing bodies; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Research communities; Research data managements; Scientific texts; Spatio-temporal; Temporal concepts; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013844283"

However, the inherent complexity of buildings, their long operational lifespans, and the specific nature of the construction industry pose significant challenges in creating digital twins for buildings. Intelligent digital twins (IDTs) address these challenges by integrating existing digital twin models with AI, enabling a comprehensive representation of the building lifecycle while incorporating expert input. This study proposes an AI agent-based IDT framework using an ontological approach, where AI agents are engineered by DT administrators with building operations and maintenance (O&M) data, information, and applications within an ontological DT environment. Data and information generated within this environment are expressed in the DT ontology, enabling AI agents to gain a holistic understanding of the target system. Applications are integrated as a tool, thereby enabling AI agents to expand their actions and gain additional information from results. To validate this framework, virtual in-situ modeling (VIM) and fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) algorithms were implemented as DT applications to demonstrate the operation of the IDT system. Four case studies were conducted to demonstrate IDT-enabled O&M services, and LangSmith was used to visualize the AI agents' reasoning process as part of the result validation. It shows that AI agents have capabilities of performing building O&M tasks with high-level reasoning. The significance of this study lies in demonstrating the feasibility of implementing IDT models in building O&M by enabling AI agents to provide comprehensive, domain-specific knowledge and perform operational tasks, thereby serving as an assistant for both users and operators. Finally, this study underscores the critical role of engineers in managing and maintaining ontology and applications within the DT environment. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Agent; Building Informatics; Built Environments; Digital Twin (dt); Intelligent Digital Twin (idt); Large Language Model (llm); Ontology; Operation And Maintenance (o&m); Architectural Design; Ai Agent; Building Informatics; Built Environment; Digital Twin; Intelligent Digital Twin; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Operation And Maintenance; Operations And Maintenance; Construction Industry","Architectural design; AI agent; Building informatics; Built environment; Digital twin; Intelligent digital twin; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Operation and maintenance; Operations and maintenance; Construction industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004815812"

Central to this framework is the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, where LLM-based agents function as dynamic orchestrators, synthesizing multimodal knowledge, specialized models, and experimental robotics to enable fully autonomous discovery. Drawing from a comprehensive review of LLMs’ transformative impact across representative applications in materials science, including data extraction, property prediction, structure generation, synthesis planning, and self-driven labs, this study underscores how LLMs are revolutionizing traditional tasks, catalyzing the agent-in-the-loop paradigm, and bridging the ontology-concept-computation-experiment continuum. Then the unique challenges of scaling up LLM adoption are discussed, particularly those arising from the misalignment of foundation LLMs with materials-specific knowledge, emphasizing the need to enhance adaptability, efficiency, sustainability, interpretability, and trustworthiness in the pursuit of GMI. Nonetheless, it is important to recognize that LLMs are not universally efficient. Their substantial resource demands and inconsistent performance call for careful deployment based on demonstrated task suitability.

There is a pressing need to standardise its components and relationships. Limitations of the existing LHS frameworks include their lack of flexibility to adapt to sociotechnical changes and inability to guide the automatic evaluation initiative on health organisational performance. Ontologies facilitate consensus by aligning stakeholders on a shared vocabulary and structure, which can reduce ambiguity in communication and foster better collaboration across different stakeholder groups.

We followed a four-step realist synthesis methodology to develop SMARTLHS: (1) ontology requirements specification, (2) iterative and inductive ontology conceptualisation, (3) concept and relationship comparison and development, (4) ontology evaluation and refinement. The resultant SMARTLHS ontology comprises 475 unique classes and subclasses (concepts) and 135 object properties. The object properties define the relationships between these classes. SMARTLHS addresses the critical limitations of the existing LHS frameworks. It serves as a knowledge base for healthcare professionals.

To address these challenges, this study proposes a knowledge extraction method that combines large language models (LLMs) with conventional small models. Twenty-three entity types and 35 relation types were defined, and an urban planning standards ontology was constructed. With annotation rules designed, an LLM-based annotated corpus, including 4905 sentences and 17,056 triples, was constructed. The Urban Plan-Bert-Global Pointer-based Linking (UPB-GPLinker) was built for entity–relation joint extraction based on a customized dictionary and a pretrained Urban Plan-Bert (UPB) model.

This paper aims to improve flood-risk communication for community leaders by exploring the application of artificial intelligence. We categorize U.S. flood information sources, review communication modalities and channels, synthesize the literature on community leaders’ roles in risk communication, and analyze existing technological tools. Our analysis reveals three key challenges: the fragmentation of flood information, information overload that impedes decision-making, and the absence of a unified communication platform to address these issues. We find that AI techniques can organize data and significantly enhance communication effectiveness, particularly when delivered through infographics and social media channels. Based on these findings, we propose FLAI (Flood Language AI), an AI-driven flood communication platform that unifies fragmented flood data sources. FLAI employs knowledge graphs to structure fragmented data sources and utilizes a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework to enable large language models (LLMs) to produce contextualized narratives, including infographics, maps, and cost–benefit analyses. Beyond flood management, FLAI’s framework demonstrates how AI can transform public service data management and institutional AI readiness. By centralizing and organizing information, FLAI can significantly reduce the cognitive burden on community leaders, helping them communicate timely, actionable insights to save lives and build flood resilience. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Community Resilience; Flood-risk Communication; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Storytelling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014391633"

Knowledge graphs (KGs) effectively model APT attack processes through node-link architectures; however, the scarcity of high-quality, annotated datasets limits research progress. The primary challenge lies in balancing annotation cost and quality, particularly due to the lack of quality assessment methods for graph annotation data. This study addresses these issues by extending existing APT ontology definitions and developing a dynamic, trustworthy annotation framework for APT knowledge graphs. The framework introduces a self-verification mechanism utilizing large language model (LLM) annotation consistency and establishes a comprehensive graph data metric system for problem localization in annotated data. This metric system, based on structural properties, logical consistency, and APT attack chain characteristics, comprehensively evaluates annotation quality across representation, syntax semantics, and topological structure. Experimental results show that this framework significantly reduces annotation costs while maintaining quality. Using this framework, we constructed LAPTKG, a reliable dataset containing over 10,000 entities and relations. Baseline evaluations show substantial improvements in entity and relation extraction performance after metric correction, validating the framework’s effectiveness in reliable APT knowledge graph dataset construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Apt; Automated Annotation Framework; Entity Relationship Dataset; Graph Data Evaluation; Threat Intelligence; Cybersecurity; Data Consistency; Data Quality; Graph Theory; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Advanced Persistent Threat; Auto-annotation; Automated Annotation Framework; Data Evaluation; Entity Relationship Dataset; Entity-relationship; Graph Data; Graph Data Evaluation; Knowledge Graphs; Threat Intelligence; Semantics","Cybersecurity; Data consistency; Data quality; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Ontology; Advanced persistent threat; Auto-annotation; Automated annotation framework; Data evaluation; Entity relationship dataset; Entity-relationship; Graph data; Graph data evaluation; Knowledge graphs; Threat intelligence; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014382130"

However, the scarcity of public fault diagnosis data and the lack of automated knowledge extraction pose major challenges to knowledge graph construction. To address issues such as ambiguous entity boundaries, severe entity nesting, and poor entity extraction performance in fault diagnosis texts, this paper proposes a dual-strategy progressive knowledge extraction framework. First, to tackle the high complexity of fault diagnosis texts, an entity recognition model named RoBERTa-zh-BiLSTM-MUL-CRF is designed, improving the accuracy of nested entity extraction. Second, leveraging the semantic understanding capability of large language models, a progressive prompting strategy is adopted for ontology alignment and relation extraction, achieving automated knowledge extraction. Experimental results show that the proposed named entity recognition model outperforms traditional models, with improvements of 3.87%, 5.82%, and 2.05% in F1-score, recall, and precision, respectively. Additionally, the large language model demonstrates better performance in ontology alignment compared to traditional machine learning models. The constructed knowledge graph for household appliance fault diagnosis integrates structured fault diagnosis information. It effectively processes unstructured fault texts and supports visual queries and entity tracing. This framework can assist maintenance personnel in making rapid judgments, thereby improving fault diagnosis efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Home Appliance Faults; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Named Entity Recognition; Relationship Extraction; Extraction; Failure Analysis; Fault Detection; Graph Theory; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Learning Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Entity Extractions; Faults Diagnosis; Home Appliance Fault; Knowledge Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Performance; Relationship Extraction; Domestic Appliances","Extraction; Failure analysis; Fault detection; Graph theory; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Learning systems; Ontology; Semantics; Entity extractions; Faults diagnosis; Home appliance fault; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Performance; Relationship extraction; Domestic appliances","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014352969"

However, they are constrained by limited data modalities and low accuracy in information extraction. A multimodal water conservancy project risk knowledge graph is proposed in this study, along with a synergistic strategy involving multimodal large language models Risk decision-making generation is facilitated through a multi-agent agentic retrieval-augmented generation framework. To enhance visual recognition, a DenseNet-based image classification model is improved by incorporating single-head self-attention and coordinate attention mechanisms. For textual data, risk entities such as locations, components, and events are extracted using a BERT-BiLSTM-CRF architecture. These extracted entities serve as the foundation for constructing the multimodal knowledge graph. To support generation, a multi-agent agentic retrieval-augmented generation mechanism is introduced. This mechanism enhances the reliability and interpretability of risk decision-making outputs. In experiments, the enhanced DenseNet model outperforms the original baseline in both precision and recall for image recognition tasks. In risk decision-making tasks, the proposed approach—combining a multimodal knowledge graph with a multi-agent agentic retrieval-augmented generation method—achieves strong performance on BERTScore and ROUGE-L metrics.

However, the current landscape of biological pre-trained language models suffers from a shortcoming, i.e., their inability to grasp the intricacies of molecular interactions, such as ncRNA-protein interactions. It is in this context that our paper introduces a two-tower computational framework, termed RPIPLM, which brings forth a new paradigm for the prediction of ncRNA-protein interactions. The core of RPIPLM lies in its harnessing of the pre-trained RNA language model and protein language model to process ncRNA and protein sequences, thereby enabling the transfer of the general knowledge gained from self-supervised learning of vast data to ncRNA-protein interaction tasks. Additionally, to learn the intricate interaction patterns between RNA and protein embeddings across diverse scales, we employ a fusion of scaled dot-product self-attention mechanism and Multi-scale convolution operations on the output of the dual-tower architecture, effectively capturing both global and local information. Furthermore, we introduce supervised contrastive learning into the training of RPIPLM, enabling the model to effectively capture discriminative information by distinguishing between interacting and non-interacting samples in the learned representations. Through extensive experiments and an interpretability study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RPIPLM and its superiority over other methods, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.

Identifying the substrates they translocate across membranes is important for many fields of research, such as metabolomics, pharmacology, and biotechnology. In this study, we leverage recent advances in deep learning, such as amino acid sequence embeddings with protein language models (pLMs), highly accurate 3D structure predictions with AlphaFold 2, and structure-encoding 3Di sequences from FoldSeek, for predicting substrates of membrane transporters. We test new deep learning features derived from both sequence and structure, and compare them to the previously best-performing protein encodings, which were made up of amino acid k-mer frequencies and evolutionary information from PSSMs. Furthermore, we compare the performance of these features either using a previously developed SVM model, or with a regularized feedforward neural network (FNN). When evaluating these models on sugar and amino acid carriers in A. thaliana, as well as on three types of ion channels in human, we found that both the DL-based features and the FNN model led to a better and more consistent classification performance compared to previous methods.

This review aims to survey recent developments in catalysis KGs, describe the main techniques for graph construction, and highlight how artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), enhances graph generation and query. We conducted a systematic analysis of the literature, focusing on ontology-guided text mining pipelines, graph population methods, and maintenance strategies. Our review identifies key trends: ontology-based approaches enable the automated extraction of domain knowledge, LLM-driven retrieval-augmented generation supports natural-language queries, and scalable graph architectures range from a few thousand to over a million triples. We discuss state-of-the-art applications, such as catalyst recommendation systems and reaction mechanism discovery tools, and examine the major challenges, including data heterogeneity, ontology alignment, and long-term graph curation. We conclude that KGs, when combined with AI methods, hold significant promise for accelerating catalyst discovery and knowledge management, but progress depends on establishing community standards for ontology development and maintenance.

These raised spots result from anthocyanin accumulation in the proliferating parenchymal and epidermal cells. However, molecular mechanisms regulating anthocyanin accumulation in raised spots remain uncharacterized. In this study, through a comparative transcriptome analysis of L. leichtlinii during raised spot formation, we identified LlbZIP11, a bZIP family transcription factor, as a candidate regulator of this process. Gene expression analysis revealed that the expression pattern of LlbZIP11 was similar to those of LlMYB19S, a MYB transcription factor involved in raised spot anthocyanin pigmentation, and anthocyanin biosynthesis genes. Functional validation demonstrated that LlbZIP11 positively regulates tepal spot formation and anthocyanin accumulation by upregulating LlMYB19S and anthocyanin-related genes. Dual-luciferase and yeast one-hybrid assays confirmed that LlbZIP11 binds to the LlMYB19S promoter to activate its transcription. These findings indicate that LlbZIP11 activates LlMYB19S, promoting anthocyanin accumulation in raised spots of L. leichtlinii. This study expands the understanding of anthocyanin regulatory networks in diverse floral pigmentation patterns and provides a foundation for further investigations into the mechanisms underlying raised spot formation in Lilium. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Anthocyanin Accumulation; Lilium Leichtlinii; Raised Spots; Anthocyanins; Basic-leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Plant Proteins; Transcription Factors; Ccd Camera; Cdna Synthesis Supermix; Diamond Software; Graphpad Prism 8.0.2; Hifair Ii 1st Strand Cdna Synthesis Supermix For Qpcr; Hmmer Software; Ibm Spss Statistics 25; Rnaprep Pure Plant Plus Kit; Transscript One-step Gdna Removal; Wgcna Package In R Version 4.4.1; Anthocyanins; Cell Culture; Factor Analysis; Transcription; Anthocyanin Accumulation; Epidermal Cells; Expression Patterns; Gene Expression Analysis; Lilium Leichtlinii; Molecular Mechanism; Myb Transcription Factors; Parenchymal Cells; Raised Spot; Transcriptome Analysis; Biochemistry; Anthocyanin; Basic Leucine Zipper Transcription Factor; Protein Myb; Transcription Factor; Transcriptome; Plant Protein; Article; Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy; Controlled Study; Drug Accumulation; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Lilium Leichtlinii; Lily; Network Analysis; Nonhuman; Phylogeny; Plant Leaf; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Region; Protein Expression; Raised Spot; Rna Extraction; Rna Isolation; Transcriptome Sequencing; Western Blotting; Yeast; Biosynthesis; Flower; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation; Genetics; Metabolism; Pigmentation; Basic-leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Flowers; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Lilium; Pigmentation; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Factors","Anthocyanins; Cell culture; Factor analysis; Transcription; Anthocyanin accumulation; Epidermal cells; Expression patterns; Gene expression analysis; Lilium leichtlinii; Molecular mechanism; MYB transcription factors; Parenchymal cells; Raised spot; Transcriptome analysis; Biochemistry; anthocyanin; basic leucine zipper transcription factor; protein Myb; transcription factor; transcriptome; plant protein; Article; confocal laser scanning microscopy; controlled study; drug accumulation; gene expression; gene ontology; lilium leichtlinii; lily; network analysis; nonhuman; phylogeny; plant leaf; polymerase chain reaction; promoter region; protein expression; raised spot; RNA extraction; RNA isolation; transcriptome sequencing; Western blotting; yeast; biosynthesis; flower; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; pigmentation; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; Flowers; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Lilium; Pigmentation; Plant Proteins; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Transcription Factors","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010845569"

To make ontologies useful, they must encompass a comprehensive domain view. To achieve ontology enrichment, there is a need to discover new concepts to be added, either because they were missed in the first place, or the state-of-the-art has advanced to develop new real-world concepts. Our goal is to develop an automatic enrichment pipeline using a seed ontology, a Large Language Model (LLM), and source of text. The pipeline is applied to the domain of Social Determinants of Health (SDoH), using PubMed as a source of concepts. In this work, the applicability and effectiveness of the enrichment pipeline is demonstrated by extending the SDoH Ontology called SOHOv1, however our methodology could be used in other domains as well. Methods: We first retrieved PubMed abstracts of candidate articles with existing SOHOv1 concepts as search terms. Next, we used GPT-4-1201 to extract semantic triples from the abstracts. We identified concepts from these triples utilizing lexical, semantic, and knowledge network-based filtering. We also compared the granularity of semantic triples extracted with our method to the triples in the SemMedDB (Semantic MEDLINE Database). The results were evaluated by human experts and standard ontology tools for checking consistency and semantic correctness. Results: We expanded SOHOv1, which contained 173 concepts and 585 axioms, including 207 logical axioms to SOHOv2, which contains 572 concepts, 1,542 axioms, including 725 logical axioms. Our methods identified more concepts than those extracted from SemMedDB for the same task. While we have shown the feasibility of our approach for an SDoH ontology, the methodology is generalizable to other ontologies with an existing seed ontology and text corpus. Conclusions: The contributions of this work are: Extracting semantic triples from PubMed abstracts using GPT-4-1201 utilizing prompt chaining; showing the superiority of triples from GPT-4-1201 over triples from SemMedDB for SDoH; using lexical and semantic similarity search techniques with knowledge network-based search to identify the concepts to be added to the ontology; confirming the quality of the new concepts with human experts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Model; Ontology Enrichment; Ontology Evaluation; Semantic Medline; Semantic Medline Database; Semmeddb Database; Similarity Search; Social Determinants Of Health; Abstracting; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Database Systems; Knowledge Based Systems; Knowledge Organization; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Search Engines; Semantic Web; Semantics; Language Model; Large Language Model; Medline Database; Ontology Enrichment; Ontology Evaluations; Semantic Medline; Semantic Medline Database; Semantic Medline Database Database; Similarity Search; Social Determinants Of Healths; Ontology; Academic Failure; Alcohol Consumption; Article; Built Environment; Community; Data Extraction; Depression; Economic Instability; Education; Generative Pretrained Transformer; Health Care Access; Health Care Disparity; High Risk Behavior; Human; Intermethod Comparison; Knowledge; Large Language Model; Natural Disaster; Neighborhood; Ontology; Ontology Development; Ontology Enrichment; Safety; Semantics; Social Aspect; Social Determinants Of Health; Biological Ontology; Language; Medline; Natural Language Processing; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Pubmed","Abstracting; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Database systems; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge organization; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Semantic Web; Semantics; Language model; Large language model; MEDLINE database; Ontology enrichment; Ontology evaluations; Semantic MEDLINE; Semantic MEDLINE database; Semantic MEDLINE database database; Similarity search; Social determinants of healths; Ontology; academic failure; alcohol consumption; Article; built environment; community; data extraction; depression; economic instability; education; generative pretrained transformer; health care access; health care disparity; high risk behavior; human; intermethod comparison; knowledge; large language model; natural disaster; neighborhood; ontology; ontology development; ontology enrichment; safety; semantics; social aspect; social determinants of health; biological ontology; language; Medline; natural language processing; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; PubMed","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009015837"

To do this, we use the popular principle of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). Graph traversal enriches the contextual knowledge, enabling more accurate and context-aware responses. An evaluation using an OWL example ontology and an extensive Q&A dataset demonstrates the improved retrieval quality achieved by combining classical and vector-based semantic matching methods.

This is demonstrated in detail in classical AI by the work of Simon, who explicitly connected his work on AI to a wider programme in cognitive science, economics, and politics to perfect capitalism. Although Dreyfus produced a powerful Heideggerian critique of classical AI, work on neural networks in AI was ultimately based on the individual as the locus of intelligence. Yet this conception of AI both fails to grasp the essence of large language models, which are a statistical model of human language on the Web. The training data that enables AI is the surveillance and capture of data, where the data creates a model to approximate the entire world. However, there is a more hidden ideology inherent in AI where the goal is not to perfect a model but to control the world. As prompted by an argument between Mead and Bateson, social change is prevented by the application of cybernetics to society as a whole. The goal of AI is not just to replace human beings, but to manage humans to preserve existing power relations. As the source of intelligence in AI is distributed cognition between humans and machines, the alternative to AI is collective intelligence. As theorized by Licklider and Engelbart at the dawn of the Internet, collective intelligence explains how computers weave together both human and non-human intelligence. Rather than replace human intelligence, this produces ever more complex collective forms of intelligence. Rather than meta-stabilize a society of control, collective intelligence can go outside individualist capitalist ontology by incorporating the open world of the pluriverse, as theorized by Escobar. Collective intelligence then stands as an alternative ontological path for AI which puts intelligence at the service of humanity and the world rather than a technocratic elite. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Collective Intelligence; Cybernetics; Individualism; Economic And Social Effects; Neural Networks; Cognitive Science; Collective Intelligences; Human Intelligence; Human Language; Human Subjects; Individualism; Language Model; Neural-networks; Statistic Modeling; Training Data; Ontology","Economic and social effects; Neural networks; Cognitive science; Collective intelligences; Human intelligence; Human language; Human subjects; Individualism; Language model; Neural-networks; Statistic modeling; Training data; Ontology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000281882"

Traditional information retrieval methods struggle to meet the advanced demands of semantic understanding and knowledge reasoning in mineral exploration. To enhance geological knowledge service efficiency, this study develops an intelligent question-answering system for the Jiaodong gold deposit domain based on GraphRAG (Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology. The research utilizes academic papers from CNKI as the corpus, employs OCR and large language models (LLMs) for text parsing and semantic standardization to establish an ontological knowledge system covering core concepts such as mineralization types, ore-controlling structures, and mineral assemblages. The system uses prompt engineering-driven LLMs to automatically extract entities and relationships, constructing a structured knowledge graph integrated into Neo4j. Furthermore, by combining semantic embedding with community clustering algorithms, a knowledge indexing network enables natural language question answering, semantic query expansion, and knowledge provenance. Evaluation results demonstrate the system’s superiority over traditional RAG and general models (e.g., ChatGPT-4o) in answer accuracy, contextual precision, and knowledge interpretability, exhibiting enhanced professional adaptability and reasoning capabilities.

The proposed article provides a novel approach by applying pre-trained language models to automatically construct the ontology. The framework consists of two sequential phases: automatic concept discovery and automatic relation discovery. In the context of automatic concept discovery, instances and their embedding vectors are extracted first through Named Entity Recognition (NER). Then, the unsupervised affinity propagation (AP) clustering algorithm is applied to classify these embedding vectors, resulting in the discovery of the concepts. A denoising method is discussed to obtain higher accuracy with respect to the concepts obtained to reduce noise caused by complete clustering. Related to automatic relation discovery between concepts (mentioned in the next section), the process generates inexplicable concepts that are contextually similar based on the embedded vectors of instances mapping over the two entities. This can enable unsupervised automatic discovery of relations between the contextually related concepts. This method shows a certain feasibility and achieves early effectiveness in unsupervised automatic ontology construction with the experimental results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Affinity Propagation; Automatic Ontology Construction; Knowledge Graph; Pre-trained Language Model; Clustering Algorithms; Data Mining; Embeddings; Knowledge Graph; Affinity Propagation; Automatic Ontology; Automatic Ontology Construction; Concept Discoveries; Construction Method; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Ontology Construction; Pre-trained Language Model; Ontology","Clustering algorithms; Data mining; Embeddings; Knowledge graph; Affinity propagation; Automatic ontology; Automatic ontology construction; Concept discoveries; Construction method; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Ontology construction; Pre-trained language model; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013077743"

Patent matching is a crucial task in intellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and utilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents directly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and overlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of patents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent matching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from their parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their memory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing these entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph, we utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM in comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the PatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a 17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis highlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both in-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning processes of LLMs during patent matching.

Existing research primarily employs advanced graph neural networks and sequential algorithms for patient modeling, with a focus on discerning the connections and sequential patterns inherent in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the heterogeneity of entity interactions, the locality of EHR data, and the oversight of target relevance hinder further improvements. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework Beyond Sequential Patterns (BSP), which facilitates precise healthcare predictions by incorporating tri-contextual information. Specifically, we establish a symptom-driven hypergraph network with four semantic hyperedges tailored to the intricacies of the healthcare scenario, such as ontology. This serves as a global context, tracking the heterogeneous entity collaboration within and across patients. Moreover, we construct an extensive knowledge graph leveraging existing medical databases and large language models. By sampling and refining knowledge subgraphs as local context, we bolster the semantic associations of medical entities from closed-set EHR data to the open world. Finally, we introduce the candidate context, an explicit entity-relation loss. It enforces the neighbor consistency between the target and the representation during optimization, thus accounting for correlations among targets. Extensive experiments and rigorous robustness analysis on five tasks derived from four large medical datasets underscore the BSP's superiority over the leading baselines, with improvements of 11%, 3%, 11%, 3.5%, and 2% across five tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of incorporating diverse contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Healthcare Prediction; Hypergraph Learning; Large Language Model; Electronic Health Record; Health Care; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Medical Computing; Medical Informatics; Semantics; Electronic Health; Health Outcomes; Health Records; Healthcare Prediction; Hyper Graph; Hypergraph Learning; Language Model; Large Language Model; Sequential Patterns; Well Being; Forecasting","Electronic health record; Health care; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Medical computing; Medical informatics; Semantics; Electronic health; Health outcomes; Health records; Healthcare prediction; Hyper graph; Hypergraph learning; Language model; Large language model; Sequential patterns; Well being; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011390504"

Firstly, a multi-stage hierarchical ontology model across time and space is designed based on an analysis of characteristics of quality texts in the nuclear power equipment value chain. Secondly, an improved few-shot-learning-based entity recognition model and a relative position-based entity relationship matching method are proposed, and then knowledge triples are extracted to construct the knowledge graph. Thirdly, through comprehensive scenario analysis and expert interviews, a set of question-and-answer templates for user interaction with the knowledge graph is designed, a frame based on Retrieval Augmented Generation is defined, and an application for questions and answers aiming at collaborative quality control in the nuclear power equipment value chain is developed. Finally, the effectiveness and superiority of the above methods are validated by comparing with the large language models ChatGPT and keyword matching model. The improved entity recognition model demonstrates better performance in handling smaller quality texts.

RAG is a highly dynamic scenario, where the LLM agent might not only retrieve information from a KG or vector store but mutate it as well. This implies eventually there being a greater demand for equally-dynamic KG reasoning systems. We provide a solution to this for the popular ontology language RDF-Schema (RDFS) by showing that computing entailment as a bottom-up query over RDFS graphs with dynamic Terminological Boxes (TBox) and Assertional Boxes (ABox), those where edges and nodes belonging to both boxes can be freely added and removed, can be expressed as an incremental DBSP computation.

Although biochemical experiments are the gold standard for determining protein functions, they are often time-consuming and labor-intensive. Here, we proposed a novel composite deep-learning method, Multi-source Knowledge Fusion for Gene Ontology prediction (MKFGO), to infer Gene Ontology (GO) attributes through integrating five complementary pipelines built on multi-source biological data. MKFGO was rigorously benchmarked on 1522 nonredundant proteins, demonstrating superior performance over 12 state-of-the-art function prediction methods. Comprehensive data analyses revealed that the major advantage of MKFGO lies in its two deep-learning components, handcrafted feature representation–based GO prediction (HFRGO) and protein large language model (PLM)–based GO prediction (PLMGO), which derive handcrafted features and PLM–based features, respectively, from protein sequences in different biological views, with effective knowledge fusion at the decision-level. HFRGO leverages a long short-term memory (LSTM)–attention network embedded with handcrafted features, in which the triplet loss–based guilt-by-association strategy is designed to enhance the correlation between feature similarity and function similarity. PLMGO employs the PLM to capture feature embeddings with discriminative functional patterns from sequences. Meanwhile, another three components provide complementary insights for further improving prediction accuracy, driven by protein–protein interaction, GO term probability, and protein-coding gene sequence, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Lstm-attention Network; Multi-source Knowledge Fusion; Pretrained Language Model; Protein Function; Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Attention Network; Controlled Study; Data Analysis; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Gene Ontology; Gene Sequence; Guilt; Language Model; Large Language Model; Long Short Term Memory Network; Prediction; Probability; Protein Function; Protein Protein Interaction; Bioinformatics; Chemistry; Genetics; Human; Metabolism; Procedures; Protein Database; Software; Protein; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Deep Learning; Gene Ontology; Humans; Proteins; Software","amino acid sequence; article; attention network; controlled study; data analysis; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; gene ontology; gene sequence; guilt; language model; large language model; long short term memory network; prediction; probability; protein function; protein protein interaction; bioinformatics; chemistry; genetics; human; metabolism; procedures; protein database; software; protein; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Deep Learning; Gene Ontology; Humans; Proteins; Software","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013381854"

Recent advances in high-throughput technologies and the explosion of biomedical data have highlighted the potential of computational druggability prediction methods. However, most current methods rely on sequence-based features with machine learning, which often face challenges related to hand-crafted features, reproducibility, and accessibility. Moreover, the potential of raw sequence and protein structure has not been fully investigated. Results Here, we leveraged both protein sequence and structure using deep learning techniques, revealing that protein sequence, especially pre-trained embeddings, is more informative than protein structure. Next, we developed DrugTar, a high-performance deep learning algorithm integrating sequence embeddings from the ESM-2 pre-trained protein language model with gene ontologies to predict druggability. DrugTar achieved areas under the curve and precision-recall curve values of 0.94, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. In conclusion, DrugTar streamlines target discovery as a bottleneck in developing novel therapeutics. Availability and implementation DrugTar is available as a web server at www.DrugTar.com.

Yet the great diversity of species and the cloudy, rainy, mountainous environment characteristics of these regions complicate multi-source remote-sensing features, hindering clear spatio-temporal expression of both basic and composite (state and process) tree-species characteristics. Inspired by geographic knowledge mapping, this study integrated tree-species fundamentals, geomorphological patterns, and multi-source remote-sensing feature knowledge. It proposes a framework for constructing a spatio-temporal remote-sensing knowledge graph for typical subtropical tree species, and by incorporating the DeepSeek large language model (LLM), develops an intelligent Q&A system organizing and expressing tree-species remote-sensing knowledge more effectively. [Method] To achieve the above objectives, the study first organized and integrated the basic concepts of tree species, geographic-law knowledge, and remote-sensing interpretation information at three levels: data knowledge, conceptual knowledge, and rule knowledge to build a comprehensive system describing the spatial distribution, temporal dynamics, and geographic context of subtropical tree species. Taking forest class as the interpretation unit, ontology modelling was used to build tree-species ontology knowledge and remote-sensing ontology knowledge for individual temporal states. Temporal and spatial correlations reflecting tree-growth evolution were then introduced to form a spatio-temporal sequence ontology model and to extract relationships among core elements of remote-sensing knowledge for typical subtropical tree species. In addition, forest-inventory data, Baidu Encyclopaedia entries, and remote-sensing pre-interpretation results were fused to enrich the data layer with ontology and attribute information. Finally, entity relationships were stored in a Neo4j graph database to construct the spatio-temporal remote-sensing knowledge graph, while the DeepSeek LLM deployed a local knowledge base to enable knowledge-graph-driven interactive Q&A services. [Result] The study successfully constructed a spatio-temporal remote-sensing knowledge graph for typical subtropical tree species, and through deep integration with DeepSeek, developed an intelligent Q&A system supporting natural-language interaction. The system enables associated queries and map-based visualisation of tree-species knowledge, geomorphological knowledge, and remote-sensing knowledge across different states. [Conclusion] The proposed approach realises the transformation from “data to knowledge” for subtropical tree species and through the synergistic computing of DeepSeek and the knowledge graph, offers flexible, convenient remote-sensing knowledge queries and services. It supplies data support for knowledge-guided, intelligent remote-sensing interpretation of typical subtropical tree species and provides a demonstrative application for remote-sensing knowledge mapping in other domains. Future work will expand the scale of the knowledge graph to meet the demand for high-quality knowledge services in high-precision forestry remote-sensing monitoring. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Service; Multi-source Remote Sensing Data; Spatiotemporal Characteristics; Subtropical Area; Tree Species","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012123570"

Importing the high-throughput neural-network-based prediction framework to replace the low-throughput biological experiments, a universal multi-modal method is straightforward in addressing the growing gap between known sequences and predicting functions. Results: To bridge the gap, we propose ProtGO, a three-step framework for predicting protein function, which leverages the credible Gene Ontology (GO) knowledge base and integrates four common modalities. Specifically, we first introduce frontier pre-trained protein language models (PLMs) for representation learning of mainstay functional protein sequences. For the remaining multi-modal data, we design a text alignment module for explainable text descriptions, a taxonomy encoding module for species-specific taxonomy, and a GO graph embedding module for biological GO relations. Each module is independent and adaptive for the referenced modalities. By harnessing these four knowledge representations, ProtGO maximizes the potential of GO resources, enhancing the performance of vanilla PLMs and biological language models (LMs) in downstream GO prediction tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ProtGO significantly advances the abilities of state-of-the-art PLMs to predict protein functions: approximately 8% to 27% increase in the maximum F1 measure (Fmax) compared to base models. These comprehensive studies confirm ProtGO's capability to deliver outstanding performance in protein function prediction by utilizing a rich blend of functional and evolutionary knowledge.

This study presents a methodology for ontology construction supported by large language models (LLMs), with an initial application in the automotive sector. Specifically, a user preference ontology for adaptive interfaces in autonomous machines was developed using ChatGPT-4o. Based on this case study, the results were generalized into a reusable methodology. The proposed workflow integrates classical ontology engineering methodologies with the generative and analytical capabilities of LLMs. Each phase follows well-established steps: domain definition, term elicitation, class hierarchy construction, property specification, formalization, population, and validation. A key innovation of this approach is the use of a guiding table that translates domain knowledge into structured prompts, ensuring consistency across iterative interactions with the LLM. Human experts play a continuous role throughout the process, refining definitions, resolving ambiguities, and validating outputs. The ontology was evaluated in terms of logical consistency, structural properties, semantic accuracy, and inferential completeness, confirming its correctness and coherence. Additional validation through SPARQL queries demonstrated its reasoning capabilities. This methodology is generalizable to other domains, if domain experts adapt the guiding table to the specific context.

Retrospective data harmonization is often used to integrate existing datasets to create these samples, but the process is labor-intensive. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can accelerate this process, particularly when harmonizing datasets with numerous variables and varied naming conventions. Research in this area has been limited, primarily focusing on lexical matching and ontology-based semantic matching. We aimed to develop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLMs) and ensemble learning, to automate variable matching. Methods This study utilized data from two GERAS cohort studies (European [EU] and Japan [JP]) obtained through the Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) Data Initiative’s AD workbench. We first manually created a dataset by matching 347 EU variables with 1322 candidate JP variables and treated matched variable pairs as positive instances and unmatched pairs as negative instances. We then developed four natural language processing (NLP) methods using state-of-the-art LLMs (E5, MPNet, MiniLM, and BioLORD-2023) to estimate variable similarity based on variable labels and derivation rules. A lexical matching method using fuzzy matching was included as a baseline model. In addition, we developed an ensemble-learning method, using the Random Forest (RF) model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF was trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of training and test sets, with the model’s hyperparameters optimized through cross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP variables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF’s probability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking performance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HR-n) and mean reciprocal rank (MRR). Results E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.898 HR-30 and 0.700 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P<0.001) and achieved an average HR-30 of 0.986 and MRR of 0.744. LLM-derived features contributed most to RF’s performance. One major cause of errors in automatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions. Conclusion NLP techniques (especially LLMs), combined with ensemble learning, hold great potential in automating variable matching and accelerating biomedical data harmonization. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alzheimer Disease; Anthropometry; Article; Benchmarking; Bioinformatics; Biomedical Engineering; Body Mass; Classifier; Cognition; Cohort Analysis; Cross Validation; Daily Life Activity; Demographics; Feature Extraction; Female; Human; Hypertension; Large Language Model; Lexical Matching Method; Male; Mini Mental State Examination; Natural Language Processing; Ontology; Probability; Protein Misfolding; Questionnaire; Random Forest; Retrospective Study; Semantics; Japan; Language; Medical Research; Alzheimer Disease; Biomedical Research; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Semantics","Alzheimer disease; anthropometry; Article; benchmarking; bioinformatics; biomedical engineering; body mass; classifier; cognition; cohort analysis; cross validation; daily life activity; demographics; feature extraction; female; human; hypertension; large language model; lexical matching method; male; Mini Mental State Examination; natural language processing; ontology; probability; protein misfolding; questionnaire; random forest; retrospective study; semantics; Japan; language; medical research; Alzheimer Disease; Biomedical Research; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011525696"

The topic is justified by the need to understand the prompt as a mediating space between human intentionality, language, and the sociopolitical structures that shape interactions with these technologies. The central objective is to examine how prompting reflects ethical, ontological, and epistemological tensions that arise in the construction of meaning within AI systems. Methodologically, the study adopts a critical-phenomenological approach, combining first-person experiences (user) with practical experimentation of prompts in different scenarios. The results demonstrate that the prompt is not merely a technical instruction but a discursive practice, where human decisions, such as the configuration of “parameters” (e. g., temperature and Top P), directly influence the outputs generated by AI systems. While these decisions appear technical, they carry significant ethical and epistemological implications that demand critical examination.

However, with the widespread adoption of high-throughput sequencing technologies, the pace of protein function annotation significantly lags behind that of sequence discovery, highlighting the urgent need for more efficient and reliable predictive methods. To address the problem of existing methods ignoring the hierarchical structure of gene ontology terms and making it challenging to dynamically associate protein features with functional contexts, we propose a novel protein function prediction framework, termed Partial Order-Based Self-Attention for Gene Ontology (POSA-GO). This cross-modal collaborative modelling approach fuses GO terms with protein sequences. The model leverages the pre-trained language model ESM-2 to extract deep semantic features from protein sequences. Meanwhile, it transforms the partial order relationships among Gene Ontology (GO) terms into topological embeddings to capture their biological hierarchical dependencies. Furthermore, a multi-head self-attention mechanism is employed to dynamically model the association weights between proteins and GO terms, thereby enabling context-aware functional annotation. Comparative experiments on the CAFA3 and SwissProt datasets demonstrate that POSA-GO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of Fmax and AUPR metrics, offering a promising solution for protein functional studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Multiple Self-attention Mechanisms; Protein Function Prediction; Protein Language Model; Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Benchmarking; Controlled Study; Etiology; Gene Ontology; High Throughput Sequencing; Human; Language Model; Prediction; Protein Function; Protein Language Model; Swiss-prot; Bioinformatics; Chemistry; Genetics; Metabolism; Molecular Genetics; Procedures; Protein Database; Semantics; Protein; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins; Semantics","amino acid sequence; article; benchmarking; controlled study; etiology; gene ontology; high throughput sequencing; human; language model; prediction; protein function; protein language model; SWISS-PROT; bioinformatics; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; procedures; protein database; semantics; protein; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010308057"

While it has democratized access to knowledge, it has also led to an increase in fake news, with significant societal repercussions. The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated this issue, resulting in what the World Health Organization has termed an “infodemic."" In light of this, developing effective methods for detecting fake news is of paramount importance. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that integrates knowledge graphs and Named Entity Recognition (NER) based on a biomedical language model to address the challenge of fake news detection. Our method aims to enhance detection accuracy by combining content analysis with entity-level insights. Our approach involves three key components. First, content analysis uses a contextual language model to capture the semantic context of the content, enabling the extraction of meaningful insights essential for identifying fake news. Second, the NER component, built on a biomedical language model, precisely identifies and categorizes entities within the content, offering a deeper understanding crucial for detecting misinformation in the biomedical domain. Finally, entity integration employs knowledge graph embeddings to transform identified entities into a format that facilitates enhanced processing and detection. By blending these components, our method creates a unified representation of the content, incorporating both semantic context and entity-based insights. This comprehensive approach significantly improves the accuracy of fake news detection. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this method, particularly in the early identification of false information. The results underscore the potential of our approach as a powerful tool in combating misinformation, particularly in critical areas such as public health. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Nvidia Ai Server; Accuracy; Article; Content Analysis; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Coronavirus Disease 2019; Disease Exacerbation; Disinformation; Electric Potential; Embedding; Encoding; Evidence Based Practice; Feature Extraction; Graph Attention Network; Graph Convolutional Network; Graphsage; Human; Immunization; Infodemic; Information; Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; Language Model; Long Short Term Memory Network; Mass Communication; Misinformation; Multilayer Perceptron; Natural Language Processing; Ontology; Open Access Publishing; Predictive Model; Public Health; Recurrent Neural Network; Semantics; Social Media; Training; World Health Organization; Deception; Epidemiology; Isolation And Purification; Pandemic; Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2; Covid-19; Deception; Humans; Pandemics; Sars-cov-2; Semantics","accuracy; Article; content analysis; controlled study; convolutional neural network; coronavirus disease 2019; disease exacerbation; disinformation; electric potential; embedding; encoding; evidence based practice; feature extraction; Graph Attention Network; Graph Convolutional Network; GraphSAGE; human; immunization; infodemic; information; knowledge; knowledge graph; language model; long short term memory network; mass communication; misinformation; multilayer perceptron; natural language processing; ontology; open access publishing; predictive model; public health; recurrent neural network; semantics; social media; training; World Health Organization; deception; epidemiology; isolation and purification; pandemic; Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2; COVID-19; Deception; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009646134"

[Method/ Process] Firstly, the domain knowledge graph was constructed through steps such as lightweight ontology construction, BRAT knowledge annotation, and Neo4j knowledge storage. Next, the large language model ChatGLM2-6B was locally deployed and fine tuned through LoRA technology. Finally, based on the MOT mechanism, the knowledge in the knowledge graph was injected into the prompts, and complex knowledge objects were extracted from scientific literature through multiple rounds of Q&A with the large language model. [Result/ Conclusion] Taking organic solar cells(OSCs) as an example to verify the effectiveness of the method, the results show that the extraction method intergrating knowledge graph and large language model is superior to the extraction method supported by large language model alone, with improvements of 14. 1%, 10. 3%, and 12. 3% in accuracy P, recall R, and F1 score, respectively.

Despite the existence of numerous methods for predicting promoters, they are typically built on single-sequence information and seldom incorporate external knowledge graphs (KGs). Knowledge graphs, however, can provide rich factual knowledge that enhances the accuracy of promoter identification. In this study, we propose a novel method called OntoGene, which integrates Gene Ontology (GO) into the bidirectional encoder representations from transformers model (BERT) for promoter identification. Specifically, OntoGene encodes both gene sequences and external knowledge into vectors using a BERT encoder. Our method jointly optimizes knowledge embedding and masked language modeling objectives, and utilizes a contrastive learning method with knowledge-aware negative sampling to optimize gene and knowledge graph embeddings. OntoGene is a BERT-based model designed to predict not only the presence of promoters but also their strength (strong or weak promoters) from gene sequences. Experimental results demonstrate OntoGene’s high accuracy in predicting DNA promoters and their strengths, validating the effectiveness of this knowledge-enhanced approach.

However, traditional hydraulic structure safety management methods rely on error-prone individual experience and emergency manuals, which are insufficient for making timely, scientifically informed decisions during crises. To address this challenge, this study presents an AI-driven framework for hydraulic structure safety management based on knowledge-based question answering. First, an ontology model was developed through a detailed analysis of safety management texts. Next, a partition fusion Kolmogorov-arnold network (PFKAN) enhanced with attention mechanisms was designed to jointly extract entities and relational knowledge. A safety management knowledge graph (KG) was then constructed from this knowledge. Subsequently, a large language model (LLM) was employed with a voting strategy to interpret query intent and extract relevant domain-specific knowledge from the KG. Finally, domain knowledge was integrated into the LLM to generate professional responses. Experimental results show that the F1 scores for entity and relation extraction with PFKAN reached 0.91 and 0.90, respectively, and the F1 score for query intent parsing with the voting strategy was 0.95, demonstrating competitive performance. The KG-enhanced LLM significantly improves decision-making in hydraulic structure safety management, providing an accurate and scalable tool for engineering safety managers. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain Knowledge Qa; Hydraulic Structure Safety Management; Intent Parsing; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Health Hazards; Inference Engines; Knowledge Acquisition; Risk Management; Risk Perception; Domain Knowledge; Domain Knowledge Qa; Hydraulic Structure Safety Management; Intent Parsing; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Question Answering; Safety Management; Structure Safety; Knowledge Graph","Health hazards; Inference engines; Knowledge acquisition; Risk management; Risk perception; Domain knowledge; Domain knowledge QA; Hydraulic structure safety management; Intent parsing; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Question Answering; Safety management; Structure safety; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005395178"

Except for a small number of model organisms, most species contain many proteins whose functions have not been experimentally verified, necessitating the development of accurate, automated protein function annotation methods. Recent progress in protein bioinformatics, particularly in predicting protein structures and functions, has been driven significantly by the application of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, with a notable emphasis on deep learning models. For instance, the top-ranked methods in recent Critical Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge have used deep learning models, primarily large language models, to perform text mining-based protein function annotation. These methods either predict Gene Ontology (GO) terms directly from text features extracted from scientific literatures or from template proteins with databases. Despite the extensive work in developing increasingly powerful deep learning models for text mining-based protein function annotation, several major challenges have been overlooked when parsing scientific literature data. This manuscript reviews existing methods and challenges in protein function annotation. First, many text mining-based protein function predictors rely exclusively on PubMed abstracts collected by UniProt curators for the query protein, ignoring literatures that have not been reviewed by biocurators. Consequently, protein functions predicted by text mining might overlap with those from manual curation of the UniProt Gene Ontology Annotation. Second, nearly all methods only parse PubMed abstracts, ignoring the more informative full-text documents often available in the PubMed Central and Europe PMC repositories. Third, few studies have been proposed to automatically differentiate between different categories of literatures, such as low and high throughput experiments, and computational predictions. This manuscript also proposes promising approaches to enhance text mining-based protein function annotation using the latest development in AI, which is expected to contribute to the development of next-generation text mining tools for more accurate function annotation.[Figure Presented] © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biological Functions; Deep Learning; Gene Ontology (go) Terms; Proteins; Text Mining","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012889829"

In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large-scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi-agent systems with in-situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up-to-date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a “swarm of intelligence” similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy-efficient production is shown. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bio-inspired Materials; Biological Design; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Materials Design; Multi-agent System; Natural Language Processing; Scientific Ai; Bio-inspired Materials; Biological Design; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Materials Design; Multiagent Systems (mass); Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Scientific Artificial Intelligence; Knowledge Graph; Artificial Intelligence; Human; Artificial Intelligence; Humans","Bio-inspired materials; Biological design; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Materials design; Multiagent systems (MASs); Natural language processing; Natural languages; Scientific artificial intelligence; Knowledge graph; artificial intelligence; human; Artificial Intelligence; Humans","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212471317"

We show that the concept of language that Heidegger, Freud and Lacan discuss and utilize in clinical frameworks is matched quite strongly by modern LLMs. This allows us to discuss a problem of negation and negativity that is central to the continental discourse but missing in current LLM research. This also means that we offer a radically different approach than is usual in the philosophy of artificial intelligence, since we base our concepts on thinkers that are often disregarded in the analytic philosophy discourse that is closer linked to AI research.

It has brought different machines, tools, robots and devices together through integration with cyber-physical systems as well as Internet of Things and computer systems. This has dramatically improved efficiency, productivity, and flexibility of automated systems, but it has also raised concerns about the impact of automation on jobs, the ethical considerations and the future of work in general. Industry 5.0 (I5.0) is the next manufacturing paradigm evolution and builds on I4.0 with the addition of ‘people’, in which robots will be designed to work alongside humans in a safe and efficient manner. Human-robot collaboration (HRC) is its key enabler. In manufacturing, HRC has the potential to improve safety, efficiency, and productivity by allowing humans to focus on tasks that require creativity, judgment, and flexibility, while robots perform more repetitive and dangerous tasks. This paper explores the concept of HRC and its advancement within 21st century industry. It identifies the opportunities and challenges arising from the interactions between robots and humans in manufacturing applications, assembly, and inspection. It also highlights the significance of HRC in I4.0 and its potential in I5.0. In addition, the role of artificial intelligence, machine learning, large language models, information modelling (ontologies) and new emerging digital technologies (augmented reality, virtual reality, digital twins, cyber-physical system) in the development of HRC and I5.0 is documented and discussed adding new perspectives to the growing literature in this area. This investigation sheds light on the emerging paradigms that have come about as parts of I5.0 and the transformative role of human-robot interaction in shaping the future of manufacturing. This critical review provides a realistic picture of manufacturing automation and the benefits and weaknesses of current HRC systems. It presents a researched view on the concept, needs, enabling technologies and system frameworks of human-robot interaction in manufacturing, providing a practical vision and research agenda for future work in this area and its associated systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Digital Manufacturing; Human Robot Collaboration; Industry 5.0; Ontology; Augmented Reality; Computer Aided Manufacturing; Human Robot Interaction; Industrial Robots; Ontology; Robot Learning; Virtual Environments; Automated Systems; Cybe-physical Systems; Cyber-physical Systems; Digital Manufacturing; Human-robot Collaboration; Humans-robot Interactions; Industry 5.0; Manufacturing Challenges; Manufacturing Opportunities; Ontology's; Smart Manufacturing","Augmented reality; Computer aided manufacturing; Human robot interaction; Industrial robots; Ontology; Robot learning; Virtual environments; Automated systems; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Digital manufacturing; Human-robot collaboration; Humans-robot interactions; Industry 5.0; Manufacturing challenges; Manufacturing opportunities; Ontology's; Smart manufacturing","Review","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214277411"

Current research primarily focuses on new methods of privacy invasion brought about by large language models and their countermeasures, yet there is scarce attention to the more fundamental issue of the generative informational privacy gap. This gap refers to the discrepancy between the “ought” and the “is” of individual informational privacy, exacerbated by the predictive analytical capabilities and generative functions of multi - modal large language models. These technologies enhance the privacy awareness and manipulation power of both human and machine agents, resulting in individuals facing a widening disparity in their level of informational privacy. This concept helps to more intuitively reveal the “entanglement” between AI technology, privacy owners, and privacy itself. The generative informational privacy gap may lead to ontological privacy alienation, epistemological cognitive reification, and praxeological behavior domestication. The key to addressing these issues lies in two main strategies: Firstly, achieving three major paradigm shifts in regulation; Secondly, a tripartite governance approach that simultaneously employs heteronomy, technonomy, and autonomy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generative Informational Privacy Gap; Informational Privacy Gap; Predictive Informational Privacy Gap","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010899246"

These inconsistencies hinder their direct use in patient care and degrade the performance of downstream computational applications that rely on these notes as input, such as quality improvement, population health analytics, precision medicine, clinical decision support, and research. We present a large-language-model (LLM) approach to the preprocessing of 1618 neurology notes. The LLM corrected spelling and grammatical errors, expanded acronyms, and standardized terminology and formatting, without altering clinical content. Expert review of randomly sampled notes confirmed that no significant information was lost. To evaluate downstream impact, we applied an ontology-based NLP pipeline (Doc2Hpo) to extract biomedical concepts from the notes before and after editing. F1 scores for Human Phenotype Ontology extraction improved from 0.40 to 0.61, confirming our hypothesis that better inputs yielded better outputs. We conclude that LLM-based preprocessing is an effective error correction strategy that improves data quality at the level of free text in clinical notes.

The assessment included 367 generic-to-brand and 2,516 brand-to-generic pairs, 1,000 drug-drug interaction (DDI) synthetic patient cases, and 2,438 immune-related adverse event (irAE) cases. LLMs were tested on drug name recognition, word association, DDI (DDI) detection, and irAE diagnosis using both brand and generic drug names.RESULTSLLMs demonstrated high accuracy in matching brand and generic names (GPT-4o: 97.38% for brand, 94.71% for generic, P <.01). However, they showed significant inconsistencies in word association tasks. GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 exhibited biases favoring brand names for effectiveness (odds ratio [OR], 1.43, P <.05) and being side-effect-free (OR, 1.76, P <.05). DDI detection accuracy was poor across all models (<26%), with no significant differences between brand and generic names. Sentiment analysis revealed significant differences, particularly in GPT-3.5-turbo-0125 (brand mean 0.67, generic mean 0.95, P <.01). Consistency in irAE diagnosis varied across models.CONCLUSIONDespite high proficiency in name-matching, LLMs exhibit inconsistencies when processing brand versus generic drug names in more complex tasks. These findings highlight the need for increased awareness, improved robustness assessment methods, and the development of more consistent systems for handling nomenclature variations in clinical applications of LLMs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Antineoplastic Agents; Drugs, Generic; Antineoplastic Agent; Generic Drug; Accuracy; Article; Clinical Practice; Differential Diagnosis; Drug Interaction; Human; Large Language Model; Multiple Choice Test; Sentiment Analysis; Temperature; Classification; Drug Therapy; Language; Neoplasm; Nomenclature; Reproducibility; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Interactions; Drugs, Generic; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Neoplasms; Reproducibility Of Results; Terminology As Topic","antineoplastic agent; generic drug; accuracy; Article; clinical practice; differential diagnosis; drug interaction; human; large language model; multiple choice test; sentiment analysis; temperature; classification; drug therapy; language; neoplasm; nomenclature; reproducibility; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Interactions; Drugs, Generic; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Neoplasms; Reproducibility of Results; Terminology as Topic","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008823467"

This study compared the performance of a rule-based NLP system and a medical-domain transformer-based model to detect negated concepts in radiology reports. Using a corpus of 984 de-identified radiology reports from a large U.S.-based academic health system (1000 consecutive reports, excluding 16 duplicates), the investigators compared the rule-based medspaCy system and the Clinical Assertion and Negation Classification Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (CAN-BERT) system to detect negated expressions of terms from RadLex, the Unified Medical Language System Metathesaurus, and the Radiology Gamuts Ontology. Power analysis determined a sample size of 382 terms to achieve α = 0.05 and β = 0.8 for McNemar’s test; based on an estimate of 15% negated terms, 2800 randomly selected terms were annotated manually as negated or not negated. Precision, recall, and F1 of the two models were compared using McNemar’s test. Of the 2800 terms, 387 (13.8%) were negated. For negation detection, medspaCy attained a recall of 0.795, precision of 0.356, and F1 of 0.492. CAN-BERT achieved a recall of 0.785, precision of 0.768, and F1 of 0.777. Although recall was not significantly different, CAN-BERT had significantly better precision (χ2 = 304.64; p < 0.001). The transformer-based CAN-BERT model detected negated terms in radiology reports with high precision and recall; its precision significantly exceeded that of the rule-based medspaCy system. Use of this system will improve data extraction from textual reports to support information retrieval, AI model training, and discovery of causal relationships. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Negated Expression (negex) Detection; Radiology Reports; Artificial Intelligence; Behavioral Research; Computational Linguistics; Decision Making; Extraction; Information Retrieval; Information Use; Medical Information Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Radiology; Text Processing; Expression Detections; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Negated Expression Detection; Radiology Reports; Rule Based; Clinical Research; Aged; Article; Assertiveness; Clinical Decision Making; Data Extraction; Diagnosis; Human; Information Retrieval; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Power Analysis; Radiology; Sample Size; Total Quality Management; Unified Medical Language System","Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Computational linguistics; Decision making; Extraction; Information retrieval; Information use; Medical information systems; Natural language processing systems; Radiology; Text processing; Expression detections; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Negated expression detection; Radiology reports; Rule based; Clinical research; aged; article; assertiveness; clinical decision making; data extraction; diagnosis; human; information retrieval; large language model; natural language processing; power analysis; radiology; sample size; total quality management; Unified Medical Language System","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008273555"

Our methodology involved leveraging ChatGPT-4 to extract data from the GBIF Backbone API and generate OWL files for further integration in APTO. Two alternative approaches were explored: (1) issuing a series of prompts for ChatGPT-4 to execute tasks via the BrowserOP plugin and (2) directing ChatGPT-4 to design a Python algorithm to perform analogous tasks. Both approaches rely on a prompting method where we provide instructions, context, input data, and an output indicator. The first approach showed scalability limitations, while the second approach used the Python algorithm to overcome these challenges, but it struggled with typographical errors in data handling.

The results show that: i) the template-based structured ontology approach achieved a BERT Precision of 0.833, Recall of 0.844, and F1-score of 0.838, with a Semantic Similarity of 0.563, ii) the LLM-based structured ontology method showed improvements with a BERT Precision of 0.856, Recall of 0.863, and F1-score of 0.859, but a lower Semantic Similarity of 0.534, and iii) the LLM-based flat concept list approach provided the best results, achieving BERT Precision, Recall, and F1-score of 0.859, along with the highest Semantic Similarity of 0.567.

However, the advent of alternative protein representations, including embeddings from protein language models (PLMs) and predicted structures from AlphaFold, raises the possibility that alternative similarity metrics could better capture functional similarity between paralogs. Here, using two species (budding yeast and human) and two different definitions of shared functionality (shared protein–protein interactions and synthetic lethality), we evaluated a variety of alternative similarity metrics. For some tasks, predicted structural similarity or PLM similarity outperform sequence identity, but more importantly these similarity metrics are not redundant with sequence identity, i.e. combining them with sequence identity leads to improved predictions of shared functionality. By adding contextual features, representing similarity to homologous proteins within and across species, we can significantly enhance our predictions of shared paralog functionality. Overall, our results suggest that alternative similarity metrics capture complementary aspects of functional similarity beyond sequence identity alone. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Embryo; Evaluation Study; Gene Function; Gene Interaction; Gene Ontology; Genetic Distance; Human; Human Cell; Nonhuman; Paralogy; Protein Language Model; Protein Protein Interaction; Protein Structure; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Synthetic Lethality","amino acid sequence; Article; embryo; evaluation study; gene function; gene interaction; gene ontology; genetic distance; human; human cell; nonhuman; paralogy; protein language model; protein protein interaction; protein structure; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; synthetic lethality","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003866563"

It explains how over the years, his mapping techniques evolved from journal mapping to global maps of science and finally towards interactive interfaces portraying multiple classifications and ontologies. It then critically reviews the challenges faced by current approaches to science mapping, which implicitly assume a ‘natural’ epistemic structure, with examples from two recent case studies. We observe that bottom-up algorithmic approaches, either based on citation or semantic approaches, lack conceptual consistency regarding the type of categories used: in a same classification a category captures methods, another one has materials, a third one contains empirical objects and a fourth is focused on theories, rather than having a single logic. I argue that science mapping would produce more useful representations by using ontologies based on a single logic that aligns with the particular conceptual needs of the analysis. Novel classification methods based on machine learning and language models hold promise to produce these tailored, question-driven ontologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Ontologies; Science Maps","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003418484"

To address these challenges, this study proposes an integrated framework combining resource modeling and resource state adaptive collaboration mechanism. First, a resource modeling framework for state coordination (RMFS) is developed to unify the representation of heterogeneous resources, their functionalities, and collaborative relationships through hybrid structural and semantic modeling. A resource state adaptive collaboration mechanism (RSACM) integrates multi-agent systems with knowledge graph to achieve real-time state synchronization. Agents utilize the collaborative relationships in the graph to make adaptive collaborative decisions on resource states, in order to perform state transitions and alleviate resource availability conflicts. Further, a meta-path-based resource inference (MPRI) method enables efficient resource retrieval and applies to simulation experiments by leveraging conceptual-instance meta-paths and large language model (LLM)-augmented substitution strategies to resolve resource unavailability. Experimental validation across emergency healthcare scenario demonstrates the framework’s effectiveness. An extension study was conducted on RMFS and RSACM through two cases from different fields. The proposed approach advances CPHS resource management by addressing heterogeneity, availability, and cooperativity in dynamic environments, offering theoretical and practical insights for complex system collaboration under spatiotemporal constraints. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Meta Modeling; Multi-agent Systems; Ontology Modeling; Resource State Collaboration; State Transformation","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003100864"

To address this limitation, an ontology-based AI agent system can be employed. This study proposes a conceptual model of AI agent-based indoor environmental informatics (IEI), develops an indoor environmental ontology by extending Brick schema, and demonstrates its application in real indoor environment. AI agent-based IEI is an approach that builds an integrated information system to capture relationships among indoor environments, occupants, and building systems so that utilizes AI agent for continuous indoor environment management. The AI agent leverages indoor environmental ontology, intrusive data, and indoor environmental toolkit to perform holistic analysis of indoor thermal environments and provides strategies for enhancing thermal comfort during the operational phase. The proposed concept was implemented in the Dynamo environment and applied to an office space. For the collection of real indoor environmental data, intrusive measurement was conducted over five days, and an indoor environmental ontology for the target space was developed. Indoor environmental toolkit used for the system included spatial coordinate extractor (SCE) for extracting spatial element coordinates, ontology file generator (OFG) for creating ontology files, and predicted mean vote (PMV) model for calculating PMV. The AI agent identified a PMV variation of 0.77, a discomfort rate of 28.2 %, and the disparity between physical sensor data and occupants’ subjective thermal comfort. Furthermore, the AI agent suggested practical strategies for improvement, including determining window status based on outdoor temperature, adjusting air conditioner operation, and modifying occupant seating arrangements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Agent; Brick Schema; Indoor Environments; Llm; Ontology; Pmv; Thermal Environment; Indoor Air Pollution; Agent Based; Ai Agent; Brick Schema; Environmental Informatics; Indoor Environment; Llm; Ontology's; Predicted Mean Vote; Thermal; Thermal Environment; Brick; Air Conditioning; Artificial Intelligence; Building; Information System; Sensor","Indoor air pollution; Agent based; AI agent; Brick schema; Environmental Informatics; Indoor environment; LLM; Ontology's; Predicted mean vote; Thermal; Thermal environment; Brick; air conditioning; artificial intelligence; building; information system; sensor","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001303229"

Fall protection systems (FPS) are critical for preventing falls in the work-at-height (WAH) environment. However, challenges in designing and selecting effective FPS persist across various industries, and existing tools often lack practical references. This study aims to develop an FFH-specific knowledge graph (FFH-KG) to support FPS design. By structuring accident data, the FFH-KG provides empirical insights to help designers improve FPS frameworks, aiding safety planning and decision-making. It serves as a decision support system for FPS designers and safety professionals, guiding the selection and design of appropriate protection solutions for diverse WAH scenarios. The FFH-KG was constructed using a hybrid natural language processing approach, combining manual extraction, entity recognition, text segmentation, and rule-based relation extraction. It was grounded in a schema layer (i.e., ontology) established by experts. A text-mining approach, integrating machine learning with a large language model, facilitated the categorization of fall types, refinement of WAH scenarios, and identification of fall causes, enhancing the content and applicability of knowledge graph. A total of 2,200 entities and 4,820 relationships were created based on fall protection equipment standard documents and fall-from-height accident investigation reports, forming a foundation for developing countermeasures. The retrieval performance of FFH-KG was validated through three case studies.

However, this requires a lot of time and effort for most of the users, which makes KGs inaccessible to a large number of users. Large Language Models (LLMs) that have appeared recently can provide an alternative way to query knowledge graphs without the need to learn SPARQL and/or know the schema and vocabulary of them, eliminating the time and effort that ordinary users need to spend in order to use them. In this article, we present some experiments and their results illustrating how ChatGPT can help ordinary users to generate SPARQL queries, without knowing SPARQL, to effectively use knowledge graphs and exploit their wealth of data. We experimented with ChatGPT to explore whether it can generate SPARQL queries based on user's natural language input and a given vocabulary (ontology) about an educational knowledge graph. To this end we have devised a specific prompt template. Results indicate that LLMs can indeed help in this direction, given the fact that they are prompted properly, using good English language.

Governance is one such sector. Public administrations around the globe produce millions of documents including laws, administrative decisions and acts (e.g., travel/budget approvals) that contain valuable information in unstructured way. The documents are usually stored at document-centered repositories. As a result the actual data of the documents cannot be further searched or processed. The availability of structured metadata of the documents (e.g., who has traveled, where, when) could further enhance the searching and processing of the documents as well as enable data analytics. The construction of metadata can be done through information extraction approaches such as Named Entity Recognition (NER), Relation Extraction (RE) and Event Extraction (EE) on the documents. LLMs are recently used successfully for information extraction tasks, while ontologies are traditionally used for meaningful data modeling. The aim of the paper is to apply and evaluate an ontology-aware zero-shot LLM prompting approach for information extraction in Greek language documents available in DIAVGEIA.gov.gr - the Greek Open Government portal for administrative documents.

In fields such as sustainability research, discussions about the co-production of knowledge emphasise the involvement of diverse stakeholders in generating relevant information for democratic decision-making processes. Particularly in technology-intensive areas like energy, the voices of experts have traditionally dominated, often marginalising the perspectives of citizens affected by energy policies and leading to epistemic injustices. Social media serves as a central forum for political activity and civic engagement, making it an important research environment for understanding the complexities of knowledge production and sharing. In my dissertation, I explore the opportunities and challenges of integrating citizen voices into the co-production of knowledge through social media using artificial intelligence (AI) based methods. My approach includes analysing stakeholder perspectives across social media, policymakers' speeches, and traditional media, using the discourse on energy justice in the context of sustainable energy transition as empirical material. Additionally, I conduct a comparative analysis of a rule-based ontological classification tool and a large language model (LLM) chatbot as qualitative content analysis tools. I demonstrate that social media data can reveal critical perspectives and marginalised discourses that might otherwise be overlooked. However, social media platforms are also used to spread disinformation and incite polarisation, which undermines their reliability as accurate reflections of prevailing attitudes and opinions in society. In addition, although AI methods can make information processing more effective and support the use of large datasets, it is important to consider their inherent limitations. I address the biases and ethical concerns associated with social media data and AI-based analysis tools and discuss potential solutions to mitigate these challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Social Sciences; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Social Media; Artificial Intelligence; Decision Making; Energy Policy; Energy Transition; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Transfer; Large Datasets; Sustainable Development; Co-production Of Knowledge; Computational Social Science; Energy; Energy Transitions; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Social Media; Social Networking (online)","Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Energy policy; Energy transition; Knowledge management; Knowledge transfer; Large datasets; Sustainable development; Co-production of knowledge; Computational social science; Energy; Energy transitions; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Social media; Social networking (online)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009246686"

Sir Tim Berners-Lee's seminal work “Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web”, envisioned a World Wide Web where information is not only accessible but structured, allowing machines to interpret data meaningfully. This vision laid the groundwork for technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language), which serve as foundational components for modern KGs. However, the process of building domain-specific KGs from extensive text corpora is highly complex and resource-intensive, requiring careful task design for entity recognition, disambiguation, and relationship extraction, among others. These tasks are essential to ensure accuracy and relevance in knowledge representation, but they pose considerable challenges. Addressing these complexities is crucial for the continued advancement and application of KGs across domains. In this context, the 4th NLP4KGC workshop is held to create a collaborative platform for researchers, practitioners, and industry experts in NLP and KG construction. Following the success and growing community engagement in the previous three editions, this year's workshop aims to deepen collaboration and encourage innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field. The 4th NLP4KGC will continue to bridge academia and industry, fostering the exchange of insights, tools, and methodologies at the intersection of NLP and KG development.

Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for processing such data but struggle with factual accuracy and provenance. Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a structured framework to address these limitations [6], yet constructing high-quality KGs from heterogeneous data remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present Docs2KG, a modular framework to build high-quality KGs from diverse unstructured documents. We first employs state-of-the-art document processing techniques to extract textual content, tabular data, and figures. The extracted information is then unified into a multifaceted KG with three aspects: (1) a Layout KG capturing document structural hierarchies, (2) a Metadata KG preserving document properties, and (3) a Semantic KG representing domain-specific entities and relationships. Docs2KG supports multiple construction paradigms for Semantic KG: ontology-based approaches, hybrid NLP pipelines with LLM verification, LLM-guided ontology generation, and specialized models for named entity recognition, event extraction, and causal relationship identification to enhance semantic coverage and accuracy.

However, conventional approaches to functional enrichment frequently produce extensive and redundant term lists, complicating interpretation and synthesis. Moreover, the absence of specialized tools tailored to proteomics researchers limits the efficient exploration of protein expression within specific biological contexts. To address these challenges, we developed Ontolomics-P, a user-friendly web-based tool designed to advance proteomics data interpretation. Ontolomics-P integrates topic modeling using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) with GO semantic similarity analysis, enabling the consolidation of redundant terms into coherent topics. These topics are further refined and reannotated using the GPT-4o language model, creating a novel topics database that provides precise and interpretable insights into shared biological functions. Additionally, Ontolomics-P incorporates quantitative proteomic data from 10 diverse cancer types archived in the CPTAC database, allowing for a comprehensive exploration of protein expression profiles from a data-driven perspective. Through detailed case studies, we demonstrate the tool’s capacity to streamline workflows, simplify interpretation, and provide actionable biological insights. Ontolomics-P represents a significant advancement in proteomics data analysis, offering innovative solutions for functional annotation, quantitative exploration, and visualization, ultimately empowering researchers to accelerate discoveries in systems biology and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomolecules; Cloning; Data Reduction; Data Visualization; Gene Transfer; Genome; Biological Functions; Clinical Proteomics; Data Interpretation; Data-driven Analysis; Functional Enrichment Analysis; Gene Ontology; Ontology Enrichment; Ontology's; Protein Expression Patterns; Proteomics","Biomolecules; Cloning; Data reduction; Data visualization; Gene transfer; Genome; Biological functions; Clinical proteomics; Data interpretation; Data-driven analysis; Functional enrichment analysis; Gene ontology; Ontology enrichment; Ontology's; Protein expression patterns; Proteomics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004388278"

In a short space of time, LLMs have permeated a wide array of disciplines including healthcare, finance, education, etc. However, in their native form, LLMs retain information in their parameters, which sometimes causes the underlying models to produce inaccurate results or hallucinations. To that end, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to address some of the challenges of LLMs by referencing an external knowledge base while formulating a response to queries. Still, traditional RAG fails to handle the complex structure of relationships among different entities in structured data such as knowledge graphs. GraphRAG, a successor of basic RAG, leverages structural information contained in graphs to enable more precise and comprehensive retrieval thereby facilitating more accurate, context-aware responses. GraphRAG has been applied in many domains, but its use in a cybersecurity context has not been widely explored. In this research, we propose a framework that applies GraphRAG to network security monitoring. By generating knowledge graphs from network logs, we provide LLMs with more structured data, backed by an ontology, that enables the models to perform high-level reasoning to answer questions regarding the security posture of an organization more accurately. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cybersecurity; Graph Structures; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Natural Language Processing Systems; Query Processing; Complexes Structure; External Knowledge; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Language Processing; Native Forms; Natural Languages; Networks Security; Structural Information; Structured Data; Network Security","Cybersecurity; Graph structures; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Complexes structure; External knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Language processing; Native forms; Natural languages; Networks security; Structural information; Structured data; Network security","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007936734"

This repository is maintained by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) that developed a Vulnerability Description Ontology framework for characterizing vulnerabilities. Despite advancements in secure software development and vulnerability detection techniques, the number of registered cybersecurity vulnerabilities continues to grow. Characterizing vulnerabilities is essential for selecting effective protection mechanisms to prevent or mitigate cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software and hardware and reduce cyber risks. Manual characterization of vulnerabilities is both time-consuming and costly. While many researchers employ Machine Learning (ML)-based methods to predict characterizations, these methods heavily rely on large amounts of labeled training data. To overcome the challenge of limited labeled data, this paper proposes a solution utilizing three Large Language Models (LLMs) - GPT-4o, Llama-3.1-405B, and Gemini-1.5-flash - to automate the characterization of vulnerabilities across 27 categories, grouped into five noun groups. We use both few-shot and zero-shot learning to prompt the LLMs. Our experimental results show that GPT-4o achieves F1-scores of 80%, 90%, 90%, and 73% in the context, impact-method, attack theater, and logical impact noun groups, respectively, using a few labeled samples.

Here, two new datasets with over 1.5 million experimental procedures and their (semi)automatic annotations as action graphs, i.e., structured output, were created and used for training two different transformer-based large language models. These models strike a balance between performance, generality, and fitness for purpose and can be hosted and run on standard consumer-grade hardware. Furthermore, the generation of node graphs from these action graphs as a user-friendly and intuitive way of visualizing and modifying synthesis workflows that can be run on the hardware of a Self-Driving Lab or Material Acceleration Platform is explored. Lastly, it is discussed how knowledge graphs - following an ontology imposed by the underlying node setup and software architecture - can be generated from the node graphs.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest in using ontology-based metadata models to address this issue, as they offer a structured approach to organize and share information across diverse systems (e.g. Brick ontology). However, the creation of ontology-based metadata models is often a labor-intensive task that requires specific domain expertise, hindering the practical use of such data models. For this reason, in this work the BrickLLM Python library is introduced, which addresses this issue by generating Brick-compliant Resource Description Framework graphs through Large Language Models, automating the process of converting natural language building descriptions into machine-readable metadata. The library supports both cloud-based APIs (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Fireworks AI), local models (e.g. LLaMa3.2, etc.) and evenfine-tuned ones.

There is inadequate support for aiding and automating problem formulation, variable and parameter identification and representation, and early-stage conceptual decisions. Therefore, this paper presents an innovative, transparent, and explainable method employing semantic reasoning to automate the step-by-step conceptual design generation process, including problem formulation, identification and representation of the variables and parameters and their dependencies. The method is realized through a novel framework called Knowledge Augmented Generalizer Specializer (KAGS). KAGS employs the Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology and the Graph-of-Thought (GoT) mechanism to enable automated reasoning with a Large Language Model (LLM). The workflow comprises various stages: problem breakdown, design prototype creation, assessment, and prototype merging. The framework is implemented and tested on a Subsea Layout (SSL) planning problem, a special class of infrastructure planning projects in deep-sea oil and gas production systems. The experimentations with KAGS demonstrate its capacity to support problem formulation, hierarchical decomposition, and solution generation. The research also provides new insights into the FBS framework and meta-level reasoning in early design stages. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Design Exploration; Design Outcomes; Early Stage Designs; Engineering Design Programs; Model Problems; Ontology's; Parametric Models; Problem Formulation; Problem Representation; Routine Engineerings; Gas Industry","Design Exploration; Design outcomes; Early stage designs; Engineering design programs; Model problems; Ontology's; Parametric models; Problem formulation; Problem representation; Routine engineerings; Gas industry","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216774787"

Recent works adopt fixed or learnable prompts, i.e., classification weights are synthesized from natural language descriptions of task-relevant categories, to reduce the gap between tasks during the pre-training and inference phases. However, how and what prompts can improve inference performance remains unclear. In this paper, we explicitly clarify the importance of incorporating semantic information into prompts, while existing prompting methods generate prompts without sufficiently exploring the semantic information of textual labels. Manually constructing prompts with rich semantics requires domain expertise and is extremely time-consuming. To cope with this issue, we propose a knowledge-aware prompt learning method, namely Confounder-pruned Knowledge Prompt (CPKP), which retrieves an ontology knowledge graph by treating the textual label as a query to extract task-relevant semantic information. CPKP further introduces a double-tier confounder-pruning procedure to refine the derived semantic information. Adhering to the individual causal effect principle, the graph-tier confounders are gradually identified and phased out. The feature-tier confounders are eliminated by following the maximum entropy principle in information theory. Empirically, the evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of CPKP in few-shot inference, e.g., with only two shots, CPKP outperforms the manual-prompt method by 4.64% and the learnable-prompt method by 1.09% on average. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Large-scale Pre-training; Maximum Entropy; Multi-modal Model; Prompt Learning; Semantics; Visual Languages; Confounder; Knowledge Graphs; Large-scale Pre-training; Large-scales; Maximum-entropy; Modal Models; Multi-modal; Multi-modal Model; Pre-training; Prompt Learning; Knowledge Graph; Article; Confounding Variable; Human; Knowledge; Language Model; Learning; Maximum Entropy Model; Semantics; Training; Vision; Algorithm; Artificial Neural Network; Language; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Algorithms; Humans; Knowledge; Language; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer","Semantics; Visual languages; Confounder; Knowledge graphs; Large-scale pre-training; Large-scales; Maximum-entropy; Modal models; Multi-modal; Multi-modal model; Pre-training; Prompt learning; Knowledge graph; article; confounding variable; human; knowledge; language model; learning; maximum entropy model; semantics; training; vision; algorithm; artificial neural network; language; machine learning; natural language processing; Algorithms; Humans; Knowledge; Language; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Neural Networks, Computer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215571763"

Fault diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) is essential as it interlinks multi-source data related to industrial robot faults, capturing multi-level semantic associations among different fault events. However, the construction and application of fine-grained fault diagnosis KG face significant challenges due to the inherent complexity of nested entities in maintenance texts and the severe scarcity of annotated industrial data. In this study, we propose a Large Language Model (LLM) assisted data augmentation approach, which handles the complex nested entities in maintenance corpora and constructs a more fine-grained fault diagnosis KG. Firstly, the fine-grained ontology is constructed via LLM Assistance in Industrial Nested Named Entity Recognition (assInNNER). Then, an Industrial Nested Label Classification Template (INCT) is designed, enabling the use of nested entities in Attention-map aware keyword selection for the Industrial Nested Language Model (ANLM) data augmentation methods. ANLM can effectively improve the model's performance in nested entity extraction when corpora are scarce. Subsequently, a Confidence Filtering Mechanism (CFM) is introduced to evaluate and select the generated data for enhancement, and assInNNER is further deployed to recall the negative samples corpus again to further improve performance. Experimental studies based on multi-source corpora demonstrate that compared to existing algorithms, our method achieves an average F1 increase of 8.25 %, 3.31 %, and 1.96 % in 5%, 10 %, and 25 % in few-shot settings, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fault Diagnosis; Industrial Robots; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Industrial Robots; Semantics; Data Augmentation; Faults Diagnosis; Fine Grained; Graph Construction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Multi-sources; Named Entity Recognition; Rapid Deployments; Knowledge Graph","Industrial robots; Semantics; Data augmentation; Faults diagnosis; Fine grained; Graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Multi-Sources; Named entity recognition; Rapid deployments; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215555067"

Ontology development is a resource-consuming task that requires the collaborative work of domain experts and ontology engineers. Therefore, companies invest considerable resources in order to generate and maintain Enterprise Knowledge Graphs and ontologies from large and complex datasets, most of which can be unfamiliar for ontology engineers. In this work, we study the use of Large Language Models to aid in the development of ontologies from datasets, ultimately increasing the automation of the generation of ontology-based Knowledge Graphs. As a result we have developed a structured workflow that leverages Large Language Models to enhance ontology engineering through data pre-processing, ontology planning, building, and entity improvement. Our method is also able to generate mappings and RDF data, but in this work we focus on the ontologies. The pipeline has been implemented in the OntoGenix tool. In this work we show the results of the application of OntoGenix to six datasets related to commercial activities.

Methods Our model integrates ontology modeling, web scraping, UIE, fine-tuning strategies, and graph databases, thereby covering knowledge modeling, extraction, and storage techniques. The Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration-UIE (ERNIE-UIE) model is fine-tuned and optimized using a small amount of annotated data.

It has rich historical and cultural connotations and demonstrates excellent artistic value. Its elegant shape and moist glaze make it an outstanding representative of traditional Chinese craft aesthetics. The production of celadon embodies the wisdom and creativity of ancient craftsmen and is an important carrier for the inheritance of excellent traditional Chinese culture. In the context of cultural digitization, constructing a cross-modal knowledge graph of celadon is one of the key technologies for promoting the protection and inheritance of celadon culture. In this process, matching the same entities across different modalities, which involves aligning the different modal features of equivalent entities, is crucial. However, the inherent structural differences between cross-modal data present challenges for alignment tasks. Traditional methods that rely on manually annotated data can ensure the accuracy of alignment to some extent, but they have problems such as low efficiency and high cost. In addition, coarse-grained annotated data can hardly meet the requirements for fine-grained concepts and for entity recognition when constructing a cross-modal knowledge graph. At present, the vision-language pretraining (VLP) model can effectively capture cross-modal semantic associations by learning rich cross-modal representations from large-scale unmarked image-text pair data. The strong cross-modal understanding ability of the VLP model can provide precise semantic associations and fine-grained entity recognition for aligning entities of different modalities in graph construction. Here, a cross-modal entity alignment method based on the VLP model, which can map multiple features of images, is proposed to maximize the degree of matching between celadon images and text. Method The cross-modal entity alignment method proposed in this study, which maps multiple features of images, is initialized with the publicly available VLP model for both the image and the text encoders, and the parameters of the encoders remain unchanged during the training process. The method mainly consists of four parts. First, on the basis of the visual characteristics of celadon images, local features in terms of contour, texture, and color are extracted. Then, a gated multifusion unit is introduced to adaptively assign weights to the image features, and the extracted multiple local image features are used to generate reliable fused features. Furthermore, a multilayer fully connected mapper is designed to learn the mapping of the fused features to an appropriate intermediate representation space by using multiple layers of nonlinear transformations, guiding the text encoder to generate text features that match the image features more closely. Finally, the model is trained and optimized via the information noise contrastive estimation loss function, that is, by optimizing the similarity of positive sample pairs and the difference in negative sample pairs through calculating the cosine similarity between cross-modality features, thereby establishing the connection between image features and text features. Result The proposed method was compared with four of the latest benchmark methods in an experimental comparison, namely, contrastive VLP in Chinese (CN-CLIP), context optimization (CoOp), conditional context optimization (CoCoOp), and mapping pictures to words (Pic2Word). The quantitative evaluation metrics are the recall rates, including R@1, R@5, R@10, and the mean recall(MR). The experiments were conducted using the ChinaWare dataset, so all methods were trained on this dataset. A data table comparing each method’s performance on recall rate metrics was provided. In terms of the MR metric, the proposed method outperformed zero-shot CN-CLIP<inf>ViT−B/16</inf> by 3. 2% in the text-to-image alignment task and by 7. 5% in the image-to-text task. CoOp focuses on text features;it also outperforms CoOp by 11. 4% and 12. 1%, respectively. Moreover, CoCoOp considers image features on the basis of CoOp, and the proposed method outperforms CoCoOp by 8. 4% and 9. 5%, respectively. Pic2Word also focuses on original image features and does not fully utilize other local image features to improve model performance, and the proposed method outperforms Pic2Word by 5. 8% and 5. 6%, respectively. Conclusion The cross-modal entity alignment method proposed in this study can fully explore the effective intermediate representation of image features to reconstruct text features without changing the parameters of the VLP model, thereby improving the cross-modal recognition accuracy of the details of celadon. The experimental results show that this method is superior to several state-of-the-art methods and has improved the performance of alignment. Ultimately, a celadon cross-modal knowledge graph with 8 949 nodes and 18 211 relationships was successfully constructed by applying technologies such as ontology modeling, data mining, and the cross-modal entity alignment method proposed in this study. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Celadon; Cross-modal; Entity Alignment; Knowledge Graph(kg); Vision-language Model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005448057"

Because of its rarity and biological complexity, treatment breakthroughs for osteosarcoma have been limited. To advance research in this field, we aimed to construct the first comprehensive osteosarcoma knowledge graph (OSKG) using the PubMed database. Methods: A systematic search of PubMed (2003–2023) using the keyword “osteosarcoma” yielded 25,415 abstracts. Leveraging BioBERT, pretrained on biomedical corpora and fine-tuned with osteosarcoma-specific manual annotations, we identified 16 entity types and 17 biological relationships. The extracted elements were synthesized to create the OSKG, resulting in a deep learning-based knowledge base to explore osteosarcoma pathogenesis and molecular mechanisms. We then developed a specialized question-answering system (knowledge graph question answering (KGQA)) powered by ChatGLM3. This system employs advanced natural language processing and incorporates the OSKG to ensure optimal response quality and accuracy. Results: The pretrained BioBERT averaged > 92 % accuracy in entity and relationship training. Evaluation using 100 pairs of gold-standard quizzes showed that the final quiz system outperformed other large language models in accuracy and robustness. Conclusion: The system is designed to provide accurate disease-related queries and answers, effectively facilitating knowledge acquisition and reasoning in medical research and clinical practice.

Although each RD affects a small population, collectively, between 3.5% and 5.9% of the global population, or 262.9–446.2 million people, live with an RD. Most RDs lack established treatment protocols, highlighting the need for proper care pathways addressing prognosis, diagnosis, and management.

Data sources such as maintenance records and machine documentation usually are not used to help maintenance decision-making. Available studies mainly focus on categorizing maintenance records or extracting meta-data, such as time of failure, maintenance cost, etc. One of the main reasons behind this underutilization is the complexity and unstructured nature of the industrial text. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid information retrieval approach for industrial text using multi-modal learning. Maintenance operators can use the proposed system to query maintenance records and find similar solutions to a given problem. The proposed system utilizes heterogeneous (multi-modal) data, a combination of maintenance records, and machine ontology to enhance semantic search results. We used the state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs); BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) for textual similarity. For similarity among ontology labels, we used a modified version of Wu-Palmer's similarity. A hybrid weighted similarity is proposed, incorporating text and ontology similarities to enhance semantic search results. The proposed approach was validated using an open-source dataset of real maintenance records from excavators collected over ten years from different mining sites. A retrieval comparison using only text and multi-modal data is performed to estimate the proposed system's effectiveness. Quantitative and qualitative analysis of results indicates a performance improvement of 8% using the proposed hybrid similarity approach compared to only text-based retrieval. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to combine LLMs and machine ontology for semantic search in maintenance records. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Industrial Information Integration; Industry 4.0; Large Language Models (llms); Machine Documentation; Multi-modal Learning; Semantic Search; Industrial Information Integration; Information Integration; Information Retrieval Approach; Language Model; Large Language Model; Machine Documentation; Maintenance Records; Multi-modal Learning; Ontology's; Semantic Search; Semantics","Industrial information integration; Information integration; Information retrieval approach; Language model; Large language model; Machine documentation; Maintenance records; Multi-modal learning; Ontology's; Semantic search; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000520964"

However, the increasing complexity and diversity of construction information requirements demand automated enrichment of BIM ontologies, which is hindered by several factors, including complexity in ontology structure, scalability limitations, and domain-specific issues. Manual curation and maintenance of ontologies are labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly as the scope of BIM projects expands. Despite these challenges, the construction industry lacks an effective automated approach for ontology concept enrichment. Thus, this study proposes a knowledge-enhanced ontology-to-vector (Keno2Vec) approach for automated BIM ontology concept enrichment, which can (1) encode ontology elements into meaningful and semantically rich embeddings by employing the BERT model to integrate both ontological information (names and labels) and external knowledge (definitions from authoritative knowledge bases), effectively addressing the domain expression specificity and complexity of BIM ontologies; and (2) provide a flexible framework that supports various downstream tasks of ontology concept enrichment by utilizing the resulting embeddings, thereby improving the task-specific adaptability and variability. Experimental results on datasets derived from the large-scale ifcOWL and two smaller BIM ontologies demonstrate that Keno2Vec significantly outperforms existing ontology embedding approaches in terms of accuracy and adaptability. For example, Keno2Vec achieves F1 scores on ifcOWL of nearly 87 % for subsumption prediction, 60 % for property identification, 95 % for membership recognition, and 100 % and 90 % for category-based and schema-based concept classification, respectively. Additional analysis highlights the potential of Keno2Vec for improving BIM ontology encoding and benefiting downstream applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bim Ontology; Natural Language Processing; Ontology Concept Enrichment; Ontology Embedding; Pre-trained Language Models; Semantic Representation; Encoding (symbols); Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Building Information Modeling Ontology; Building Information Modelling; Embeddings; Language Model; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Ontology Concept Enrichment; Ontology Concepts; Ontology Embedding; Ontology's; Pre-trained Language Model; Semantic Representation; Semantics","Encoding (symbols); Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Building information modeling ontology; Building Information Modelling; Embeddings; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology concept enrichment; Ontology concepts; Ontology embedding; Ontology's; Pre-trained language model; Semantic representation; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000158606"

Link keys are crucial for EM, serving as rules allowing to identify identity links across different KGs, possibly described using different ontologies. However, the approach for extracting link keys struggles to scale on large KGs. While embedding-based EM methods efficiently handle large KGs they lack explainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid EM approach to guarantee the scalability link key extraction approach and improve the explainability of embedding-based EM methods. First, embedding-based EM approaches are used to sample the KGs based on the identity links they generate, thereby reducing the search space to relevant sub-graphs for link key extraction. Second, rules (in the form of link keys) are extracted to explain the generation of identity links by the embedding-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows link key extraction to scale on large KGs, preserving the quality of the extracted link keys. Additionally, it shows that link keys can improve the explainability of the identity links generated by embedding-methods, allowing for the regeneration of 77% of the identity links produced for a specific EM task, thereby providing an approximation of the reasons behind their generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Embedding-based Em; Entity Matching; Graph Embeddings; Hybrid Ai; Knowledge Graphs; Language Models; Link Keys; Symbolic Em; Embedding-based Entity Matching; Embeddings; Entity Matching; Graph Embeddings; Hybrid Ai; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Link Key; Symbolic Entity Matching","Embedding-based entity matching; Embeddings; Entity matching; Graph embeddings; Hybrid AI; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Link key; Symbolic entity matching","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005153249"

However, training on large-scale corpora often fails to effectively organize domain knowledge of LLMs, leading to fragmented understanding. Inspired by how humans connect concepts and organize knowledge through mind maps, we aim to emulate this approach by using ontology with hierarchical conceptual knowledge to reorganize LLM’s domain knowledge. From this perspective, we propose an ontology-driven self-training framework called OntoTune, which aims to align LLMs with ontology through in-context learning, enabling the generation of responses guided by the ontology. We leverage in-context learning to identify whether the LLM has acquired the specific concept’s ontology knowledge, and select the entries not yet mastered by LLM as the training set to further align the LLM with ontology. Compared to existing domain LLMs based on newly collected large-scale domain-specific corpora, our OntoTune, which relies on the existing, long-term developed ontology and LLM itself, significantly reduces data maintenance costs and offers improved generalization ability. We conduct our study in the medical domain to evaluate the effectiveness of OntoTune, utilizing a standardized medical ontology, SNOMED CT as our ontology source. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoTune achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-ontology task hypernym discovery and out-of-ontology task medical domain QA. Moreover, compared to the latest direct ontology injection method TaxoLLaMA, our OntoTune better preserves original knowledge of LLM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Align With Ontology; Large Language Model; Self-training; Align With Ontology; Domain Knowledge; Domain Specific; Existing Domains; Language Model; Large Language Model; Large-scales; Ontology's; Scale Domains; Self-training","Align with ontology; Domain knowledge; Domain specific; Existing domains; Language model; Large language model; Large-scales; Ontology's; Scale domains; Self-training","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005140144"

We share examples of potentialities that are opened up through these orientations across the entire LLM development pipeline by conducting two ontological analyses: examining the responses of four LLM-based chatbots in a prompting exercise, and analyzing the architecture of an LLM-based agent simulation.

However, the search for reliable aging biomarkers is particularly challenging due to the intricate and multifactorial nature of the aging process. Furthermore, biomarker names and categories are not well-standardized in the current literature. While, a formal definition of a biomarker is nonexistent in the current literature, formally defining biomarkers and standardizing the vocabulary for biomarkers can help accelerate AI research around this concept which can lead to better, faster and more accurate analyses of the existing data and literature. Thus, in this work, we generated Knowledge Graphs that can help us define and standardize biomarkers. We present our Knowledge Graphs (KGs) generated using both an LLM and expert-curated datasets. We compare both KGs to understand why systematic integration between these two models is needed. The integration of Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a promising approach to advancing aging biomarker research through the inherent structured and standardized nature of ontology schemas in knowledge graphs. We showcase that the accuracy of LLM-generated KGs remains questionable but systematic methods such as KNARM can help us with the accuracy of these efforts.

Updating this classification represents a necessity to improve the indexing and retrieval of OPMD publications, in particular for systematic reviews and meta-analysis. Methods: Through a critical appraisal of the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) and Excerpta Medica Tree (EMTREE) thesauri, we assessed gaps in the indexing for OPMD literature and propose improvements for enhanced categorisation and retrieval. Results: The present study identifies inconsistencies and limitations in the classification of these disorders across the major medical databases, which may be summarized in the following findings: a) The MeSH database lacks a dedicated subject heading for “oral potentially malignant disorders”; b) EMTREE indexing is incomplete, with only 5 out of 11 recognised OPMD having corresponding terms; c) Incoherent controlled vocabulary mappings hinder systematic literature retrieval. Conclusion: To ensure accurate evidence synthesis, the authors recommend searching both PubMed and Embase for OPMD studies. Moreover, the use of Embase’s PubMed query translator and Large Language Models, such as ChatGPT, may lead to retrieval biases due to indexing discrepancies, posing challenges for early-career researchers and students. We recommend introducing “oral potentially malignant disorders” as a standardised subject heading.

Compiling these domain-specific datasets is a complex endeavor, demanding significant human effort and resources. To address the problem of domain-specific dataset scarcity, this study investigates the potential of generative large language models (LLMs) in creating synthetic domain-specific textual datasets for engineering design domains. By harnessing the advanced capabilities of LLMs, such as GPT-4, a systematic methodology was developed to create high-fidelity datasets using designed prompts, evaluated against a manually labeled benchmark dataset through various computational measurements without human intervention. Findings suggest that well-designed prompts can significantly enhance the quality of domain-specific synthetic datasets with reduced manual effort. The research highlights the importance of prompt design in eliciting precise, domain-relevant information and discusses the balance between dataset robustness and richness. It is demonstrated that a language model trained on synthetic datasets can achieve a level of performance comparable to that of human-labeled, domain-specific datasets in terms of quality, offering a strategic solution to the limitations imposed by dataset shortages in engineering domains. The implications for design thinking processes are particularly noteworthy, with the potential to assist designers through GPT-4's structured reasoning capabilities.

To achieve a fine-grained representation of emergency scenario knowledge and enhance the understanding of industrial chains and resource demands within such scenarios, this study addresses the gap in reusable ontologies. It does so by thoroughly analyzing the structure of data sources, organizing domain-specific regulatory documents, and referencing existing research. As a result, an integrated ontology library for emergency scenarios was developed, emphasizing four core elements: “emergency events”, “emergency tasks”, “emergency industries”, and “scenario data”. Following this, we employed databases and web crawling techniques to gather textual data pertaining to emergency events and resource allocation in China’s emergency industry over the past five years. After data cleaning, we obtained 3 572 valid records. Using this dataset, we introduced a knowledge extraction process utilizing the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers-Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-Conditional Random Field (BERT BiLSTM CRF) model and performed knowledge fusion through a combination of cosine similarity based on word frequency statistics and keyword matching. Furthermore, this study visually presented the construction results of three types of typical emergency scenario knowledge graphs and explored their application value. On one hand, by employing knowledge navigation and intelligent retrieval, the study offered a comprehensive analysis of the interconnections between emergency scenarios and industrial networks, as well as potential pathways for accelerating the development of the emergency industry. On the other hand, by developing a Python web-based Knowledge Graph-Large Language Model-Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG LLM RAG) intelligent question-answering system, this study investigated the integration of emergency scenario knowledge graphs with large language models. It emphasized their application value in providing decision-making support for material reserves, business expansion, and collaboration within the emergency industry. The research results demonstrate that the knowledge representation model developed in this study effectively organizes emergency industry information and scenario-specific demands in a fine-grained manner, while also capturing the relationships between multi-agent collaboration and resource supply within scenarios. The three types of typical emergency scenario knowledge graphs facilitate correlation analysis and deep mining of critical data, making them suitable for integration with large language models to develop intelligent question-answering systems. This provides valuable decision-making support for product and service positioning, material reserves, business expansion, and collaboration within the emergency industry. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emergency Scenarios; Industry Interconnection; Knowledge Graph; Public Safety","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009302500"

Therefore, developing methods that can rapidly extract valuable threat intelligence is a critical need to strengthen defence strategies and minimise potential damage. This paper presents an innovative approach that integrates knowledge graphs and a fine-tuned BERT-based model to analyse cyber threat intelligence (CTI) data. The proposed system extracts cyber entities such as threat actors, malware, campaigns, and targets from unstructured threat reports and establishes their relationships using an ontology-driven framework. A named entity recognition dataset was created and a BERT-based model was trained. To address the class imbalance, oversampling and a focal loss function were applied, achieving an F1 score of 96%. The extracted entities and relationships were visualised and analysed using knowledge graphs, enabling the advanced threat analysis and prediction of potential attack targets.

SERCA2a (sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase type 2a), which plays a crucial role in controlling intracellular Ca2+ signaling and myocardial cell function, is downregulated and inactivated during sepsis-induced heart dysfunction. However, the cause of this dysregulation remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the effect of lysine succinylation in lipopolysaccharide-induced septic heart dysfunction through global succinylome analysis of myocardial tissues from septic rats. METHODS: We conducted a succinylome profiling and developed a protein language model-based framework to prioritize succinylation at a functionally important site, and further analysis revealed crosstalk between ubiquitination and succinylation of SERCA2a. The succinylation of SERCA2a in septic rats or lipopolysaccharide-treated cells were detected by co-immunoprecipitation. Thereafter, a desuccinylated SERCA2aK352R was introduced and its function and stability were determined by Ca2+ transient and Western blot, respectively. Meanwhile, the effect on SERCA2aK352R on heart function was assessed in vivo by echocardiography and hemodynamics. RESULTS: We identified 10324 succinylated lysine sites in heart tissues, including 1042 differentially succinylated lysine sites, in response to lipopolysaccharide. SERCA2a was hypersuccinylated in the myocardial tissues of septic rats and lipopolysaccharide-treated cardiomyocytes. Increased ubiquitination level, reduced protein level, and activity of SERCA2a were observed, along with increased succinylation of SERCA2a in vivo and in vitro. K352 was essential for SERCA2a succinylation, which reduced SERCA2a protein level by promoting formation of the K48 ubiquitin chain on SERCA2a and its degradation by proteasomes. Co-immunoprecipitation combined with liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry identified that SIRT2 (sirtuin2), a deacylase, exhibited interaction with SERCA2a. Furthermore, SIRT2 decreased K352 succinylation of SERCA2a, suggesting that SIRT2 may function as a desuccinylase for SERCA2a. CONCLUSIONS: Succinylation of SERCA2a at K352, which was controlled by SIRT2, promotes its ubiquitinoylation and degradation by proteasomes in sepsis-induced heart dysfunction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lipopolysaccharide; Rats; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum; Sepsis; Ubiquitination; Calcium; Proteasome; Troponin T; Lysine; Atp2a2 Protein, Rat; Lipopolysaccharides; Lysine; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-transporting Atpases; Calcium; Creatine Kinase Mb; Proteasome; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium Transporting Adenosine Triphosphatase; Sirtuin 2; Troponin T; Atp2a2 Protein, Rat; Lipopolysaccharide; Lysine; Amino Acid Sequence; Animal Cell; Animal Experiment; Animal Model; Animal Tissue; Article; Cardiac Muscle Cell; Coimmunoprecipitation; Controlled Study; Deep Neural Network; Echocardiography; Enzyme Activity; Gene Expression; Gene Mutation; Gene Ontology; H9c2(2-1) Cell Line; Heart Contraction; Heart Death; Heart Function; Immunoblotting; Kegg; Liquid Chromatography-mass Spectrometry; Male; Nonhuman; Protein Degradation; Protein Expression; Protein Language Model; Rat; Sepsis; Ubiquitination; Western Blotting; Animal; Cardiac Muscle; Complication; Disease Model; Genetics; Metabolism; Sprague Dawley Rat; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Lipopolysaccharides; Lysine; Male; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteolysis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-dawley; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-transporting Atpases; Sepsis; Ubiquitination","calcium; creatine kinase MB; proteasome; sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium transporting adenosine triphosphatase; sirtuin 2; troponin T; Atp2a2 protein, rat; lipopolysaccharide; lysine; amino acid sequence; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cardiac muscle cell; coimmunoprecipitation; controlled study; deep neural network; echocardiography; enzyme activity; gene expression; gene mutation; gene ontology; H9c2(2-1) cell line; heart contraction; heart death; heart function; immunoblotting; KEGG; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; male; nonhuman; protein degradation; protein expression; protein language model; rat; sepsis; ubiquitination; Western blotting; animal; cardiac muscle; complication; disease model; genetics; metabolism; Sprague Dawley rat; Animals; Disease Models, Animal; Lipopolysaccharides; Lysine; Male; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Proteasome Endopeptidase Complex; Proteolysis; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Calcium-Transporting ATPases; Sepsis; Ubiquitination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000060636"

However, directly linking drug efficacy to the receptor-mediated activation of specific intracellular transducers and the resulting physiological outcomes remains challenging. It is unclear whether the enhanced therapeutic window of certain drugs─defined as the dose range that provides effective therapy with minimal side effects─stems from their low intrinsic efficacy across all signaling pathways or ligand bias, wherein specific transducer subtypes are preferentially activated in a given cellular system compared to a reference ligand. Accurately predicting safer compounds, through either low intrinsic efficacy or ligand bias, would greatly advance drug development. While AI models hold promise for such predictions, the development of deep learning models capable of reliably forecasting GPCR ligands with defined bioactivities remains challenging, largely due to the limited availability of high-quality data. To address this, we pretrained a model on receptor sequences and ligand data sets across all class A GPCRs and then refined it to predict low-efficacy compounds or biased agonists for individual class A GPCRs. This was achieved using transfer learning and a neural network incorporating natural language processing of target sequences and receptor mutation effects on signaling. These two fine-tuned models─one for low-efficacy agonists and one for biased agonists─are available on demand for each class A GPCR and enable virtual screening of large chemical libraries, thereby facilitating the discovery of compounds with potentially improved safety profiles. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Retina S Antigen; Ligands; Receptors, G-protein-coupled; Nvidia Rtx A4000 Gpu; Diagnosis; Drug Dosage; Drug Interactions; Targeted Drug Delivery; Cells Signaling; Class A; Drug Efficacy; Drug Targets; Drug-targeting; Focal Points; G Protein Coupled Receptors; Large Screenings; Learning Models; Transfer Learning; Ligands; Apelin Receptor; Cannabinoid Receptor; Dopamine Receptor; G Protein Coupled Receptor; Opiate Receptor; Retina S Antigen; Ligand; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Binding Affinity; Bioinformatics; Biological Activity; Classifier; Computer Model; Deep Learning; Deep Neural Network; Deep Transfer Learning Model; Dna Repair; Drug Development; Drug Efficacy; Drug Metabolism; Drug Safety; Drug Targeting; Gene Ontology; Gpcr Signaling; Intrinsic Activity; Language Processing; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Phosphorylation; Predictive Value; Protein Language Model; Rattus Norvegicus; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Receptor Intrinsic Activity; Signal Transduction; Transfer Learning (machine Learning); Drug Effect; Human; Metabolism; Preclinical Study; Procedures; Deep Learning; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Receptors, G-protein-coupled; Signal Transduction","Diagnosis; Drug dosage; Drug interactions; Targeted drug delivery; Cells signaling; Class A; Drug efficacy; Drug targets; Drug-targeting; Focal points; G protein coupled receptors; Large screenings; Learning models; Transfer learning; Ligands; apelin receptor; cannabinoid receptor; dopamine receptor; G protein coupled receptor; opiate receptor; retina S antigen; ligand; amino acid sequence; Article; binding affinity; bioinformatics; biological activity; classifier; computer model; deep learning; deep neural network; deep transfer learning model; DNA repair; drug development; drug efficacy; drug metabolism; drug safety; drug targeting; gene ontology; GPCR signaling; intrinsic activity; language processing; machine learning; natural language processing; phosphorylation; predictive value; protein language model; Rattus norvegicus; receiver operating characteristic; receptor intrinsic activity; signal transduction; transfer learning (machine learning); drug effect; human; metabolism; preclinical study; procedures; Deep Learning; Drug Discovery; Drug Evaluation, Preclinical; Humans; Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; Signal Transduction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000501881"

Materials and Methods: The dataset included 21 357 text messages from healthcare workers in 12 Missouri nursing homes. A sample of 860 messages was annotated by clinical experts to form a ""Gold Standard""dataset. Model performance was evaluated using classification metrics including Cohen's Kappa (κ), with κ ≥ 0.60 as the performance threshold. The selected model was fine-tuned. Extractions were clustered, labeled, and arranged into a structured taxonomy for exploration. Results: The fine-tuned model demonstrated improved extraction of 4M content (κ = 0.73). Extractions were clustered and labeled, revealing large groups of expressions related to care preferences, medication adjustments, cognitive changes, and mobility issues. Discussion: The preliminary development of the 4M model and 4M taxonomy enables knowledge extraction from clinical text messages and aids future development of a 4M ontology. Results compliment themes and findings in other 4M research.

The use of free text has implications in data reuse methods used for supporting clinical research since the query mechanisms used in cohort definition and patient matching are mainly based on structured data and clinical terminologies. This study aims to develop a method for the secondary use of clinical text by: (a) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) for tagging clinical notes with biomedical terminology; and (b) designing an ontology that maps and classifies all the identified tags to various terminologies and allows for running phenotyping queries. Methods and Results: Transformers-based NLP Models, concretely pre-trained RoBERTa language models, were used to process radiology reports and annotate them identifying elements matching UMLS Concept Unique Identifiers (CUIs) definitions. CUIs were mapped into several biomedical ontologies useful for phenotyping (e.g., SNOMED-CT, HPO, ICD-10, FMA, LOINC, and ICPC2, among others) and represented as a lightweight ontology using OWL (Web Ontology Language) constructs. This process resulted in a Linked Knowledge Base (LKB), which allows running expressive queries to retrieve reports that comply with specific criteria using automatic reasoning. Conclusion: Although phenotyping tools mostly rely on relational databases, the combination of NLP and Linked Data technologies allows us to build scalable knowledge bases using standard ontologies from the Web of data. Our approach enables us to execute a pipeline which input is free text and automatically maps identified entities to a LKB that allows answering phenotyping queries. In this work, we have only used Spanish radiology reports, although it is extensible to other languages for which suitable corpora are available. This is particularly valuable in regional and national systems dealing with large research databases from different registries and cohorts and plays an essential role in the scalability of large data reuse infrastructures that require indexing and governing distributed data sources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Deep Phenotyping; Electronic Health Records; Linked Data; Natural Language Processing; Radiology; Transformers; Clinical Research; Distributed Database Systems; Indexing (materials Working); Indexing (of Information); Metadata; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Query Languages; Records Management; Relational Database Systems; Structured Query Language; Terminology; Deep Learning; Deep Phenotyping; Electronic Health; Free Texts; Health Records; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Phenotyping; Transformer; Radiology; Article; Human; Icd-10; Knowledge Base; Logical Observation Identifiers Names And Codes; Medical Terminology; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine; Biological Ontology; Electronic Health Record; Radiology; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype","Clinical research; Distributed database systems; Indexing (materials working); Indexing (of information); Metadata; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Query languages; Records management; Relational database systems; Structured Query Language; Terminology; Deep learning; Deep phenotyping; Electronic health; Free texts; Health records; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Phenotyping; Transformer; Radiology; Article; human; ICD-10; knowledge base; Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes; medical terminology; natural language processing; phenotype; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; biological ontology; electronic health record; radiology; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214290792"

This study is structured in two phases, aiming to develop an intelligent approach to analyzing the trend and evolution of patent litigations. The first phase involves macro- and micro-patent analyses of the related technology domain. Macro patent analysis elucidates the fundamental patent information in the drone industry, while micro patent analysis leverages the technology function matrix (TFM) to identify R&D hotspots and potentials. The second phase involves litigation (judgement) mining based on large language model (LLM). Beginning with the construction of a knowledge ontology, the domain infringement landscape can be detected through TFMs. A comparative analysis of the two-phase TFMs (i.e., both TFMs of patent and infringement allocations) is then conducted to pinpoint the key legal actions and the relevant technology. To drill deeper in infringement mining, dynamic topic modeling (DTM) is applied to analyze trends and dynamics in drone controller technology over time.

However, water conservancy knowledge is dispersed across multi —source texts, which exhibit obvious unstructured and frag-mented characteristics, and knowledge extraction and effective utilization face challenges. To addresses the issues of low data quality and underutilization of knowledge in the field, this study focuses on the texts of flood defense and emergency rescue, and proposes an intelligent method for constructing a flood defense and emergency rescue knowdedge graph by improving the knowledge extraction model and combining unstructured data and external semi-structured data. Initially, a large language model is employed to extract term from unstructured texts and construct an ontology model based on term themes, a pretraining module is used to enhance text representation features, and a convolutional module is introduced to improve the entity knowdedge extraction model, and an entity data enhance-ment method is proposed to improve model accuracy. Then external encyclopedia data is extracted to expand the knowdedge coverage to build a complete flood defense and rescue knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieves an Fl score of 89.91% in entity knowdedge extraction, significantly outperforming baseline models. Finally, the application method of knowdedge graph in the field of flood defense and rescue is introduced, which can form a knowdedge engine for digital twin of water conservancy construction, providing knowledge support for flood control research and decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Twin; Flood Defense And Rescue; Knowledge Extraction; Knowledge Graph; Multi—source Data; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Emergency Rescue; Extraction Modeling; Flood Defence; Flood Defense And Rescue; Knowledge Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Multi-sources; Multi—source Data; Source Data; Water Conservancy; Flood Control","Knowledge graph; Ontology; Emergency rescue; Extraction modeling; Flood defence; Flood defense and rescue; Knowledge extraction; Knowledge graphs; Multi-Sources; Multi—source data; Source data; Water conservancy; Flood control","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003194264"

As the manual curation of ontology annotations becomes increasingly infeasible due to the exponential growth of biomedical and genomic data, natural language processing (NLP)-based systems have emerged as scalable alternatives. Evaluating these systems requires robust semantic similarity metrics that account for hierarchical and partially correct relationships often present in ontology annotations. This study explores the integration of graph-based and language-based embeddings to enhance the performance of semantic similarity metrics. Combining embeddings generated via Node2Vec and large language models (LLMs) with traditional semantic similarity metrics, we demonstrate that hybrid approaches effectively capture both structural and semantic relationships within ontologies. Our results show that combined similarity metrics outperform individual metrics, achieving high accuracy in distinguishing child–parent pairs from random pairs. This work underscores the importance of robust semantic similarity metrics for evaluating and optimizing NLP-based ontology annotation systems. Future research should explore the real-time integration of these metrics and advanced neural architectures to further enhance scalability and accuracy, advancing ontology-driven analyses in biomedical research and beyond. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Llms; Ontology Annotation; Semantic Similarity; Data Curation; Data Integration; Graph Embeddings; Natural Language Processing Systems; Scalability; Semantics; Annotation Systems; Gene Ontology; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Natural Languages; Ontology Annotations; Ontology's; Semantic Similarity; Similarity Metrics; Gene Ontology","Data curation; Data integration; Graph embeddings; Natural language processing systems; Scalability; Semantics; Annotation systems; Gene ontology; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural languages; Ontology annotations; Ontology's; Semantic similarity; Similarity metrics; Gene Ontology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001031577"

However, pipeline-based methods for translating place names splits the place name translation task into multiple sub-tasks, carries the risk of error propagation, resulting in lower efficiency and poorer accuracy. Meanwhile, there is relatively little research on place name joint translation. In this regard, the study proposes an English-Chinese place name joint translation method based on prompt learning and knowledge graph enhancement. This method aims to improve the accuracy of English-Chinese place name translation. The proposed method is divided into two parts: The first part is the construction of prompt word template for place name translation. For the translation task of place names, the study first analyzes the characteristics of the transliteration of specific names and the semantic translation of generic names, constructing prompt word templates for the joint translation of ordinary place names. Then, based on the prompt words for ordinary place name translation, it takes into account the translation characteristics of the derived parts in derived place names, constructing a prompt word template for the joint translation of derived place names. Ultimately, leveraging the powerful contextual learning ability of LLM (Large Language Models), it achieves the joint translation of English and Chinese place names. The second part is the construction of the ontology of place name translation knowledge graph. To retrieve relevant knowledge about the input place names, the study designs an ontology for a knowledge graph of place names translation aimed at the English-Chinese place name translation task, combining the needs of English-Chinese place name translation and the semantic relationships between place names. This enhances the contextual information of the input place names and improves the performance of large language models in the English-Chinese place name translation task. Experiments have shown that compared to traditional pipeline-based place name translation methods, the place name translation method proposed in the study has improved performance by 21.26% in ordinary place name translation and an average of 27.70% in the field of derived place name translation. In bilingual map production, the method effectively improves the efficiency and accuracy of toponymic translation.

Concerns regarding drug safety and economic interests serve as motivating factors for the efforts to identify ADEs. Hereby, social media platforms play an important role as a valuable source of reports on ADEs, particularly through collecting posts discussing adverse events associated with specific drugs. We aim with our study to assess the effectiveness of knowledge fusion approaches in combination with transformer-based NLP models to extract ADE mentions from diverse datasets, for instance, texts from Twitter, websites like askapatient.com, and drug labels. The extraction task is formulated as a named entity recognition (NER) problem. The proposed methodology involves applying fusion learning methods to enhance the performance of transformer-based language models with additional contextual knowledge from ontologies or knowledge graphs. Additionally, the study introduces a multi-modal architecture that combines transformer-based language models with graph attention networks (GAT) to identify ADE spans in textual data. A multi-modality model consisting of the ERNIE model with knowledge on drugs reached an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 71.84% on CADEC corpus. Additionally, a combination of a graph attention network with BERT resulted in an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 65.16% on SMM4H corpus. Impressively, the same model achieved an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 72.50% on the PsyTAR corpus, 79.54% on the ADE corpus, and 94.15% on the TAC corpus. Except for the CADEC corpus, the knowledge fusion models consistently outperformed the baseline model, BERT.

Due to the outstanding performance of LLMs, AI-Generated Content (AIGC) has also made important progress in multimodal knowledge creation referring to text, image, audio, and video. However, the security, privacy, and ethical risks associated with AIGC (e.g., fake news, social engineering attacks, and toxic content) have deeply weakened the compliance of AIGC. Although existing content moderation solutions can filter out several types of toxic content, the audit performance of different vendors and techniques are of varying quality. Some AIGC service providers improve the moderation effectiveness by introducing multiple sources of audit vendors. Due to the lack of general content moderation standards and taxonomy, the labels of multi-source moderation vendors vary greatly. To this end, We propose a novel massive label aggregation approach for content moderation named TCLens. First, we collect results of multi-vendor content moderation engines for building massive toxic labels for AIGC. Then, we introduce an ontology for better tagging with the capability of automatic updating and vendor-agnostic. Finally, we implement a prototype of TCLens.

Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective: To mitigate that issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large language models (LLMs) as oracles. Methods: Starting from (i) an initial schema composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution: We formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs. Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the proposed method. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation; Domain-specific Knowledge; Large Language Models; Nutrition; Ontology Population; Intelligent Systems; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Semantics; Structured Query Language; Domain-specific Knowledge; Error Prones; Human Expert; Language Model; Large Language Model; Novel Domain; Ontology Population; Ontology's; Property; Semantic Data; Domain Knowledge","Intelligent systems; Modeling languages; Ontology; Semantics; Structured Query Language; Domain-specific knowledge; Error prones; Human expert; Language model; Large language model; Novel domain; Ontology Population; Ontology's; Property; Semantic data; Domain Knowledge","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214522484"

The system relies on two crucial stages: (i) identifying emerging properties from data and transforming them into abstract concepts, and (ii) converting these concepts into natural language. Despite the impressive natural language generation capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models, their statistical nature and the intricacy of their internal mechanism still force us to employ these techniques as black boxes, forgoing trustworthiness. Developing an explainable pipeline for data interpretation would allow facilitating its use in safety-critical environments like processing medical information and allowing non-experts and visually impaired people to access narrated information. To this end, we believe that the fields of knowledge representation and automated reasoning research could present a valid alternative. Expanding on prior research that tackled the first stage (i), we focus on the second stage, named Concept2Text. Being explainable, data translation is easily modeled through logic-based rules, once again emphasizing the role of declarative programming in achieving AI explainability. This paper explores a Prolog/CLP-based rewriting system to interpret concepts-articulated in terms of classes and relations, plus common knowledge-derived from a generic ontology, generating natural language text. Its main features include hierarchical tree rewritings, modular multilingual generation, support for equivalent variants across semantic, grammar, and lexical levels, and a transparent rule-based system.

Taking up the theoretical perspective, we begin by considering the relative inefficiency of large language models in acquiring language. A framework is introduced based on the concept of morphological computation and formalised with reference to conditional Kolmogorov complexity: that the form of embodied experience scaffolds human language acquisition. This argument is extended to consider the symbol grounding problem, with particular reference to the origin of language in both the individual and historical sense. It is argued that, while humans also make use of statistical learning, the process of symbol grounding via morphological computation is essential at the origins of language and during early development. It provides a minimal ontology in terms of objects, containers, processes, etc.-basic features which language models must instead brute force by statistical means. The paper closes by reconsidering the symbol grounding problem in light of recent advances, particularly the promise of multi-modal models and robotics, and ultimately concludes that the status of the symbol grounding problem depends upon our aims in the pursuit of artificial intelligence. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Morphological Computation; Multi-modal Language Learning; Multi-modal Language Models; Robotics; Symbol Grounding; Adversarial Machine Learning; Basic (programming Language); Computer Aided Language Translation; Computer Simulation Languages; Contrastive Learning; Digital Elevation Model; Linguistics; Ontology; Problem Oriented Languages; Robot Learning; Language Learning; Language Model; Large Language Model; Modal Language; Morphological Computation; Multi-modal; Multi-modal Language Learning; Multi-modal Language Model; Symbol Grounding; Scaffolds","Adversarial machine learning; BASIC (programming language); Computer aided language translation; Computer simulation languages; Contrastive Learning; Digital elevation model; Linguistics; Ontology; Problem oriented languages; Robot learning; Language learning; Language model; Large language model; Modal language; Morphological computation; Multi-modal; Multi-modal language learning; Multi-modal language model; Symbol grounding; Scaffolds","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000685544"

However, conventional machine learning approaches struggle with semantic complexity and limited Chinese disaster corpus. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities to overcome these challenges due to their enhanced semantic comprehension and multi-task learning capabilities. This study investigates the potential application of LLMs in disaster intelligence extraction and proposes an efficient, scalable method for multi-hazard DGI extraction. Building upon a unified ontological framework encompassing core natural disaster elements, this method employs parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA) fine-tuning to optimize open-source Chinese LLMs using a meticulously curated instruction-tuning dataset. It achieves simultaneous identification of multi-hazard intelligence cues and extraction of disaster spatial entity attributes from unstructured Chinese social media texts through unified semantic parsing and structured knowledge mapping. Compared to pre-trained models such as BERT and ERNIE, the proposed method was shown to achieve state-of-the-art evaluation results, with the highest recognition accuracy (F1-score: 0.9714) and the best performance in structured information generation (BLEU-4 score: 92.9649). Furthermore, we developed and released DGI-Corpus, a Chinese instruction-tuning dataset covering various disaster types, to support the research and application of LLMs in this field. Lastly, the proposed method was applied to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution patterns of the Zhengzhou “7.20” flood disaster. This study enhances the efficiency of natural disaster monitoring and emergency management, offering technical support for disaster response and mitigation decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emergency Management; Geospatial Intelligence; Large Language Models; Natural Disasters; Social Media; Spatiotemporal Information Mining","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218853736"

This study examines the performance of fine-tuned large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and Mistral 7B, in efficiently automating OE tasks. Foundational OE textbooks are used as the basis for dataset creation and for feeding the LLMs. The methodology involved segmenting texts into manageable chapters, generating question–answer pairs, and translating visual elements into description logic to curate fine-tuned datasets in JSONL format. This research aims to enhance the models’ abilities to generate domain-specific ontologies, with hypotheses asserting that fine-tuned LLMs would outperform base models, and that domain-specific datasets would significantly improve their performance. Comparative experiments revealed that GPT-4 demonstrated superior accuracy and adherence to ontology syntax, albeit with higher computational costs. Conversely, Mistral 7B excelled in speed and cost efficiency but struggled with domain-specific tasks, often generating outputs that lacked syntactical precision and relevance. The presented results highlight the necessity of integrating domain-specific datasets to improve contextual understanding and practical utility in specialized applications, such as Search and Rescue (SAR) missions in wildfire incidents. Both models, despite their limitations, exhibited potential in understanding OE principles. However, their performance underscored the importance of aligning training data with domain-specific knowledge to emulate human expertise effectively. This study, based on and extending our previous work on the topic, concludes that fine-tuned LLMs with targeted datasets enhance their utility in OE, offering insights into improving future models for domain-specific applications. The findings advocate further exploration of hybrid solutions to balance accuracy and efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain-specific Knowledge; Large Language Models (llms) Fine-tuning; Ontology Engineering (oe); Search And Rescue (sar); Ontology; Syntactics; Domain Specific; Domain-specific Knowledge; Fine Tuning; Language Model; Large Language Model Fine-tuning; Ontology Engineering; Performance; Search And Rescue; Domain Knowledge","Ontology; Syntactics; Domain specific; Domain-specific knowledge; Fine tuning; Language model; Large language model fine-tuning; Ontology engineering; Performance; Search and rescue; Domain Knowledge","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218624656"

The sources of knowledge in our analysis were records of production meetings, focused on production disturbance (PD). The main obstacle is to properly identify the specific meaning of words, in a specific, usually narrow, industry. Machine learning based on data from production records has been increasingly used to build such models. In the case of manufacturing plants with diverse production programs, acquiring the right number and structure of data is not possible; hence, proper identification of such terms is for classical NLP tools, even supported by large language models, not possible. We have attempted to use AI and NLP tools from recorded production meeting recordings to create and continuously update PD’s knowledge as a supplement to data from documentation. This is an approach not previously known in the field of production management. The solution we developed consists of an expert-defined specific ontology, based on the pre-processed speeches. At this stage, a lexicon (vocabulary) is also created, supporting the transformation of the speeches into interpretable texts. The model ontology formulated this way is then used to analyze consecutively provided meeting records and thus update the operational ontology. In our research, we used the materials provided to us in the form of records of production meetings from a medium-sized pressure foundry.

While deep learning change detection models excel at extracting low-level semantic information from remote sensing images, they face challenges in distinguishing land-use type changes from non-land-use type changes, such as crop rotation, natural fluctuations in water levels, and forest degradation. To ensure a high recall rate in change detection, these models often generate a large number of false positive change polygons, requiring substantial manual effort to eliminate these false alarms. [Methods] To address this issue, this paper proposes a natural resource element change polygon purification algorithm driven by remote sensing spatiotemporal knowledge graph. The algorithm aims to minimize the false positive rate while maintaining a high recall rate, thereby improving the efficiency of natural resource element change monitoring. To support the intelligent construction and effective reasoning of the spatiotemporal knowledge graph, this study designed a remote sensing spatiotemporal knowledge graph ontology model taking into account spatiotemporal characteristics and developed a GraphGIS toolkit that integrates graph database storage and computation. This paper also introduces a vector knowledge extraction method based on the native spatial analysis of the GraphGIS graph database, a remote sensing image knowledge extraction method based on efficient fine-tuning of the SkySense visual large model, and a polygon purification knowledge extraction method based on the SeqGPT large language model. Under the constraints of the spatiotemporal ontology model, vector, image, and text knowledge converge to form a remote sensing spatiotemporal knowledge graph. Inspired by the manual operation methods for change polygon purification, this paper developed an automatic purification method of change polygons based on first-order logical reasoning within the knowledge graph. To improve the concurrent processing and human-computer interaction, this paper developed a remote sensing spatiotemporal knowledge graph management and service system. [Results] For the task of purifying natural resource element change polygons in Guangdong Province from March to June 2024, the proposed method achieved a true-preserved rate of 95.37% and a false-removed rate of 21.82%.

Over the past decade, metadata standard schemas such as Brick have been developed to address this challenge. Nevertheless, mapping BMS metadata with such standards accurately and efficiently continues to be a demanding task across both new and existing buildings. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) to tag BMS data points, thus facilitating metadata standardization efforts. Manual or rule-based methods are not only labor-intensive but also error-prone. Similarly, supervised learning approaches using Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing ( NLP) demand extensive labeled datasets, often making them laborious and inflexible to new BMS metadata types and tasks. We propose a novel three-step framework that enhances the tagging process by integrating a LLM with few-shot prompting and an embedding model. This approach not only improves result interpretability but also effectively mitigates hallucinations. This framework is further supported by analyses of the LLM's inherent capabilities, prompt-aided specific interpretation and output formatting, and evaluations of few-shot sizes.

Metadata’s importance has only increased with the pervasiveness of generative artificial intelligence–driven information activities and services. However, several challenges impact a library metadata model’s reusability, crosswalk, and interoperability with other metadata models. This paper posits that these problems stem from an underlying assumption that there should be only a few core metadata models that would be sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the heterogeneity of intradomain or interdomain settings. To that end, this paper advances a contrary view and substantiates its argument in three key steps. First, the paper introduces a novel way of thinking about a library metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally interlinked representation levels from perception to definition via properties. Second, the paper introduces the representational manifoldness implicit in each of the five levels, which cumulatively contributes to a conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly, the paper proposes a generative AI–driven, human–large language model collaboration-based metadata modeling approach to disentangle the entanglement inherent in each representation level, which would lead to a conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the author provides motivating scenarios and examples from libraries handling cancer information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Academic Libraries; Generative Ai; Human-llm Collaboration; Knowledge Organization; Knowledge Representation; Large Language Models; Metadata; Ontology-driven Metadata Models","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007344857"

The construction of knowledge graphs is a key approach to achieving the digitalization and intelligence of education. [Method/Process]: This paper leverages the rich video resources of existing national first-class undergraduate programs and, based on the teaching orientations of different universities, independently designs customized ontologies and extraction principles. These are then integrated into the LLM knowledge graph builder to ensure the hierarchical structure of the overall course framework. The course video content is transformed into text form, and large language models (LLMS) and word segmentation tools are used for core content extraction, text cleaning, and lexical analysis. The structured text is then converted into SPO (Subject-Predicate-Object) triplets database. [Results/Conclusions]: Finally, the database is imported into the LLM knowledge graph builder, which is pre-configured with extraction rules. It will automatically generate the knowledge graph. After the text is imported into the LLM knowledge graph builder, it will be manually checked to ensure it better meets the actual needs of the students. [Innovation/Limitations]: The research team plans to apply the knowledge graph to train a specialized knowledge-based Q&A assistant. This will support students’ understanding and self-assessment of knowledge points in an online learning community. Student feedback will be used to improve and enrich the knowledge graph. Compared to existing methods, this approach better aligns with the constantly evolving digital teaching resources available online, offering more comprehensive and higher-level automation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Course Resources; Intelligent Q&a; Knowledge Graph; Ontology Construction; Personalized Learning; Curricula; Federated Learning; Ontology; Students; Teaching; Course Resource; Graph-based; Hierarchical Structures; High Educations; Intelligent Q&a; Knowledge Graphs; Ontology Construction; Ontology's; Personalized Learning; Undergraduate Projects; Knowledge Graph","Curricula; Federated learning; Ontology; Students; Teaching; Course resource; Graph-based; Hierarchical structures; High educations; Intelligent Q&A; Knowledge graphs; Ontology construction; Ontology's; Personalized learning; Undergraduate projects; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219182993"

Extracting information from these reports can be achieved using embeddings combined with Large Language Models (LLMs), with domain knowledge being mandatory for this extracted information to be meaningful and properly presented to end-users. A solution for this challenge is the use of Knowledge Graphs (KG) to organize and relate all the information in a way that properly represents the concepts (e.g., entities, events, and processes) of the specific domain. A KG can address the lack of domain knowledge presented by LLMs, as well as enhance the semantics of embedding-based indexes such as those provided by Transformers, but also as a searching source itself that enables to take advantage of the information relationships (i.e., the natural links between entities or pieces of data). However, the creation of a KG from a specific domain based on unstructured data sources requires not only an ontology to describe the entities and their relationships but also strategies and tools capable of properly extracting and mapping them from the data sources to a KG. In this context, this work proposes a well engineering ontology to guide extracting information from Daily Operational Reports, structure them into KGs, and support information retrieval applications. To assure interoperability, the development of the proposed ontology is aligned with upper-level ontologies and industrial standards like ISO 15926. The results of this work include not only the ontology itself and the procedure followed to build it, but also a discussion of further applications that can be developed using it as a basis. The main applications resulting from this work are named entity recognition, visualization of incidents, classification of operations, templates and auto-filling of reports, calculation of drilling metrics, and queries within the reports database. We have noticed that having structured domain knowledge, in the form of an ontology and KG has improved the success of these applications compared to raw text processing. Finally, this work emphasizes the importance of domain knowledge in the form of a comprehensive ontology that focuses on the relevant entities of the application domain and enables the creation of KGs that can facilitate the organization and query of complex unstructured text information and enhance data analysis and LLM-based applications in the Oil&Gas domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Engineering Exhibitions; Exploratory Oil Well Drilling; Iso Standards; Liquefied Petroleum Gas; Metadata; Query Languages; Steganography; Structured Query Language; Data-source; Domain Knowledge; Embeddings; Extracting Information; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Oil And Gas Activities; Ontology's; Text Data; Well Engineering; Ontology","Engineering exhibitions; Exploratory oil well drilling; ISO Standards; Liquefied petroleum gas; Metadata; Query languages; Steganography; Structured Query Language; Data-source; Domain knowledge; Embeddings; Extracting information; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Oil and gas activities; Ontology's; Text data; Well engineering; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000236649"

They have a long course and a high disability rate, seriously affecting the quality of life of patients. Traditional Chinese medicine plays an important role in the diagnosis and treatment of rheumatic immune diseases. The unique theoretical system and rich treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine are preserved in ancient Chinese medical books. Methods: This study takes the content related to rheumatism in ancient traditional Chinese medicine books as the research object, integrates ontology theory and technology into the knowledge graph, and realizes the reconstruction of traditional Chinese medicine information knowledge. It provides a basic data structure for data mining and knowledge discovery. Results: This study is the first rheumatism-specific knowledge graph constructed based on ancient traditional Chinese medicine books. It has explored the construction method of a knowledge graph from ancient books by combining automatic labeling of mainstream large language models with manual review. Considering the knowledge characteristics of ancient traditional Chinese medicine books, where existing word segmentation technology struggles to accurately reproduce the original meaning, a new type of entity extraction method is proposed. Discussion: This provides an important foundation for improving the clinical diagnosis and treatment level of traditional Chinese medicine in treating rheumatism, further exploring the knowledge representation and application of traditional Chinese medicine in rheumatism treatment, and it has potential for future expansion and improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artifcial Intelligence; Data Managament; Knowledge Graph (kg); Llms; Rheumatic; Trad.

Simple commands sometimes do not guarantee desired responses, as LLMs are systems based on mathematical modeling and cannot cognitively be capable of understanding commands. Hence, a method is required to guide LLMs in performing tasks appropriately. This paper presents a method to develop model-based automation of role selection supported by ontology. This can allow for more accurate and relevant role recommendations than if done manually. As such, this optimization at hand improves the performance of LLMs for specific tasks and overcomes the limitations of previous studies that define the roles by hand. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Convolutional Network; Large Language Models; Ontology; Role-play","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219510809"

To simplify the individual components’ integration and to optimize their usage, a data broker is being developed. Therefore, digital twins need to be semantically organized in an ontology that provides the advantage of reasoning methods. An assisted workflow is being developed to automatically enter subgraphs into an ontology. As a digital twin representation, the Asset Administration Shell format is used to have an international standard technology. Based on this, a new domain-specific language is developed, allowing experts to configure the generation process. This process maps the digital twin’s information into a graph representation of the ontology. The preconfigured generation process enables the user to efficiently register new digital twins without having expert knowledge of the underlying ontology. Additionally, a Large Language Model vector embedding and text reasoning support is implemented analysing the digital twin to create entity suggestions. The presented data broker is an automation tool for bridging the gap between semantic descriptions and digital twin formats in order to unite the advantages of both representations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Administration Shell; Automation; Cyber-physical System; Digital Twin; Ontology; Knowledge Based Systems; Modeling Languages; Asset Administration Shell; Components Integration; Cybe-physical Systems; Cyber-physical Systems; Data Broker; Generation Process; Individual Components; Ontology's; Physical Objects; Reasoning Methods; Ontology","Knowledge based systems; Modeling languages; Asset administration shell; Components integration; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Data broker; Generation process; Individual components; Ontology's; Physical objects; Reasoning methods; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219206571"

However, the integration and exchange of such data is cumbersome, time-consuming, and error-prone. Semantic technologies, such as ontologies, KGs, and linked data, were developed to facilitate this but require comprehensive technical skills and complex methods for mapping relational data to semantic formalisms. Naturally, this process lacks speed, scalability, and automation. This work presents a novel user-driven neuro-symbolic approach to transform relational data into KGs. In our approach, users are supported by neural models (in particular Large Language Models) and symbolic formalisms (ontologies and mappings) to automate various mapping tasks and thus speed up and scale up the transformation from relational to linked data. We implemented our approach in a comprehensive intelligent assistant dubbed LXS. Our experimental evaluation, conducted primarily with participants from the Robert Bosch GmbH, demonstrates enhanced mapping quality compared to manual creation, a competitive application, and AI-only generations. Additionally, it significantly reduces user interaction time by nearly half, independent of the user’s experience level. Also, qualitatively, users appreciated the attractiveness and novelty of the user interface. Furthermore, the neuro-symbolic approach of LXS contributes to a more trustworthy human-AI interaction since it keeps users in the loop and provides transparency in the transformation process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hci; Knowledge Graph Creation; Neuro-symbolic; Graphical User Interfaces; Knowledge Graph; User Profile; Complex Methods; Error Prones; Knowledge Graph Creation; Knowledge Graphs; Neuro-symbolic; Ontology's; Relational Data; Semantic Technologies; Technical Skills; User Driven; Mapping","Graphical user interfaces; Knowledge graph; User profile; Complex methods; Error prones; Knowledge graph creation; Knowledge graphs; Neuro-symbolic; Ontology's; Relational data; Semantic technologies; Technical skills; User driven; Mapping","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218937379"

To overcome these limitations, we developed an automated framework, AutOnto, for knowledge extraction and ontology conceptualization that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. AutOnto integrates BERT-based topic modeling with LLMs to automate the extraction of concepts and relationships from text corpora, facilitating the construction of taxonomies and the generation of domain ontologies. We applied AutOnto to a dataset of NLP-specific articles from OpenAlex and compared the resulting ontology generated by our automated process against a well-established gold-standard ontology. The results indicate that AutOnto achieves comparable levels of quality and correctness while significantly reducing the amount of data required and the dependence on domain-specific expertise.

The more practically useful exploration of more complex alignments remains a hard problem to automate, and as such is largely underexplored, i.e. in application practice it is usually done manually by ontology and domain experts. Recently, the surge in Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities, driven by advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), presents new opportunities for enhancing ontology engineering practices, including ontology alignment tasks. This paper investigates the application of LLM technologies to tackle the complex ontology alignment challenge. Leveraging a prompt-based approach and integrating rich ontology content – so-called modules – our work constitutes a significant advance towards automating the complex alignment task. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex Ontology Alignment; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Modular Ontology Modeling; Ontology; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Complex Ontology Alignment; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Modular Ontologies; Modular Ontology Modeling; Ontology Alignment; Ontology Model; Ontology's; Semantic-web; Modeling Languages","Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Complex ontology alignment; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Modular ontologies; Modular ontology modeling; Ontology alignment; Ontology model; Ontology's; Semantic-Web; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218934218"

While effective, these systems are inherently domain-specific, requiring tailored ontologies that are costly, time-consuming, and demand expert knowledge to develop. To address these limitations, Open Information Extraction (OpenIE) offers a complementary approach by extracting structured information directly from unstructured text without needing a predefined schema. However, OpenIE results in a vast number of relations, often leading to redundancy and inconsistencies. To overcome this, we propose a novel approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for constructing a knowledge graph and for canonicalizing relations within it. Our method includes generating question-answer pairs from text, extracting triples from these pairs, and applying a two-step canonicalization process to ensure consistency and reduce redundancy. This paper presents our approach in detail, exploring related work, the construction of the knowledge graph, the canonicalization process, and the evaluation of our methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Canonicalization; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Open Information Extraction; Ontology; Canonicalization; Domain Specific; Economic Knowledge; Expert Knowledge; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Ontology-based; Open Information Extraction; Knowledge Graph","Ontology; Canonicalization; Domain specific; Economic knowledge; Expert knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Ontology-based; Open information extraction; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218928651"

The main contribution of the paper is a prompt pipeline tailored for domain-agnostic modeling, exemplified through the application to a domain-specific case study: the wine ontology. The resulting pipeline is used to develop NeOn-GPT, a workflow for automatic ontology modeling, and its proof of concept implementation, integrated on top of the metaphactory platform. NeOn-GPT leverages the systematic approach of the NeOn methodology and LLMs’ generative capabilities to facilitate a more efficient ontology development process. We evaluate the proposed approach by conducting comprehensive evaluations using the Stanford wine ontology as the gold standard. The obtained results show, that LLMs are not fully equipped to perform procedural tasks required for ontology development, and lack the reasoning skills and domain expertise needed. Overall, LLMs require integration with the workflow or trajectory tools for continuous knowledge engineering tasks. Nevertheless, LLMs can significantly alleviate the time and expertise needed.

Construction of knowledge graph of these data can provide knowledge for relevant staff in the maintenance process and assist them in decision-making, which is of great practical significance. Most of the existing EMU fault knowledge graph construction methods adopt supervised named entity recognition algorithms and relation extraction algorithms, which require a large amount of labeled data for training. To solve the above problems, a method for constructing EMU fault knowledge graph based on large language model is proposed. Firstly, the EMU fault ontology model is constructed based on the existing EMU fault data and drawing on the existing fault knowledge graph. Then the EMU fault triple is extracted by means of small samples using the in-context learning capability of the large language model. Finally, entity linking is performed based on the constructed fault ontology model to construct the EMU fault knowledge graph, and the graph is displayed in a visual way to guide the maintenance and diagnosis of EMU faults. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Emu Fault; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Ontology Model; Emu Fault; Fault Data; Faults Information; Graph-based; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Maintenance Process; Ontology Model; Treatment Measures; Knowledge Graph","EMU fault; Fault data; Faults information; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Maintenance process; Ontology model; Treatment measures; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218467029"

Our method presents these achievable and substitutable actions as a graph to give people various choices and help them make decisions. The proposed method extracts descriptions of actions from product review data using a large-scale language model and assigns action names. The relationship between action names is calculated based on graph computation and language patterns in web documents.

More and more systems use machine learning-based approaches, including large language models. The training and validation datasets are usually determined by the system developer and often a subset of the reference alignments are used. This sampling is against the OAEI rules and makes a fair comparison impossible. Furthermore, those models are trained offline (a trained and optimized model is packaged into the matcher) and therefore the systems are specifically trained for those tasks. In this paper, we introduce a dataset that contains training, validation, and test sets for most of the OAEI tracks. Thus, online model learning (the systems must adapt to the given input alignment without human intervention) is made possible to enable a fair comparison for ML-based systems.

This multi-party interaction often creates systematic ambiguities and biases from the elicitation of ontology requirements, which directly affect the design, evaluation and may jeopardise the target reuse. Meanwhile, current OE methodologies strongly rely on manual activities (e.g., interviews, discussion pages). After collecting evidence on the most crucial OE activities, we introduce OntoChat, a framework for conversational ontology engineering that supports requirement elicitation, analysis, and testing. By interacting with a conversational agent, users can steer the creation of user stories and the extraction of competency questions, while receiving computational support to analyse the overall requirements and test early versions of the resulting ontologies.

For the action commands, we have used an action robot ontology that we have defined in past work. We have extracted the pertinent classes and individuals and generated a three-word string for each action that is matched semantically with the user’s text.

While semantic descriptions in the form of semantic models and ontologies are indispensable to dataspaces, their full potential remains unexploited.

Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) offer inherent interpretability by constraining the final disease prediction on a set of human-understandable concepts. However, this inherent interpretability comes at the cost of greater annotation burden. Additionally, adding new concepts requires retraining the entire system. In this work, we introduce a novel two-step methodology that addresses both of these challenges. By simulating the two stages of a CBM, we utilize a pretrained Vision Language Model (VLM) to automatically predict clinical concepts, and an off-the-shelf Large Language Model (LLM) to generate disease diagnoses grounded on the predicted concepts. Furthermore, our approach supports test-time human intervention, enabling corrections to predicted concepts, which improves final diagnoses and enhances transparency in decision-making.

Recent advances in NLP have significantly improved information extraction capability across various domains. However, identifying patterns of alcohol consumption in medical documents remains underexplored, with existing approaches heavily relying on traditional NLP methods such as bag-of-words models that require extensive text preprocessing. These methods are often limited to English-language clinical settings, where robust medical ontologies and NLP toolkits are available to support preprocessing tasks. Therefore, this limitation hinders their use in multilingual healthcare settings and in environments lacking robust NLP toolkits to facilitate preprocessing. Motivated by the need for a more generalizable and accurate approach, this paper investigates the impact of large language models (LLMs) in advancing alcohol consumption pattern extraction from clinical notes. By reducing the need for manual preprocessing and improving adaptability to multilingual clinical notes, this work aims to enable broader, more practical applications of NLP models in extracting alcohol consumption patterns from clinical notes. By fine-tuning multilingual language models along with additional data sources, EILEEN effectively analyzes unstructured electronic health records (EHR) without relying on traditional concept normalization or extensive text preprocessing resources. Furthermore, the multi-modal component of EILEEN enables it to integrate and leverage diverse types of alcohol-related information, such as various types and amounts of alcohol consumed by a patient, thereby improving its pattern extraction accuracy. Our experiments, conducted in two different medical institutions in Korea, demonstrate that EILEEN significantly outperforms existing NLP methods in accurately identifying clinically relevant alcohol consumption patterns. By providing accurate, detailed, and clinically useful alcohol consumption patterns from unstructured clinical notes, EILEEN empowers healthcare practitioners with actionable insights essential for informed clinical decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alcohol Information Extraction; Clinical Informatics; Multilingual Transformers; Multimodal Learning; Natural Language Processing; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Alcohol Consumption; Alcohol Information Extraction; Clinical Informatics; Clinical Notes; Consumption Patterns; Language Processing; Multi-modal Learning; Multilingual Transformer; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Electronic Health Record","Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Alcohol consumption; Alcohol information extraction; Clinical informatics; Clinical notes; Consumption patterns; Language processing; Multi-modal learning; Multilingual transformer; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Electronic health record","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217581897"

Although it is significant for mathematical understanding, there is no unified view of functional thinking and how different aspects of the concept are used as a theoretical base. In this paper, we analyse different definitions used in empirical studies. First, we did a systematic research review resulting in 19 empirical studies focusing on functional thinking with an appropriate theoretical underpinning. The definitions were analysed using an AI tool. After that, we analysed the results using intrinsic mathematical properties of how functions can be defined in mathematics to identify core aspects of the definitions. According to the analysis, two definitions capture most of the key aspects of functional thinking, and most empirical studies use these key concepts. These two definitions treat functional thinking as products or products and processes. One definition used in one empirical study stands out by theoretically operationalizing functional thinking as a process. As such, different ontological assumptions are made in the studies; however, in some cases, having the same epistemological outcome. From a methodological point of view, the cosine similarity matrix was a useful tool for an ontological analysis, but a qualitative analysis is still needed to make meaning of it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cosine Similarity Matrix; Functional Thinking; Functions; Large Language Models; Ontological Analysis","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217473960"

State-of-the-art transfer learning is incapable of handling such zero-shot learning (ZSL) when defect labels are absent in training datasets. The latest research on ZSL leverages natural language processing (NLP) based on large language models (LLM) and shows promise by supplementing information to generate labels. However, its performance is hampered by the supporting LLMs pre-trained on generic vocabulary that failed to characterize manufacturing defects accurately. This paper establishes a methodology to automatically extract multi-level attributes from literature to improve defect representation, thereby facilitating ZSL. The extracted attributes contribute to a hierarchical knowledge graph, called defect ontology, to characterize multiple aspects of manufacturing defects. The proposed algorithm takes the defect images and associated text from the literature as input and develops an unsupervised method to identify the hierarchical relationships among the tokenized information extracted from the input text-feature corpora. The hierarchical graph is refined to retain the most relevant information by a pruning algorithm based on a minimum path search. A walk algorithm, along with NLP, parsed the generated ontology to create embedding of defects to enable zero-shot attribute learning to identify defects. The proposed method advances the ZSL methodology by automatically creating a hierarchical knowledge representation from literature and images to replace generic vocabulary in LLM adopted by ZSL algorithms, thus improving defect representation. The case studies are among the earlier attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of using literature data from public sources to extract attributes automatically to identify defects in a real additive manufacturing process based on direct-ink-writing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defect Identification; Manufacturing Automation; Self-supervised Learning; Zero-shot Learning; Gluing; Graph Embeddings; Knowledge Graph; Manufacturing Data Processing; Natural Language Processing Systems; Network Security; Ontology; Process Control; Self-supervised Learning; Semi-supervised Learning; Smart Manufacturing; Transfer Learning; Unsupervised Learning; Defect Identification; Hierarchical Knowledge; Labeled Data; Language Model; Language Processing; Manufacturing Automation; Manufacturing Defects; Natural Languages; Ontology Generation; Ontology's; Zero-shot Learning","Gluing; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Manufacturing data processing; Natural language processing systems; Network security; Ontology; Process control; Self-supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning; Smart manufacturing; Transfer learning; Unsupervised learning; Defect identification; Hierarchical knowledge; Labeled data; Language model; Language processing; Manufacturing Automation; Manufacturing defects; Natural languages; Ontology generation; Ontology's; Zero-shot learning","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217032682"

Recent approaches have attempted to integrate these steps into a single process using fully end-to-end architectures. Despite this, these integrated approaches have not yet matched the performance of language models, when applied to information extraction in plain text. In this paper, we introduce DANIEL (Document Attention Network for Information Extraction and Labelling), a fully end-to-end architecture integrating a language model and designed for comprehensive handwritten document understanding. DANIEL performs layout recognition, handwriting recognition, and named entity recognition on full-page documents. Moreover, it can simultaneously learn across multiple languages, layouts, and tasks. For named entity recognition, the ontology to be applied can be specified via the input prompt. The architecture employs a convolutional encoder capable of processing images of any size without resizing, paired with an autoregressive decoder based on a transformer-based language model. DANIEL achieves competitive results on four datasets, including a new state-of-the-art performance on RIMES 2009 and M-POPP for Handwriting Text Recognition, and IAM NER for Named Entity Recognition.

As connected IoT devices rank in billions, semantic interoperability remains one of the permanent challenges, where ontologies can provide a great contribution. The main goal of this paper is to analyze the state of research on semantic interoperability in well-being, aging, and health IoT services by using ontologies. This was achieved by analyzing the following research questions: “Which IoT ontologies have been used to implement well-being, aging and health services?” and “What is the dominant approach to achieve semantic interoperability of IoT solutions for well-being, aging and health?’ We conducted a scoping literature review of research papers from 2013 to 2024 by applying the PRISMA-ScR meta-analysis methodology with a custom-built software tool for an exhaustive search through the following digital libraries: IEEE Xplore, PubMed, MDPI, Elsevier ScienceDirect, and Springer Nature Link. By thoroughly analyzing 30 studies from an initial pool of more than 80,000 studies, we conclude that IoT ontologies for well-being, aging, and health services increasingly adopt Semantic Web of Things standards to achieve semantic interoperability by integrating heterogeneous data through unified semantic models. Emerging approaches, like semantic communication, Large Language Models Edge Intelligence, and sustainability-driven IoT analytics, can further enhance service efficiency and promote a holistic “One Well-Being, Aging, and Health” framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aging; E-health; Health; Internet Of Things (iot); Ontology; Scoping Literature Review; Semantic Interoperability; Semantic Web; Well-being","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215982835"

Often, this interaction occurs among unknown entities, making trust an essential requirement to overcome uncertainty in several aspects of this interaction. However, trust is a complex concept, and incorporating it in IoT is still a challenging topic. For this reason, it is highly significant to specify and model trust in early stages of the System Development Life Cycle (SDLC) of IoT-integrated systems, thus enhancing the aforementioned task. TrUStAPIS is a requirements engineering methodology recently introduced for incorporating trust requirements during IoT-based system design. The scope of this paper is to provide an extension of TrUStAPIS by introducing IoT trust semantics compatible with the W3C Web of Things (WoT) recommendations generated with the assistance of Large Language Models (LLMs). Taking advantage of LLMs as a tool for integrating and refining existing methodologies, in this paper we present our work towards a revision of the TrUStAPIS methodology.

Despite their potential, the adoption of these innovative methods is hindered by the construction industry’s fragmented expertise. Building Information Modeling (BIM) is frequently suggested to integrate this diverse knowledge, but existing BIM-based approaches lack a robust framework for systematically documenting and retrieving the cross-domain knowledge essential for construction projects. To bridge this gap, this paper presents an ontology-driven methodology for documenting and utilizing expert knowledge, with a focus on AM in construction. Based on a well-founded ontological framework, a set of modular ontologies is formalized for individual domains.

To reduce manual efforts in event ontology construction, several Event-Type Induction (ETI) methods were proposed to automatically find new event types from a given data source. Existing ETI methods utilize a corpus-based data source, and achieve the ETI goal via document clustering over pre-trained neural text embeddings. Most of the ETI methods require a semi-supervised setting to obtain a satisfactory result. In this paper, we improve ETI performance by incorporating graph-based data sources, which usually consists of event nodes, participant subjects/objects and the relational edges. Our motivation is that event type information learned from an event graph can complement that learned from text. This idea leads to the Graph-ETI (G-ETI) algorithm, where event clusters are initially identified from text embeddings and later refined through graph-based label propagation. Our algorithm naturally supports the unsupervised ETI setting where no event types are known beforehand. Moreover, we also provide an LLM-based naming module to generate appropriate names for the new event clusters. In the experiment, our method exhibits better event clustering performance compared to existing baselines, especially in the unsupervised setting. These improved clustering assignments combined with our LLM naming module can lead to high-quality ETI capability, which facilitates the event ontology construction process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Event Graph; Event Ontology Construction; Event-type Induction; Graph Algorithms; Graph Embeddings; Ontology; Data-source; Embeddings; Event Graphs; Event Ontology; Event Ontology Construction; Event Types; Event-type Induction; Induction Method; Ontology Construction; Performance; Semantics","Graph algorithms; Graph embeddings; Ontology; Data-source; Embeddings; Event graphs; Event ontology; Event ontology construction; Event Types; Event-type induction; Induction method; Ontology construction; Performance; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211910786"

Driven by evolutionary selection, an amino acid sequence is tailored to meet the required abundance of a proteome, underscoring the intricate relationship between sequence and functional demand. Yet, the specific role of amino acid sequences in determining proteome abundance remains elusive. Here we show that the amino acid sequence alone encodes over half of protein abundance variation across all domains of life, ranging from bacteria to mouse and human. With an attempt to go beyond predictions, we trained a manageable-size Transformer model to interpret latent factors predictive of protein abundances. Intuitively, the model's attention focused on the protein's structural features linked to stability and metabolic costs related to protein synthesis. To probe these relationships, we introduce MGEM (Mutation Guided by an Embedded Manifold), a methodology for guiding protein abundance through sequence modifications. We find that mutations which increase predicted abundance have significantly altered protein polarity and hydrophobicity, underscoring a connection between protein structural features and abundance. Through molecular dynamics simulations we revealed that abundance-enhancing mutations possibly contribute to protein thermostability by increasing rigidity, which occurs at a lower synthesis cost. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Explainable Machine Learning; Language Models; Molecular Dynamics; Protein Engineering; Protein Expression; Protein Sequence; Protein Stability; Proteome; Amino Acid; Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid; Mutant Protein; Nucleotide; Proteome; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Controlled Study; Correlation Analysis; Cost Benefit Analysis; Deep Learning; Explainable Machine Learning; Gene Ontology; Human; Hydrophobicity; Language Model; Molecular Dynamics; Nonhuman; Polarization; Prediction; Protein Degradation; Protein Domain; Protein Engineering; Protein Expression Level; Protein Function; Protein Metabolism; Protein Secondary Structure; Protein Stability; Protein Structure; Protein Synthesis; Proteomics; Random Forest; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Thermostability; Animal; Chemical Phenomena; Chemistry; Genetics; Metabolism; Mouse; Mutation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Humans; Hydrophobic And Hydrophilic Interactions; Mice; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutation; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Stability; Proteins","amino acid; mutant protein; nucleotide; proteome; protein; amino acid sequence; Article; controlled study; correlation analysis; cost benefit analysis; deep learning; explainable machine learning; gene ontology; human; hydrophobicity; language model; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; polarization; prediction; protein degradation; protein domain; protein engineering; protein expression level; protein function; protein metabolism; protein secondary structure; protein stability; protein structure; protein synthesis; proteomics; random forest; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; thermostability; animal; chemical phenomena; chemistry; genetics; metabolism; mouse; mutation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Humans; Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Interactions; Mice; Molecular Dynamics Simulation; Mutation; Protein Biosynthesis; Protein Stability; Proteins","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211575445"

Recent studies show that LLMs can be leveraged to perform lexical semantic tasks, such as Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) or Ontology Learning (OL). However, it has not effectively been verified whether their success is due to their ability to reason over unstructured or semi-structured data, or their effective learning of linguistic patterns and senses alone. This unresolved question is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where the lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has learned during its training stage. This paper investigates the following question: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the extraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses instead of reasoning? To answer this question and, we devise a controlled experiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English and gibberish terms. We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each corpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery. Empirical results show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs do not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and instead leverage senses and their frame. However, fine-tuning improves the performance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific terms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the applicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain Adaptation; Llms; Ontology Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated Learning; Latent Semantic Analysis; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Applications Domains; Domain Adaptation; Domain Specific; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Lexical Semantics; Natural Languages; Ontology Learning; Semantic Tasks; Domain Knowledge","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Federated learning; Latent semantic analysis; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Applications domains; Domain adaptation; Domain specific; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Lexical semantics; Natural languages; Ontology learning; Semantic tasks; Domain Knowledge","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211249904"

Our approach, Ontology-based Query Check (OBQC), is to check the LLM generated SPARQL query against the semantics specified by the ontology. A query will be flagged as incorrect and prevented from execution if it does not align with the ontological semantics. The study also explores the LLM’s capability in repairing a SPARQL query given an explanation of the error (LLM Repair). Our methods are evaluated using the chat with the data benchmark. The primary finding is our method further increases the accuracy overall by 21.59% thus pushing the overall accuracy level to 65.63%.

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly used for food recommendations due to their natural language processing capabilities. However, providing personalised and contextually relevant suggestions remains challenging because of the lack of a robust conceptualisation of healthy and sustainable food aligned with users’ dietary and lifestyle preferences. Ontologies can address this by offering a structured and semantically rich framework for organising information. In this paper, we propose a modular ontology to enhance the contextual knowledge of LLMs, enabling them to deliver personalised, contextually relevant food recommendations. The ontology’s modules are based on competency questions derived from a research project focused on sustainable and healthy food recommendations. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conducted experiments where ChatGPT-4 answered these competency questions with and without ontology integration. The answers were then assessed in a user study.

While MLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities, it is still unclear if they merely exploit statistical word co-occurrence or if they can capture a deeper, structured understanding of meaning, similar to how knowledge is organized in ontologies. This is a topic of increasing interest, with researchers seeking to understand how MLMs might internally represent concepts like ontological classes and semantic containment relations (e.g., sub-class and instance-of). Unveiling this knowledge could have significant implications for Semantic Web applications, but it necessitates a profound understanding of how these models express such relationships. This work investigates whether MLMs can understand these relationships, presenting a novel approach to automatically leverage the predictions returned by MLMs to discover semantic containment relations in unstructured text. We achieve this by constructing a verbalizer, a system that translates the model’s internal predictions into classification labels. Through a comprehensive probing procedure, we assess the method’s effectiveness, reliability, and interpretability. Our findings demonstrate a key strength of MLMs: their ability to capture semantic containment relationships.

They carefully document all phases for each product but analyses across products are challenging due to the heterogeneity and unstructured nature of the data in documents. In this paper, we propose a hybrid methodology that leverages Knowledge Graphs (KGs) in conjunction with Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract and validate data contained in these documents. We consider a case study focused on test data related to electronic boards for satellites. To do so, we extend the Semantic Sensor Network ontology. We store the metadata of the reports in a KG, while the actual test results are stored in parquet accessible via a Virtual Knowledge Graph. The validation process is managed using an LLM-based approach. We also conduct a benchmarking study to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs in executing this task. Finally, we analyze the costs and benefits of automating preexisting processes of manual data extraction and validation for subsequent cross-report analyses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Space Industry; Aerospace Industry; Benchmarking; Metadata; Semantics; Aerospace Manufacturing; Data Extraction; High Complexity; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Manufacturing Companies; Space Design; Space Industry; Test Data; Knowledge Graph","Aerospace industry; Benchmarking; Metadata; Semantics; Aerospace manufacturing; Data extraction; High complexity; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Manufacturing companies; Space design; Space industry; Test data; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211195122"

Traditional methods for HPO term extraction, such as PhenoTagger, often face limitations in coverage and precision. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate synthetic sentences with clinical context, which were semantically encoded into vector embeddings. These embeddings are linked to HPO terms, creating a robust knowledgebase that facilitates precise information retrieval. Our method circumvents the known issue of LLM hallucinations by storing and querying these embeddings within a true database, ensuring accurate context matching without the need for a predictive model. We evaluated the performance of three different embedding models, all of which demonstrated substantial improvements over PhenoTagger. Top recall (sensitivity), precision (positive-predictive value, PPV), and F1 are 0.64, 0.64, and 0.64, respectively, which were 31%, 10%, and 21% better than PhenoTagger. Furthermore, optimal performance was achieved when we combined the best performing embedding model with PhenoTagger (a.k.a. Fused model), resulting in recall (sensitivity), precision (PPV), and F1 values of 0.7, 0.7, and 0.7, respectively, which are 10%, 10%, and 10% better than the best embedding models. Our findings underscore the potential of this integrated approach to enhance the precision and reliability of HPO term extraction, offering a scalable and effective solution for biomedical data annotation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Phenotype Ontology; Phenotagger; Vector Embeddings","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85211050660"

However, the structural and semantic differences among these graphs necessitate training or fine-tuning a tailored model for each one. In this paper, we propose UniQ-Gen, a unified query generation approach to generate SPARQL queries across various knowledge graphs. UniQ-Gen integrates entity recognition, disambiguation, and linking through a BERT-NER model and employs cross-encoder ranking to align questions with the Freebase ontology. We conducted several experiments on different benchmark datasets such as LC-QuAD 2.0, GrailQA, and QALD-10. The evaluation results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance equivalent to or better than models fine-tuned for individual knowledge graphs. This finding suggests that fine-tuning a unified model on a heterogeneous dataset of SPARQL queries across different knowledge graphs eliminates the need for separate models for each graph, thereby reducing resource requirements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Kgqa; Large Language Models; Question Answering Over Knowledge Graphs; Sparql Generation; Query Languages; Question Answering; Semantics; Structured Query Language; Fine Tuning; Kgqa; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Query Generation; Question Answering; Question Answering Over Knowledge Graph; Sparql Generation; Structural Differences; Knowledge Graph","Query languages; Question answering; Semantics; Structured Query Language; Fine tuning; KGQA; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Query generation; Question Answering; Question answering over knowledge graph; SPARQL generation; Structural differences; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210886308"

The facts about decision problems and complexity classes are organised as a knowledge graph. The relationships between them are axiomatised using the FOWL framework that allows one to combine OWL 2 and first-order logic to balance between reasoning efficiency and expressive power. While the axioms were created through ontological analysis based on received ‘textbook knowledge’, the facts were extracted from the textual corpus of the ‘Complexity Zoo’ website, a human-curated ‘encyclopedia’ of complexity classes, in a human-supervised process employing large language models. We discuss, on the one hand, the modelling choices in relation to the previous work on knowledge representation in mathematics and, on the other hand, the peculiarities of using language models for the mining of complex symbolic facts. Finally, we illustrate some of the features of the hybrid reasoning system by providing a usage example. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Complexity; Domain Modelling; Knowledge Mining; Llm; Representation Of Mathematical Knowledge; Domain Knowledge; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Complexity Class; Domain Model; Knowledge Mining; Language Model; Llm; Mathematical Knowledge; Ontology's; Query Answering; Reasoning Tasks; Representation Of Mathematical Knowledge; Knowledge Graph","Domain Knowledge; Modeling languages; Ontology; Complexity class; Domain model; Knowledge mining; Language model; LLM; Mathematical knowledge; Ontology's; Query answering; Reasoning tasks; Representation of mathematical knowledge; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210875715"

Procedures are usually described by means of natural language texts, such as recipes or maintenance manuals, possibly spread across different documents and systems, and their interpretation and subsequent execution is often left to the reader. Representing such procedures in a Knowledge Graph (KG) can be the basis to build digital tools to support those users who need to apply or execute them. In this paper, we leverage Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities and propose a prompt engineering approach to extract steps, actions, objects, equipment and temporal information from a textual procedure, in order to populate a Procedural KG according to a pre-defined ontology. We evaluate the KG extraction results by means of a user study, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the perceived quality and usefulness of the LLM-extracted procedural knowledge.

However, hand-crafting these is not scalable, particularly due to the rate at which knowledge changes in many real-world applications. Partially automating the process of extracting and even modelling knowledge has therefore been a subject of research for many years. Nevertheless, accurate and reliable KG construction from natural language documents still remains a difficult task with many challenges, even in light of the impressive recent advances in language modelling. This paper focuses on one of those challenges, namely the extraction of accurate entity representations from text documents in order to facilitate relation extraction (RE). We present a novel method for generating document-contextualized input representations for entities using a masked language model (MLM) without the need for any sort of fine-tuning. These representations are then used as inputs to the same MLM that generated them, alleviating the need to include entire documents when prompting. Our results show that these representations 1) improve the ability of the MLMs BERT and RoBERTa to identify statements that represent correct relations between two entities; and 2) allow BERT to perform on par with the fine-tuned MLMs BioBERT and PubMedBERT. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Document-level Relation Extraction; Entity Embedding; Knowledge Graphs; Machine Reading; Masked Language Models; Graph Embeddings; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Document-level Relation Extraction; Embeddings; Entity Embedding; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge-based Systems; Language Model; Machine Reading; Masked Language Model; Ontology's; Relation Extraction; Knowledge Graph","Graph embeddings; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Document-level relation extraction; Embeddings; Entity embedding; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-based systems; Language model; Machine reading; Masked language model; Ontology's; Relation extraction; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210848015"

Yet, the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata’s infrastructure and automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata, we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include (a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction – requiring (minimal) manual validation – of conference metadata (e.g., acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs. Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data.

Here we evaluate five large language models (LLMs) for their ability to discover the common functions represented by a gene set, supported by molecular rationale and a self-confidence assessment. For curated gene sets from Gene Ontology, GPT-4 suggests functions similar to the curated name in 73% of cases, with higher self-confidence predicting higher similarity. Conversely, random gene sets correctly yield zero confidence in 87% of cases. Other LLMs (GPT-3.5, Gemini Pro, Mixtral Instruct and Llama2 70b) vary in function recovery but are falsely confident for random sets. In gene clusters from omics data, GPT-4 identifies common functions for 45% of cases, fewer than functional enrichment but with higher specificity and gene coverage. Manual review of supporting rationale and citations finds these functions are largely verifiable. These results position LLMs as valuable omics assistants. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Glucose 6 Phosphate; Glucose 6 Phosphate; Article; Cd8+ T Lymphocyte; Cell Differentiation; Cellular Stress Response; Differential Gene Expression; Energy Metabolism; Exocytosis; Functional Genomics; Gene Ontology; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; Generative Pretrained Transformer; Glucose Homeostasis; Glucose Metabolism; Glucose Transport; Homeostasis; Human; Ion Transport; Iron Homeostasis; Large Language Model; Neurotransmitter Release; Pentose Phosphate Cycle; Prompt Engineering; Protein Degradation; Protein Quality; Proteomics; Quality Control; Synapse Vesicle; T Lymphocyte Differentiation; Temperature; Transcriptomics; Ubiquitination; Wnt Signaling; Bioinformatics; Genetic Database; Genomics; Procedures; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Ontology; Genomics; Humans","glucose 6 phosphate; Article; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell differentiation; cellular stress response; differential gene expression; energy metabolism; exocytosis; functional genomics; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; generative pretrained transformer; glucose homeostasis; glucose metabolism; glucose transport; homeostasis; human; ion transport; iron homeostasis; large language model; neurotransmitter release; pentose phosphate cycle; prompt engineering; protein degradation; protein quality; proteomics; quality control; synapse vesicle; T lymphocyte differentiation; temperature; transcriptomics; ubiquitination; Wnt signaling; bioinformatics; genetic database; genomics; procedures; Computational Biology; Databases, Genetic; Gene Ontology; Genomics; Humans","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210471684"

Nevertheless, crafting these context models is a demanding task, both in terms of resources and expertise, often necessitating specialized knowledge from domain experts. This paper introduces an innovative approach, called LLMClean, for the automated generation of context models, utilizing Large Language Models to analyze and understand various datasets. LLMClean encompasses a sequence of actions, starting with categorizing the dataset, extracting or mapping relevant models, and ultimately synthesizing the context model. To demonstrate its potential, we have developed and tested a prototype that applies our approach to three distinct datasets from the Internet of Things, healthcare, and Industry 4.0 sectors.

Consequently, the need for timely disease recognition has become increasingly evident throughout the cultivation process. However, a major challenge lies in the limited expertise of farmers to identify diseases at an early stage. Furthermore, even if changes in crops are detected, there may be a lack of knowledge regarding appropriate remedies. Resorting to expert consultations for on-site assessments can be time-consuming, risking the widespread transmission of infectious diseases. In order to bridge the knowledge gap between experts and farmers, the utilization of a conversational agent, which can provide continuous multilingual personalized support, has emerged as a promising avenue. Thus, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of existing agricultural chatbots, detailing their architectural designs and methods for handling the required knowledge. Recognizing a significant gap between the requirements for a personalized multilingual chatbot for plant disease detection and existing solutions, the study proposes a hybrid model that integrates an ontology-based knowledgebase, open-source frameworks, and a large language model-based architecture to develop a more intelligent chatbot for detecting paddy diseases in Sri Lanka.

A wealth of relevant, untapped Mental Health (MH) data is available in online communities, providing the opportunity to address the explainability problem with substantial potential impact as a screening tool for both online and offline applications. Inspired by how clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage relevant clinical knowledge to classify and explain depression-related data, reducing manual review time and engendering trust. We developed a method to enhance attention in contemporary transformer models and generate explanations for classifications that are understandable by mental health practitioners (MHPs) by incorporating external clinical knowledge. We propose a domain-general architecture called ProcesS knowledge-infused cross ATtention (PSAT) that incorporates clinical practice guidelines (CPG) when computing attention. We transform a CPG resource focused on depression, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire (e.g. PHQ-9) and related questions, into a machine-readable ontology using SNOMED-CT. With this resource, PSAT enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations. Evaluation of four expert-curated datasets related to depression demonstrates PSAT's application-relevant explanations. PSAT surpasses the performance of twelve baseline models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross Attention; Depression; Explainable; Language Models; Mental Health; Phq-9; Diagnosis; Clinical Knowledge; Clinical Practice Guidelines; Cross Attention; Depression; Explainable; Health Data; Language Model; Mental Health; On-line Communities; Phq-9; Electronic Health Record; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Attention; Clinical Practice Guideline; Columbia Suicide Risk Severity Scale; Convolutional Neural Network; Cross Attention Approach; Depression; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Health Practitioner; Human; Human Experiment; Knowledge; Language Model; Long Short Term Memory Network; Mental Health; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Scoring System; Suicidal Ideation; Suicide; Suicide Attempt; Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine","Diagnosis; Clinical knowledge; Clinical practice guidelines; Cross attention; Depression; Explainable; Health data; Language model; Mental health; On-line communities; PHQ-9; Electronic health record; Article; artificial intelligence; attention; clinical practice guideline; columbia suicide risk severity scale; convolutional neural network; cross attention approach; depression; diagnostic test accuracy study; health practitioner; human; human experiment; knowledge; language model; long short term memory network; mental health; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; receiver operating characteristic; scoring system; suicidal ideation; suicide; suicide attempt; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207401106"

Although previous ontology- and word embedding-based approaches have made valuable contributions to the advancement of research proposal grouping, their practical utility has been limited due to a lack of consideration of funding agencies’ requirements. This study proposes a systematic approach for grouping research proposals that aligns with three common requirements: size, cannot-link, and must-link constraints. The proposed approach utilizes KLUE-RoBERTa for proposal vectorization and constrained K-means clustering for proposal grouping with size constraints. We introduce a proposal pre-partitioning and a proposal vector centralization to simultaneously consider the cannot- and must-link constraints in grouping proposals. An empirical analysis of 3,665 proposals submitted to the National Research Foundation of Korea demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed approach. Additionally, we conduct a comparative analysis of various combinations of methodological components to optimize this approach. The proposed approach is considered a valuable complementary tool for grouping proposals, enhancing the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the proposal evaluation system. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Constrained K-means Clustering; Contextualized Language Model; Funding Agency Requirements; Research Proposal Grouping; K-means Clustering; Cannot Links; Constrained K-mean Clustering; Contextualized Language Model; Funding Agencies; Funding Agency Requirement; K-means++ Clustering; Language Model; Must Links; Research Proposal Grouping; Research Proposals; Decentralized Finance","K-means clustering; Cannot links; Constrained K-mean clustering; Contextualized language model; Funding agencies; Funding agency requirement; K-means++ clustering; Language model; Must links; Research proposal grouping; Research proposals; Decentralized finance","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203014028"

We investigated the GPT-4o LLM from OpenAI which performed comparably with several groups of specially trained and supervised human annotators. The LLM achieves similar performance to humans, between 0.91 and 0.97 on zero-shot prompts without feedback to the LLM. Reviewing the disagreements between LLM and gold standard human annotations we note that actual LLM errors are comparable to human errors in most cases, and in many cases these disagreements are not errors. Based on the specific types of annotations we tested, with exceptionally reviewed gold-standard correct values, the LLM performance is usable for metadata annotation at scale. We encourage other research groups to develop and make available more specialized “micro-benchmarks,” like the ones we provide here, for testing both LLMs, and more complex agent systems annotation performance in real-world metadata annotation tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Document Annotation; Human Neuroimaging; Information Extraction; Large Language Models; Metadata Annotation; Ontologies; Text Mining","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014802944"

We present KEEP (Knowledge-preserving and Empirically refined Embedding Process), an efficient framework that bridges this gap by combining knowledge graph embeddings with adaptive learning from clinical data. KEEP first generates embeddings from knowledge graphs, then employs regularized training on patient records to adaptively integrate empirical patterns while preserving ontological relationships. Importantly, KEEPproduces final embeddings without task-specific axillary or end-to-end training enabling KEEP to support multiple downstream applications and model architectures. Evaluations on structured EHR from UK Biobank and MIMIC-IV demonstrate that KEEP outperforms both traditional and Language Model-based approaches in capturing semantic relationships and predicting clinical outcomes. Moreover, KEEP’s minimal computational requirements make it par ticularly suitable for resource-constrained environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Embeddings; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Graph; Medical Computing; Ontology; Semantics; Terminology; 'current; Clinical Data; Data-driven Methods; Embeddings; Graph-based; Knowledge Graphs; Machine-learning; Medical Ontology; Real-world; Trade Off; Economic And Social Effects","Graph embeddings; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Medical computing; Ontology; Semantics; Terminology; 'current; Clinical data; Data-driven methods; Embeddings; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Machine-learning; Medical ontology; Real-world; Trade off; Economic and social effects","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014744296"

Traditional Information Extraction (IE) models enable the transformation of textual data into structured formats (e.g., semantic triplets), facilitating efficient searches and uncovering hidden data insights. However, they require predefined ontologies and, often, extensive human efforts. On the other hand, Open IE tools extract information without any input knowledge, but they are limited in capturing entire and in-depth contexts. Furthermore, the state of the art presents a substantial discrepancy between the efforts carried out in English-centric methods and those in low-resource languages, such as Italian. Our study aims to address the aforementioned key challenges. To this end, we first define Open Named Information Extraction (ONIE), an approach that generalizes IE across diverse domains without requiring input ontologies and captures complex relationships. Then, we develop LLIMONIIE (Large Language Instructed Model for Open Named Italian Information Extraction), a novel end-to-end generative information extraction framework that leverages the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform ONIE from Italian documents, able to extract Named Entities and Open Relations uniformly. Furthermore, we devise an innovative dataset generation methodology to support our research. Finally, we release the code and dataset, contributing to the scientific community and the development of low-resource languages. Experiments demonstrate the potential of our proposal, achieving competitive results compared to the actual state of the art of Italian IE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information Extraction; Instruction Tuning; Large Language Models; Low Resource Language; Oie; Computational Linguistics; Knowledge Management; Ontology; Open Data; Semantics; Exponential Growth; Information Extraction; Instruction Tuning; Language Model; Large Language Model; Low Resource Languages; Oie; Ontology's; State Of The Art; Unstructured Documents; Information Retrieval","Computational linguistics; Knowledge management; Ontology; Open Data; Semantics; Exponential growth; Information extraction; Instruction tuning; Language model; Large language model; Low resource languages; OIE; Ontology's; State of the art; Unstructured documents; Information retrieval","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014455825"

It has received much attention over the last two decades, with prior studies focusing on digitizing and extracting the gazette’s ontologies to increase the gazette’s accessibility. However, the creation of a question answering system for the Sarawak Gazette, another avenue that could improve accessibility, has been overlooked. Objective: This study created a new system to generate answers for user questions related to the gazette using chatbot technology. Methods: This system sends user queries to a context retrieval system, then generates an answer from the retrieved contexts using a Large Language Model. A question answering dataset was also created using a Large Language Model to evaluate this system, with dataset quality assessed by 10 annotators. Results: The system achieved 55% higher precision, and 42% higher recall compared to previous state-of-the-art historical document question answering while only sacrificing 11% of cosine similarity. The annotators overall rated the dataset 2.9 out of 3. Conclusion: The system could answer the general public’s questions about the Sarawak Gazette in a more direct and friendly manner compared to traditional information retrieval methods. The methods developed in this study are also applicable to other Malaysian historical texts that are written in English.

These models typically depend heavily on extensive labeled datasets to achieve optimal performance. However, due to the limited availability of such high-quality labeled data, these models often exhibit weaker generalization abilities when applied to new, unseen data. Utilizing large language models, which possess stronger text comprehension abilities, for scientist attribute extraction can effectively reduce dependence on labeled data. However, the issue of ""hallucination"" in large language models affects their performance in this task. To address this issue, this paper firstly constructs an ontology for scientist attributes and designs prompt strategies. Subsequently, the idea of bounding box regression loss from object detection tasks is adopted to redefine the loss function for Fine-Tuning large models. This redefinition ensures a clear convergence direction when applying large models to scientist attribute extraction task, effectively reducing LLM hallucination and enhancing the accuracy of the attribute identification process. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that this novel methodology substantially enhances the efficacy of large models in scientist attribute extraction task. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Attribute Extraction; Instruction Supervised Fine-tuning; Large Language Models; Loss Function; Biographies; Deep Learning; Labeled Data; Learning Systems; Object Recognition; Tuning; Attributes Extractions; Fine Tuning; High Quality; Instruction Supervised Fine-tuning; Language Model; Large Language Model; Large Models; Loss Functions; Tuning Function; Extraction; Object Detection","Biographies; Deep learning; Labeled data; Learning systems; Object recognition; Tuning; Attributes extractions; Fine tuning; High quality; Instruction supervised fine-tuning; Language model; Large language model; Large models; Loss functions; Tuning function; Extraction; Object detection","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014290246"

The research constructs a Vector Spaces Model (VSM) from three aspects: spatial direction, spatial matrix, and spatial topics. First, based on the social structure of multimodal data, an interactive merging method was used to integrate the linear model and the chain model to construct an Innovation Ecological Chain (IEC) from scientific research to the market. Second, a distance matrix was constructed based on classification of data processing depth and technology maturity to measure the semantic distance on the ecological chain. Third, combined metadata and ontology with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to construct the spatial topic model, furthermore, the Large Language Model (LLM) utilizes in multimode data topic extraction. The experiments have shown that, 12 types of data from 1953 to 2023 in the Chinese highland barley can be obtained.

Traditionally, the task of crafting these competency questions heavily relies on the effort of domain experts and knowledge engineers which is often time-consuming and labor-intensive. With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs), there arises the possibility to automate and enhance this process. Unlike other similar works which use existing ontologies or knowledge graphs as input to LLMs, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach that uses LLMs for the automatic generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation metrics (precision and consistency), reveal that compared to zero-shot prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance of LLMs on generating CQs for concrete ontology engineering tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competency Questions; Llms; Ontology Engineering; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; Competency Question; Domain Experts; Domain Knowledge; Engineering Tasks; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology Development; Ontology Engineering; Ontology Evaluations; Performance; Ontology","Domain Knowledge; Knowledge graph; Competency question; Domain experts; Domain knowledge; Engineering tasks; Language model; Large language model; Ontology development; Ontology engineering; Ontology evaluations; Performance; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013955848"

Between inflationary and deflationary accounts, we pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in detail the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs to display their capacities, and the extensions used to turn LLMs into agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of embodied theories of mind: the individuality condition (it is not the product of its own activity, it is not even directly affected by it), the normativity condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals), and, partially the interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of its interaction with the environment). If not agents, then… What are LLMs? We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic automaton, a library-that-talks, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable to engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans, a “ghostly” component of the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological embodiment, LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus), digital extended interface embodiments, and resource-hungry computational embodiment, significantly transform existing forms of machine automatism and human agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency, the LLM-human coupling can produce midtended forms of agency, closer to the production of intentional agency than to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agency; Autonomy; Human Machine Interaction; Interlocutor Automata; Large Language Models; Transformers","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013749515"

The application of LLMs like DeepSeek-R1 in clinical laboratory medicine demonstrates potential for improving diagnostic accuracy, supporting decision-making, and optimizing patient care. Objective: This study evaluates the performance of DeepSeek-R1 in analyzing clinical laboratory cases and assisting with medical decision-making. The focus is on assessing its accuracy and completeness in generating diagnostic hypotheses, differential diagnoses, and diagnostic workups across diverse clinical cases. Methods: We analyzed 100 clinical cases from Clinical Laboratory Medicine Case Studies, which includes comprehensive case histories and laboratory findings. DeepSeek-R1 was queried independently for each case three times, with three specific questions regarding diagnosis, differential diagnoses, and diagnostic tests. The outputs were assessed for accuracy and completeness by senior clinical laboratory physicians. Results: DeepSeek-R1 achieved an overall accuracy of 72.9% (95% CI [69.9%, 75.7%]) and completeness of 73.4% (95% CI [70.5%, 76.2%]). Performance varied by question type: the highest accuracy was observed for diagnostic hypotheses (85.7%, 95% CI [81.2%, 89.2%]) and the lowest for differential diagnoses (55.0%, 95% CI [49.3%, 60.5%]). Notable variations in performance were also seen across disease categories, with the best performance observed in genetic and obstetric diagnostics (accuracy 93.1%, 95% CI [84.0%, 97.3%]; completeness 86.1%, 95% CI [76.4%, 92.3%]). Conclusion: DeepSeek-R1 demonstrates potential for a decision-support tool in clinical laboratory medicine, particularly in generating diagnostic hypotheses and recommending diagnostic workups. However, its performance in differential diagnosis and handling specific clinical nuances remains limited. Future work should focus on expanding training data, integrating clinical ontologies, and incorporating physician feedback to improve real-world applicability.

However, the unstructured nature of textual data poses significant hurdles that make the automatic extraction of terms from text a challenging task. Furthermore, while significant research efforts have been dedicated to term extraction from textual data, the incorporation of domain knowledge and context awareness as a way of enriching the extracted terms remains a challenge. To tackle these challenges, this study proposes an attention-based Deep Learning model for term extraction from text using the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) language model. The model uses (1) web scraping for term extraction from web pages, (2) BERT encoder for enriching term extraction through contextualization and cosine similarity to extract domain-specific terms and (3) WordNet for adding knowledge context and disambiguation through vocabulary labeling. The proposed system was applied to five different data samples from the horticulture domain and was evaluated with various metrics including accuracy, precision, and F1-score. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model improves the domain-specific term extraction and vocabulary labeling with an accuracy of 73%, a precision of 89%, a recall of 79%, as well as F1-Score of 84%, better than the related studies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Cosine Similarity Measure; Term Extraction; Vocabulary Building; Wordnet; Deep Learning; Domain Knowledge; Extraction; Intelligent Systems; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Text Processing; Websites; Bidirectional Encoder Representation From Transformer; Cosine Similarity Measures; Domain Specific; F1 Scores; Labelings; Learning Models; Term Extraction; Textual Data; Vocabulary Building; Wordnet; Signal Encoding","Deep learning; Domain Knowledge; Extraction; Intelligent systems; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Text processing; Websites; Bidirectional encoder representation from transformer; Cosine similarity measures; Domain specific; F1 scores; Labelings; Learning models; Term extraction; Textual data; Vocabulary building; Wordnet; Signal encoding","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013199652"

This paper systematically investigates the role of LLMs in dataspaces through a structured literature review, identifying five core tasks: data querying, visualization, augmentation, cleaning, and metadata enrichment. Our findings highlight that metadata enrichment-specifically semantic labeling and modeling-is a primary area where LLMs can improve interoperability by automatically generating structured and meaningful metadata. However, challenges such as hallucinations, inconsistent labeling, and limited domain adaptation persist, affecting their reliability in real-world applications. We discuss approaches to mitigate these limitations, including the integration of LLMs with knowledge graphs and domain ontologies.

Matching and integrating these assets, despite differences in semantic languages, ontologies, or schemas, is essential for building scalable and interoperable dataspaces. However, existing approaches often focus solely on semantic similarities, overlooking structurally similar assets from other domains that could be highly relevant. To address this gap, we present Graph and Contextual Embeddings for Heterogeneous Data Asset Matching (GC-DAM). GC-DAM employs two embedding strategies to match data assets based on both semantic and structural attributes. Structural (morphological) features are automatically incorporated into a knowledge graph, enabling the identification of assets that are structurally similar to a query but may originate from different domains, while metadata descriptions capture the semantic (contextual) features. This dual approach overcomes the limitations of methods that rely solely on semantic descriptions. We validate our approach against a custom dataset of 10,000 Kaggle data assets. Our multimodal embedding achieves 77% agreement on our custom dataset, demonstrating its ability to identify structurally similar assets across diverse domains, even when they are semantically different.

This paper examines the ontological status of such AI-generated recipes, arguing that neither recipe platonism nor recipe constructivism can fully account for them, as both rely on the existence of a prepared dish as a condition for validation. Yet, some AI-generated recipes are treated as successful, suggesting that their acceptance is not purely abstract, but rooted in embodied culinary knowledge. Drawing on Andrea Borghini’s concept of apprenticeship, I argue that recognising a recipe involves both abstract cognition within a type-token framework and sensory engagement through cooking and tasting. This analysis is supported by insights from Alva Noë and Matthew Ratcliffe, who conceptualise perception not as passive reception, but as a skilled and bodily situated mode of interaction with the world. Perceiving, in this sense, becomes a form of doing and touch and taste play a crucial role in how we validate recipes through practice. By shifting the focus from what is a recipe? to how do we recognise a recipe?, I propose a broader account that accommodates both human and AI contributions. Ultimately, recipe validity is not merely a matter of cognitive classification, but an experiential process grounded in sensory interaction, highlighting cooking as a vital mode of understanding recipe ontology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Authenticity; Culinary Epistemology; Embodied Knowledge; Multisensory Validity; Recipe Ontology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012840931"

Accurate annotation of protein functions is essential for advancing our understanding of biological systems and developing innovative biotechnological applications and therapeutic strategies. To predict protein function, researchers primarily rely on classical homology-based methods, which use evolutionary relationships, and increasingly on machine learning (ML) approaches. Lately, protein language models (PLMs) have gained prominence; these models leverage specialized deep learning architectures to effectively capture intricate relationships between sequence, structure, and function. We recently conducted a comprehensive benchmarking study to evaluate diverse protein representations (i.e., classical approaches and PLMs) and discuss their trade-offs. The current work introduces the Protein Representation Benchmark—PROBE tool, a benchmarking framework designed to evaluate protein representations on function-related prediction tasks. Here, we provide a detailed protocol for running the framework via the GitHub repository and accessing our newly developed user-friendly web service. PROBE encompasses four core tasks: semantic similarity inference, ontology-based function prediction, drug target family classification, and protein–protein binding affinity estimation. We demonstrate PROBE’s usage through a new use case evaluating ESM2 and three recent multimodal PLMs—ESM3, ProstT5, and SaProt—highlighting their ability to integrate diverse data types, including sequence and structural information.

It serves as an essential resource for both clinical practice and medical research. Approximately 40% of these relationships are of the is-a type, which is key to classifying concepts as subtypes or subclasses within broader categories and is fundamental for decision support systems and automated reasoning in clinical environments. Identifying is-a relationships in SNOMED CT is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of patient cohort queries, which form the backbone of clinical and research applications. Our study aims to use deep learning-based neural networks to determine whether a relationship between two concepts falls under the is-a or non-is-a categories. This approach can help detect misclassified or undefined is-a concept pairs, ultimately improving the quality of SNOMED CT ontology. We construct a node-edge-node structure for concept pairs and their relationships, which we then split into two categories: is-a and non-is-a classes. In this study, we propose two classification approaches. In the first approach using embeddingBag, the data are mapped into vector representations and used as input for a fully connected neural network to learn the patterns of the is-a relationship. During model training, 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.We achieved a precision of 0.903, recall of 0.894, and F1 Score of 0.898 in predicting the is-a relation among the associated medical concepts. The second approach involved transformer-based models like BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Devlin et al. [1], which dramatically advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks by offering deeply contextualized word embeddings. And RoBERTa(Robustly optimized BERT approach)[2], both BERT and RoBERTa models have significantly advanced the field of NLP. This work uses them as encoders connected to a classifier head to predict is-a or non-is-a categories. We fine-tune our models using a historical SNOMED CT dataset from 2017, while evaluation is carried out on new data introduced after 2023 in the 2024 release. With a recall of 0.933, precision of 0.933, F1 score of 0.932, accuracy of 0.933, and ROC of 0.972, RoBERTa outperforms the other baseline models (Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)) across all metrics.

While qualitative research methods are known to increase the depth and scope of information from respondents, only 5% of previous trait preference studies used qualitative data in their analyses. We show that AI-based natural language processing, particularly GPTs, is both a time and cost-effective mechanism for accurately analyzing open-ended trait preference data. This will contribute to the selection and prioritization of breeding targets to better meet end-user needs, with implications for food security and health outcomes globally. Summary: Crop trait preference research is critical for the development of improved crop varieties, guiding breeding programs in setting trait priorities and targets that represent farmers' and consumers' needs. However, there is a dearth of methodological harmonization in trait preference studies, leading to high heterogeneity in collected data and analysis frameworks, which constrains comparability between studies. Qualitative research tools using open-ended questions are among the most common methods used to elucidate crop trait preferences, but only a fraction of these data are used in analysis. The ascendance of AI tools in data analysis provides an opportunity to enhance capitalization of these data from open-ended question types. We use natural language processing (NLP) techniques, including generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models, to elucidate labels from open-ended question responses and perform multilabel text classification. We compare these labels to pre-codes from close-ended questions, as well as to existing crop trait ontology terms. We find that analyzing responses to open-ended questions using NLP leads to information gain, including an increase in diversity of traits and insight into their social functions. We conclude that using NLP-based approaches would allow breeding teams to extract trait terms from open-ended question responses efficiently and to compare these to both existing ontology terms and close-ended survey data.

They rely on digital communications and control systems, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. These attacks can disrupt grid operations and stability, compromise data, or cause physical damage to equipment. To address these challenges, it is essential to establish robust cybersecurity measures that meet and exceed existing industry standards. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive strategy to bolster the cybersecurity of IBRs through cutting-edge applications and technologies via a cybersecurity framework called 'CIBR-Fort', a knowledge-driven, interoperable, scalable, and manageable framework for modeling, analysis, and mitigation of cyber threats disrupting different components of IBR systems. Our knowledge-driven analysis consists of a fusion of knowledge graphs (KGs) in cybersecurity and the electric grid, achieved through link prediction leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and cosine similarity, attributed towards informed decision-making for threat mitigation. The evaluation results show how we can automate LLM-driven link prediction based on the fusion of two distantly separated ontologies, generating a dataset that can be used for scaling via graph learning that can be utilized for further security analyses of IBR systems. In addition, we show our knowledge-driven threat analysis can predict different attacks with 91.88% maximum accuracy. Lastly, we show how we can achieve real-time end-to-end threat mitigation with an average of 40 ms per traffic flow. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cybersecurity; Inverter-based Resources; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Models; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Control Systems; Cybersecurity; Digital Communication Systems; Electric Inverters; Electric Machine Control; Interoperability; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Network Security; Cyber Security; Inverter-based; Inverter-based Resource; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Modeling Analyzes; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Threats Analysis; Threats Mitigations; Forecasting","Control systems; Cybersecurity; Digital communication systems; Electric inverters; Electric machine control; Interoperability; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Network security; Cyber security; Inverter-based; Inverter-based resource; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Modeling analyzes; Retrieval augmented generation; Threats analysis; Threats mitigations; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012224579"

A significant part of medical data is currently generated and stored in an unstructured (textual) form. One way to process unstructured information is named entity recognition (NER). In the classical view, solving the NER problem within medical texts involves identifying objects or concepts that have a specific context related to the actions or events mentioned in the text. The National Unified Terminological System (NUTS) has been developed since 2022 based on international and federal medical thesauri and other sources. It can be used as the term set for solving problems of this type. At the time of the study, there was no available information in the scientific literature about tools solving NER problem in unstructured Russian-language medical texts. Aim: To develop a tool for extracting named entities from Russian-language medical texts. Material and Methods. Named entity recognition is performed using the NUTS as the terminological framework. The preprocessing pipeline includes full text segmentation, sentences tokenization and dependency parsing, words lemmatization and morphological analysis. The Annotation tool has been evaluated on clinical guidelines. The primary evaluation metric is the ratio of correctly identified terms to the total number of experts’ extracted terms. Results. As part of this study, the Annotation tool for medical texts has been developed. It is an automatized tool for extraction and categorization NUTS terms. This service is based on combined use large language models and rules. The Annotation tool can analyze texts in any language of the Indo-European group using any terminological system. The Annotation tool is hybrid and extracts automatically up to 93% of terms from the actual unstructured guidelines texts. The quality of this service is comparable to international NER tools for English-language texts: cTAKES with 91% accuracy and MetaMap with an F1-score of 88%. Conclusion. The article presents the Annotation tool-a hybrid service for named entity recognition within unstructured medical texts. The service was validated by extraction of NUTS terms in current clinical guidelines, with subsequent verification by medical experts. The obtained results demonstrate the promising potential of both this tool and the National Unified terminology system (NUTS). © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concept; Knowledge Base; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Ner; Nlp; Nuts; Ontology","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012154444"

However, a systematic evaluation of semantics-based prompting strategies for leveraging LMs in this context remains unexplored. This study investigates the effectiveness of different prompting techniques to enhance biomedical ontology alignment performance. We have developed a framework to support the design of LM-based queries to assess the semantic similarity between ontology classes. The framework interrogates the ontologies to align to extract relevant contextual information to inject into the LM prompts allowing the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).

Voice, text, and pictures affect knowledge transmission. Techniques for interpolating data may retain knowledge by determining semantic equivalents based on its context, the lesson, and connections without sacrificing data integrity. Knowledge has affected the security and privacy of data, showing vulnerability on every side of privacy and security violations with numerous legislation and standards. linguistic models convert voice impulses to digital data to examine phonological, prosodic, phonotactic, and lexical features. In contrast, embedding text in pictures and voice patterns modify word meaning via resolution, simplicity, and pitch adjustment. NLP uses vectors to detect word similarity, ensuring anonymity for ontology-based understanding with compatibility while deciphering control features. Using text-based semantic similarities analysis, visual text is classed by arrangement and topic. Every individual's linguistic dialect is distinct, with a tendency toward the local dialect. Due of rapid modifications to the environment, methods' acoustic qualities are difficult to transmit. Voice translating syllables might or might not communicate word feeling according to phonetical modification. A learnt variables taxonomy with prosody properties helps knowledge bases find relevant material without intermediary stages. For successful information transmission, integration, and edge manufacturing, edge learning requires context. An ontology of learnt connections from text, speech, and pictures shows information resemblance usefulness, and interest.

OntoCons transforms the ontology model construction problem into a knowledge tuple extraction problem, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of ontology model construction methods, and introduces subgraph encoding strategies to improve the accuracy of relation extraction.

Challenges such as insufficient domain knowledge, generic outputs, and hallucination are risks to their clinical adoption. This paper proposes an approach that integrates LLMs with Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) and medical ontologies to enhance personalized treatment recommendations. We compared four strategies to generate treatment recommendations with and without integrating clinical guidelines: (1) LLMs without any guideline input, (2) providing the full guideline document as textual input to LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technique; (3) converting guideline documents from PDF to markdown files capturing the structure of tables, diagrams, and references and using Chain-of-Thoughts to reason each decision steps; (4) structuring guidelines as graphs and linking medical concepts to ontologies as input to LLMs. We experimented on GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and Llama 2. The evaluations assessed guideline adherence, treatment completeness, path alignment, and answer relevancy with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia as the primary use case.

It highlights that statistics deals with structural relations in data regardless of what these data represent, whereas measurement establishes traceable empirical relations between the phenomena studied and the data representing information about them. These crucial epistemic differences are elaborated using Rosen's general model of measurement, involving the coherent modelling of the (1) objects of research, (2) data generation (encoding), (3) formal manipulation (e.g., statistical analysis) and (4) result interpretation regarding the objects studied (decoding). This system of interrelated modelling relations is shown to underlie metrologists' approaches for tackling the problem of epistemic circularity in physical measurement, illustrated in the special cases of measurement coordination and calibration. The article then explicates psychology's challenges for establishing genuine analogues of measurement, which arise from the peculiarities of its study phenomena (e.g., higher-order complexity, non-ergodicity) and language-based methods (e.g., inbuilt semantics). It demonstrates that psychometrics cannot establish coordinated and calibrated modelling relations, thus generating only pragmatic quantifications with predictive power but precluding epistemically justified inferences on the phenomena studied. This epistemic gap is often overlooked, however, because many psychologists mistake their methods' inbuilt semantics—thus, descriptions of their study phenomena (e.g., in rating scales, item variables, statistical models)—for the phenomena described. This blurs the epistemically necessary distinction between the phenomena studied and those used as means of investigation, thereby confusing ontological with epistemological concepts—psychologists' cardinal error. Therefore, many mistake judgements of verbal statements for measurements of the phenomena described and overlook that statistics can neither establish nor analyze a model's relations to the phenomena explored. The article elaborates epistemological and methodological fundamentals to establish coherent modelling relations between real and formal study system and to distinguish the epistemic components involved, considering psychology's peculiarities. It shows that epistemically justified inferences necessitate methods for analysing individuals' unrestricted verbal responses, now advanced through artificial intelligence systems modelling natural language (e.g., NLP algorithms, LLMs). Their increasing use to generate standardised descriptions of study phenomena for rating scales and constructs, by contrast, will only perpetuate psychologists' cardinal error—and thus, psychology's crisis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models (llms); Measurement; Metrology; Modelling Relation; Natural Language Processing (nlp); Psychometrics; Rating Scales; Semantics-syntax","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011346724"

However, the unstructured nature of this content poses significant challenges for extracting semantically rich insights. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the automated construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from social media discourse, specifically focusing on Twitter tweets. Our approach synergistically integrates large language models (LLMs), specifically a fine-tuned BERT model, with an ontology-driven framework. First, we define a detailed ontology of online communication concepts. The pre-trained BERT model is then fine-tuned using a multi-task learning approach on a curated dataset of anonymized and segmented Twitter discussions, thereby aligning its semantic representations with the predefined ontology. The fine-tuned LLM is leveraged for several critical tasks including entity and relation extraction, sentiment analysis, intention classification and the inference of contextual information and discussion styles. Furthermore, a mechanism is introduced to infer inter-user relationships and shared interests using graph neural networks (GNNs), analyzing patterns in interaction and language use. This multi-faceted extracted and inferred data is subsequently employed to build a knowledge graph, stored and queried via the Neo4j graph database management system. This study presents several contributions such as the integration of a ontology with an LLM method and the innovative user relationship and shared interest extraction using graph neural networks.

Using counts of ontology IDs in the PubMed Central (PMC) dataset as a surrogate for their prevalence in the biomedical literature, we examined the relationship between ontology ID prevalence and mapping accuracy. Results indicate that ontology ID prevalence strongly predicts accurate mapping of HPO terms to HPO IDs, GO terms to GO IDs, and protein names to UniProtKB accession numbers. Higher prevalence of ontology IDs in the biomedical literature correlated with higher mapping accuracy. Predictive models based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed this relationship. In contrast, this pattern did not apply to mapping protein names to Human Genome Organisation's (HUGO) gene symbols. GPT-4 achieved a high baseline performance (95 %) in mapping protein names to HUGO gene symbols, with mapping accuracy unaffected by prevalence. We propose that the high prevalence of HUGO gene symbols in the literature has caused these symbols to become lexicalized, enabling GPT-4 to map protein names to HUGO gene symbols with high accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in mapping ontology terms to low-prevalence ontology IDs and underscore the importance of incorporating ontology ID prevalence into the training and evaluation of LLMs for biomedical applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Human Phenotype Ontology; Large Language Models; Lexicalization; Machine Codes; Ontology Mapping; Uniprot Kb; Zipf's Law; Codes (symbols); Gene Ontology; Genes; Mapping; Systems Analysis; Terminology; Gene Ontology; Human Phenotype Ontology; Language Model; Large Language Model; Lexicalization; Machine Codes; Ontology Mapping; Ontology's; Uniprot; Uniprot Kb; Zipf Law; Medical Applications","Codes (symbols); Gene Ontology; Genes; Mapping; Systems analysis; Terminology; Gene ontology; Human phenotype ontology; Language model; Large language model; Lexicalization; Machine codes; Ontology mapping; Ontology's; Uniprot; Uniprot KB; Zipf Law; Medical applications","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011289811"

Competence in domain-specific terminology is the essential prerequisite for effective cross-linguistic communication in global business projects. The modern large language models (LLMs) based on the transformer architecture feature the limitations processing language for special purposes (LSP); thereby appealing to computational lexicography becomes necessary. In the AI era, ontology is a key lexicographic tool providing semantic precision within the certain domains. The linguistic competence of a specialist engaged in natural language text processing is the base for technical knowledge effective management, ensuring transformer adaptation to highly specialized contexts. The article is aimed to substantiate the reasonability of ontological approach application to machine processing of highly specialized texts in natural language. To achieve that aim several tasks shall be addressed: justification of ontological approach to the LSP at the present stage of the applied linguistics progress; description of essential properties of actual English oil and gas terminology; creation of oil and gas equipment ontology fragment using Protégé editor; processing of EN_RU technical text using the DeepSeek R1 transformer model considering the ontology fragment; presentation of the results in a comparative table format. The research material comprises the current terminology lexis functioning in English scientific and technical literature and oil and gas industry periodicals. Methodological basis includes terminology frame analysis procedure, ontology building method. The research results are practically significant for oil and gas translation projects: the ontology application in transformers ensures higher terminological accuracy in comparison with a basic model, providing LLMs adaptation to the technical terminology requirements. Thus, the ontological approach transforms translation procedures through the combination of technology innovation and linguistic expertise for deeper understanding of the technical lexis in specialized knowledge spreading. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lexicographic Automation; Oil And Gas Industry Terminology; Ontology; Terminology Management; Transformer Model","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011093374"

Existing methods often fall short. This paper presents BERT-OntoSent, a hybrid approach synergizing BERT's contextual power with ontology-based structured knowledge. We provide a detailed methodology where the DCWEB-SOBA process transforms text into (aspect, opinion, sentiment) triplets, populating a domain-specific BERT-OntoSent ontology used for fine-tuning BERT. SWRL rules within the ontology then refine BERT's predictions, enhancing robustness, particularly for negation and mixed sentiments, as formalized in our proposed refinement algorithm. We present a comprehensive evaluation demonstrating BERT-OntoSent's effectiveness not only on the SemEval 2016 restaurant benchmark but also across diverse domains, including product reviews (Amazon) and microblogs (Twitter). Our results consistently show significant improvements in accuracy and F1-score compared to BERT-only and ontology-only baselines across these datasets. Furthermore, we report on experimental optimizations for scalability, demonstrating practical performance gains.

The Medical Action Ontology (MAxO) provides a computational representation of treatments and other actions taken for clinical management. Currently, manual biocuration is used to annotate MAxO terms to rare diseases. However, it is challenging to scale manual curation to comprehensively capture information about medical actions for the more than 10 000 rare diseases. Results: We present AutoMAxO, a semi-automated workflow that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline MAxO biocuration. AutoMAxO first uses LLMs to retrieve candidate curations from abstracts of relevant publications. Next, the candidate curations are matched to ontology terms from MAxO, Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO), and MONDO disease ontology via a combination of LLMs and post-processing techniques. Finally, the matched terms are presented in a structured form to a human curator for approval. We used this approach to process abstracts related to 37 rare genetic diseases and identified 958 novel treatment annotations that were transferred to the MAxO annotation dataset. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010857151"

While large language models have shown promise in medical applications, their optimal application for trustworthy and accurate gene prioritization downstream of modern prioritization tools has not been systematically evaluated. Results We benchmarked various language models for gene prioritization using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology classification approaches to categorize patient cases by phenotype-based solvability levels. To address language model limitations in ranking large gene sets, we implemented a divide-and-conquer strategy with mini-batching and token limiting for improved efficiency. GPT-4 outperformed other language models across all patient datasets, demonstrating superior accuracy in ranking causal genes. Multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology classification approaches effectively distinguished between confidently-solved and challenging cases. However, we observed bias toward well-studied genes and input order sensitivity as notable language model limitations. Our divide-and-conquer strategy enhanced accuracy, overcoming positional and gene frequency biases in literature. This framework optimized the overall process for identifying disease-causal genes compared to baseline evaluation, better enabling targeted diagnostic and therapeutic interventions and streamlining diagnosis of rare genetic disorders.

However, these systems face significant challenges, including overreliance on manual expert intervention, limited handling of heterogeneous textual data, etc. The Description-Detection Framework (DDF) addresses some of these limitations by leveraging PropaPhen (Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology), UMLS, and OpenStreetMaps to detect suspicious health-related cases using spatiotemporal and textual data. However, DDF is restricted to detection and lacks the ability to classify the detected observations into meaningful categories. To adress this limitation, we propose to enhance DDF by incorporating a clustering-based classification process. This enhancement employs BioSTransformers, a pretrained biomedical language model built on Sentence Transformers trained on PubMed data, to compute semantic similarity between observations. By capturing domain-specific semantic relationships, BioSTransformers enables clustering that integrates biological semantics with spatiotemporal context, outperforming traditional methods from the literature in observation classification. Our proposed approach reduces the dependency on manual expert effort, improves the system's ability to process heterogeneous data, and enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of case classification. The results demonstrate the potential of this method to advance EBS systems, providing a scalable and automated solution to public health surveillance challenges. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Language Models; Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology; Description Detection Framework; Public Health Surveillance; Spatiotemporal Reasoning; Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Health Risks; Natural Language Processing Systems; Public Health; Security Systems; Semantics; Biomedical Language Model; Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology; Description Detection Framework; Detection Framework; Event-based; Language Model; Ontology's; Public Health Surveillances; Spatio-temporal Reasoning; Surveillance Systems; Ontology","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Health risks; Natural language processing systems; Public health; Security systems; Semantics; Biomedical language model; Core propagation phenomenon ontology; Description detection framework; Detection framework; Event-based; Language model; Ontology's; Public health surveillances; Spatio-temporal reasoning; Surveillance systems; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010645286"

While BIM provides detailed 3D visualizations of building components, schematic drawings remain crucial for capturing the logical and functional relationships within early-stage designs. However, discrepancies between these two representations often arise, necessitating extensive manual verification. This study introduces a conceptual framework for automated cross-validation between MEP schema drawings and BIM models by leveraging semantic representations. The framework utilizes AI-driven technologies, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to extract structured knowledge from both schematics and BIM data, translating this information into machine-readable formats based on the Brick ontology. By integrating semantic web technologies and multimodal processing, the proposed framework effectively identifies inconsistencies in airflow distribution, system connectivity, and performance parameters. This approach significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of design validation, minimizes data discrepancies, and fosters interoperability among heterogeneous data sources.

The approach circumvents the need for extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, thereby enabling rapid development and deployment in a domain characterized by data scarcity. The methodology begins with the construction of a knowledge graph, which involves a comprehensive ontology design, followed by knowledge extraction from unstructured text sources, and culminates in knowledge representation and storage in a structured format. Subsequently, the framework facilitates dynamic risk understanding and analysis, encompassing risk factor identification, risk event inference, and the analysis of complex relationships between these elements, all supported by the structured knowledge base. Finally, the system provides knowledge-based risk interpretation and decision-making support, generating explanations for risk events, assessing their potential impacts, and offering actionable recommendations to stakeholders. By employing carefully crafted prompts and the inherent natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4, the framework facilitates the extraction of entities and relationships from unstructured textual data, effectively populating the knowledge graph. This knowledge graph, representing entities, attributes, and relationships pertinent to cross-border pipeline risks, serves as a foundation for dynamic risk assessment. This method presents a scalable, data-efficient approach tailored to the specialized domain of cross-border pipeline risk management, particularly advantageous in contexts with limited resources. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of LLMs, specifically GPT-4, in conjunction with knowledge graph methodologies, to advance risk management practices in complex, data-sparse domains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","China-russia Pipeline; Knowledge Graph; Llm; Data Mining; Decision Making; Digital Storage; Domain Knowledge; Extraction; Graph Theory; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Pipelines; Risk Analysis; Risk Management; China-russia Pipeline; Cross-border; Domain-specific Knowledge; Dynamic Assessment; Early Warning; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Learning Capabilities; Risk-based; Risk Assessment","Data mining; Decision making; Digital storage; Domain Knowledge; Extraction; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Pipelines; Risk analysis; Risk management; China-russia pipeline; Cross-border; Domain-specific knowledge; Dynamic assessment; Early warning; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Learning capabilities; Risk-based; Risk assessment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010558936"

The integration of Ontology and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a transformative approach for enhancing recommender systems by improving contextual intelligence, personalization, and explainability. Traditional recommendation algorithms often suffer from data sparsity, cold-start problems, and limited semantic understanding, which hinder their ability to deliver highly relevant and interpretable suggestions. This research provides an exhaustive exploration of how ontology-driven knowledge representation can be seamlessly combined with LLMs to refine user-item interactions, enrich embeddings, and improve reasoning in recommendation pipelines. We propose a hybrid framework where ontological structures encode domain-specific relationships while LLMs process, infer, and enhance recommendations through contextual embeddings.This synergy enables semantic-aware recommendations, explainable item suggestions, and adaptive learning mechanisms that adjust based on user behavior and external context. Furthermore, we investigate novel ontology injection techniques, including knowledge graph-based reinforcement, to improve long-tail item exposure and enhance recommendation diversity. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world datasets, we demonstrated how ontology-LLM fusion significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy, novelty, and interpretability. This study establishes a foundation for the next generation of context-aware, knowledge-enhanced recommender systems that leverage LLMs for reasoning and ontologies for structured knowledge representation, paving the way for more intelligent and user-centric recommendations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Intelligence; Context-aware Recommendation Systems; Llm; Ontology; Semantic-aware; Behavioral Research; Electronic Commerce; Electronic Trading; Embeddings; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Representation; Recommender Systems; Semantics; User Interfaces; Context-aware Recommendation Systems; Context-aware Recommender Systems; E- Commerces; In Contexts; Knowledge-representation; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Semantic-aware; Ontology","Behavioral research; Electronic commerce; Electronic trading; Embeddings; Graphic methods; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Recommender systems; Semantics; User interfaces; Context-aware recommendation systems; Context-aware recommender systems; E- commerces; In contexts; Knowledge-representation; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Semantic-aware; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010522965"

However, accurately predicting protein function remains a longstanding challenge in computational biology, especially for non-model organisms. Traditional methods based on sequence similarity often fail to annotate a significant proportion of proteins. The emergence of protein language models has significantly improved this process, enabling more accurate and comprehensive functional annotation. In this work, we highlight how the ProtTrans language model outperforms other tools in per-protein annotation, offering a more precise approach to predicting protein function. We also introduce functional annotation based on embedding space similarity (FANTASIA; available at https://github.com/MetazoaPhylogenomicsLab/FANTASIA), a tool developed to harness these advances for large-scale annotation of uncharacterized proteomes. We provide a detailed overview of how to use FANTASIA, interpret its outputs, and demonstrate its utility in three case studies: (a) enrichment analyses from transcriptomics data, (b) assigning novel functions to unannotated genes in model organisms, and (c) identifying genes involved in important functions in non-model organisms. These results demonstrate the potential of protein language models to advance functional annotation in diverse biological contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Biology; Fantasia; Protein Function Prediction; Protein Language Models; Proteome Annotation; Protein; Proteins; Proteome; Isoprotein; Proteome; Protein; Adult; Annelid; Bioinformatics; Caenorhabditis Elegans; Comparative Genomics; Comparative Study; Controlled Study; Differential Gene Expression; Drosophila Melanogaster; Functional Genomics; Gene Ontology; High Throughput Analysis; K Nearest Neighbor; Language Model; Machine Learning; Nonhuman; Prediction; Protein Function; Protein Language Model; Prottrans Model; Rna Sequencing; Transcriptomics; Animal; Genetics; Human; Metabolism; Molecular Genetics; Procedures; Protein Database; Proteomics; Software; Animals; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Software","isoprotein; proteome; protein; adult; annelid; bioinformatics; Caenorhabditis elegans; comparative genomics; comparative study; controlled study; differential gene expression; Drosophila melanogaster; functional genomics; gene ontology; high throughput analysis; k nearest neighbor; language model; machine learning; nonhuman; prediction; protein function; protein language model; prottrans model; RNA sequencing; transcriptomics; animal; genetics; human; metabolism; molecular genetics; procedures; protein database; proteomics; software; Animals; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Humans; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins; Proteome; Proteomics; Software","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010291591"

This challenge contributes to a gap, where many proteins have known sequences, predicted structures, and other crucial information, yet lack functional annotations. This gap underscores the critical importance of automated function prediction (AFP) methods, which aim to develop computational techniques dedicated to predicting protein functions. Most AFP methods leverage the wealth of diverse protein information available, such as sequences, structures, protein-protein interactions, and domain characteristics. These methods often utilize individual features or integrate multiple features to enhance the accuracy of function prediction. In this chapter, we focus on TransFun, a structure-based protein function prediction technique. TransFun leverages the embeddings provided by the ESM-1b pretrained protein language models to distill intricate sequence features and combines them with AlphaFold’s predicted structures to predict protein functions.

However, existing knowledge resources in this domain are fragmented, heterogeneous, and largely unstructured, causing decision-makers to rely heavily on intuition or scattered textual materials, which often results in delayed, inconsistent, or suboptimal emergency responses. To address these challenges, this study proposes a structured framework integrating large language models (LLMs) with knowledge representation techniques to systematically construct domain-specific knowledge graphs (KGs) tailored explicitly for earthquake emergency scenarios. The framework comprises three primary stages: (1) developing an ontology that encompasses the complete earthquake emergency management cycle–prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery–as well as earthquake-specific measures, models, terminology, and attributes; (2) guiding LLMs with structured prompts to extract entities, relationships, and attributes from unstructured data; and (3) employing a knowledge fusion strategy to resolve ambiguities and consolidate information across the graph. From a corpus of 2682 professional documents, including emergency plans, technical standards, and specialized books, the framework extracted 284,801 entities and over 80,000 unique relationship types, subsequently consolidated into approximately 1000 meaningful categories. The final KG, refined through entity fusion and clustering, comprises over 268,000 nodes and 833,000 relationships. To effectively utilize the constructed KG, we developed an Improved Hybrid Retrieval-Augmented Generation (HybridRAG) application framework, integrating symbolic retrieval from the KG with semantic similarity-based retrieval from a vector database. This dual retrieval approach enables LLMs to generate responses that are both semantically coherent and deeply grounded in operational knowledge. Comparative experiments conducted on a newly constructed dataset of 150 earthquake-specific questions demonstrated that the Improved HybridRAG method significantly outperforms standard methods–including LLM-only, semantic vector-based retrieval, and purely symbolic retrieval–in accuracy, clarity, comprehensiveness, conciseness, and relevance. These findings validate the advantage of combining structured and semantic knowledge retrieval, illustrating the framework’s capability to provide reliable, contextually aligned, and actionable insights for decision-makers in earthquake emergency scenarios. Future work will focus on improving attribute completeness, refining entity alignment techniques to capture complex semantic nuances, and exploring multimodal data integration to further extend the KG’s utility. This study underscores the potential of systematically combining structured KGs and LLMs to significantly enhance decision-making capabilities in disaster management contexts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earthquake Disaster Management; Emergency; Knowledge Enhancement; Knowledge Fusion; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Models (llm)","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009902479"

However, new issues in the building domain, such as predicting the presence of lead in buildings, renovating asbestos floors, or the reuse and recycling of components or parts of buildings as part of the circular economy, require a generalization of this ontology to a building ontology. The lack of relevant data tends to make decision-making difficult. The purpose of our approach is to show how instance-level knowledge graphs can be populated without having to manually create hundreds of instances using large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering. This paper introduces a novel method for populating ontologies using the latest generative LLMs, such as GPT-3.5. Our method is characterized by an innovative recursive zero-shot prompting technique. The key contributions of this study are: (i) a new strategy for recursively prompting LLMs to elicit pertinent knowledge from the asbestos application domain; (ii) ontology population informed by the ontology metamodel; and (iii) formalization of the results into OWL axioms for the automatic integration of new instances. To evaluate the efficacy of our approach, we employed two main methodologies: (1) querying for instances linked to each entity; and (2) recursively querying for instances to leverage our recursive prompting strategy. Our initial strategy focused on evaluating the effectiveness of zero-shot prompting in retrieving relevant values for entities and data properties.

There’s still a shortage of tools that can democratize knowledge graph (KG) creation, something that is increasingly needed—firstly by educators trying to discuss examples with novices without stumbling on OWL jargon at the earliest step, but also for more recent integration cases such as (i) GraphRAG, where private KGs are called to augment or ensure factuality of large language model services; or (ii) in search engine optimization (SEO), where SEO practitioners lacking knowledge engineering background must embed Schema.org graph data into their Web content. Most visual KG tools are visualizers of KGs created by other means—either in OWL-centric ontology editors posing high expertise barriers, or converted from available serializations, or lifted from legacy data sources. The few actual KG editors are mostly OWL editors neglecting to support the creation of schemaless graph datasets as well as of flexible combinations of graph data and schema fragments. This paper reports on a Design Science effort adopting metamodeling means, traditionally employed for the engineering of domain-specific modeling languages, toward defining a KG development and integration method that facilitates both the visual design of KG exemplars and their operationalization. We aim to balance a diagrammatic look and feel with machine readability of the semantic content being produced—further streamlined in an architecting proposition for integration with LLM services and for the production of Schema.org graph snippets.

The analysis demonstrates that these metrics provide distinct yet complementary perspectives on semantic evaluation, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the natural language understanding capabilities of LLMs. Through this approach, we demonstrate that modern LLMs exhibit sophisticated abilities in integrated syntax and semantics processing by utilizing distributed representations where both types of information coexist within high-dimensional vector spaces.

Due to the heterogeneity of the underlying graph schema, topology and assertions, most KGQA systems cannot be transferred to unseen Knowledge Graphs (KGs) without resource-intensive training data. We present OntoSCPrompt, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based KGQA approach with a two-stage architecture that separates semantic parsing from KG-dependent interactions. OntoSCPrompt first generates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT, ASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with KG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we present an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG ontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and continuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies to ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both stages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as SOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ, WebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well to unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG 11Code: https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generalization; Kgqa; Llm; Qa; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Transfer; Learning Systems; Ontology; Query Processing; Question Answering; Dbpedia; Generalisation; Knowledge Graph Question Answering; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Qa; Question Answering; Specific Knowledge; Semantics","Knowledge graph; Knowledge transfer; Learning systems; Ontology; Query processing; Question answering; Dbpedia; Generalisation; Knowledge graph question answering; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; QA; Question Answering; Specific knowledge; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009456479"

Traditional OM approaches often lack real-time, context-aware decision support, efficient resource allocation, and multi-agent collaboration, essential for dynamic optimization strategies. Integrating Stackelberg game theory models into OM enhances resource allocation and scheduling through hierarchical decision-making, allowing a leader-follower to optimally distribute resources while providing data-rich visualization and supporting adaptive, strategic planning in maintenance management. In dynamic multi-agent environments with multiple stakeholders, achieving Nash equilibrium leads to stable and efficient resource allocation, as no participant can unilaterally improve their outcome without impacting others. By incorporating Stackelberg game dynamics, Nash equilibrium concepts, and AR, the conceptual framework facilitates structured strategic planning, balancing leadership-driven optimization with equilibrium-based stability in decision-making and visualization. Evaluation of this ontology is proposed through a case study in a laboratory setting. The proposed ontology serves as a knowledge base for improving decision-making and provides a replicable framework for future advancements in industrial maintenance management by enabling the integration of emerging technologies, such as foundation models and large language models (LLMs), to refine maintenance strategies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ar Decision-making; Game Theory; Ontology; Opportunistic Maintenance; Behavioral Research; Computation Theory; Data Visualization; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Decision Theory; Information Analysis; Information Management; Information Use; Knowledge Based Systems; Maintenance; Multi Agent Systems; Nash Equilibrium; Resource Allocation; Strategic Planning; Visualization; Augmented Reality Decision-making; Decisions Makings; Efficient Resource Allocation; Game Theory Models; Maintenance Management; Maintenance Strategies; Nash Equilibria; Ontology's; Opportunistic Maintenance; Stackelberg Games; Game Theory; Ontology","Behavioral research; Computation theory; Data visualization; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; Information analysis; Information management; Information use; Knowledge based systems; Maintenance; Multi agent systems; Nash equilibrium; Resource allocation; Strategic planning; Visualization; Augmented reality decision-making; Decisions makings; Efficient resource allocation; Game theory models; Maintenance management; Maintenance strategies; Nash equilibria; Ontology's; Opportunistic maintenance; Stackelberg Games; Game theory; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009411442"

It is a comprehensive archive that enables searches of experiments, regardless of type. However, there is substantial variability in the submitted metadata due to the difficulty in defining comprehensive rules for describing them and the limited user awareness of best practices in creating them. This inconsistency poses considerable challenges to the findability and reusability of archived data. Given the scale of BioSample, which hosts over 40 million records, manual curation is impractical. Automatic rule-based ontology mapping methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their effectiveness is limited by the heterogeneity of the metadata. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have gained attention in natural language processing and are promising tools for automating metadata curation. In this study, we evaluated the performance of LLMs in extracting cell line names from BioSample descriptions using a gold-standard dataset derived from ChIP-Atlas, a secondary database of epigenomics experiment data in which samples were manually curated. The LLM-assisted methods outperformed traditional approaches, achieving higher accuracy and coverage. We further extended them to extract information about experimentally manipulated genes from metadata when manual curation had not yet been applied in ChIP-Atlas. This also yielded successful results, including the facilitation of more precise filtering of the data and the prevention of possible misinterpretations caused by the inclusion of unintended data. These findings underscore the potential of LLMs in improving the findability and reusability of experimental data in general, which would considerably reduce the user workload and enable more effective scientific data management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Data Curation; Biological Sample; Large Language Model; Article; Awareness; Best Practice; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; Data Base; Epigenetics; Filtration; Human; Information Processing; Large Language Model; Metadata; Natural Language Processing; Nonhuman; Prevention; Usability; Workload; Bioinformatics; Data Mining; Factual Database; Procedures; Computational Biology; Data Curation; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Humans; Large Language Models; Metadata; Natural Language Processing","article; awareness; best practice; chromatin immunoprecipitation; data base; epigenetics; filtration; human; information processing; large language model; metadata; natural language processing; nonhuman; prevention; usability; workload; bioinformatics; data mining; factual database; procedures; Computational Biology; Data Curation; Data Mining; Databases, Factual; Humans; Large Language Models; Metadata; Natural Language Processing","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009294611"

At the same time, there has been demonstrated a significant potential of joining LLM and RL agents in a single pipeline. Memory is the central component of multi-agent pipelines, both in learning and inference: it stores long-term experience, agents’ transactions in the working memory, other learning artifacts. However, given a plethora of protocols, environments, and experience representations, the challenge is to implement interpretable decision-making between RL agents (neural layer), and LLM agents (symbolic) in working memory, and experience transfer in the long run. Driven by the idea that agents should be able to collaborate autonomously, and learn how to use, transfer, and synthesize new knowledge and processes, we propose a graph-based memory model, which can be shared and reused by both RL and LLM agentic teams on any representation level. This memory model is a collection of RDF graphs, allowing for neural and symbolic representations at the same time, and providing interoperability and explainability of knowledge graphs. In the current paper, we introduce the MATRIX ontology (Multi-Agent Experience Transfer, Reasoning and Interaction eXchange), a conceptualization behind the shared memory layer, that can serve as a memory, decision, and experience model for heterogeneous agentic teams, and show its applications in different use cases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Experience Transfer Between Neuro-symbolic Agents; Knowledge Graphs For Shared Memory Representation; Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning; Ontology For Multi-agent Experience Transfer; Semantic Memory For Multi-agent Teams; Autonomous Agents; Decision Making; Graph Theory; Intelligent Agents; Matrix Algebra; Memory Architecture; Multi Agent Systems; Neural Networks; Reinforcement Learning; Semantic Web; Semantics; Transfer Learning; Experience Transfer Between Neuro-symbolic Agent; Knowledge Graph For Shared Memory Representation; Knowledge Graphs; Multi Agent; Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning; Multiagent Teams; Ontology For Multi-agent Experience Transfer; Ontology's; Semantic Memory; Semantic Memory For Multi-agent Team; Shared Memory; Symbolic Agents; Ontology","Autonomous agents; Decision making; Graph theory; Intelligent agents; Matrix algebra; Memory architecture; Multi agent systems; Neural networks; Reinforcement learning; Semantic Web; Semantics; Transfer learning; Experience transfer between neuro-symbolic agent; Knowledge graph for shared memory representation; Knowledge graphs; Multi agent; Multi-agent reinforcement learning; Multiagent teams; Ontology for multi-agent experience transfer; Ontology's; Semantic memory; Semantic memory for multi-agent team; Shared memory; Symbolic agents; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009229875"

Current techniques face significant challenges due to syntactical and structural heterogeneity. To address this, matching techniques often employ semantic similarity to identify correspondences. Traditional semantic matchers, however, rely on ontology matching tools or lexical databases, which often struggle when metamodels use different terminologies or hierarchical structures. Inspired by the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper explores the capability of GPT-4 potentials as a semantic matcher and alternative to existing methods for metamodel matching. However, metamodels can be large, which can overwhelm LLMs if provided in a single prompt, leading to reduced accuracy. Therefore, we propose prompting LLMs with fragments of the source and target metamodels, identifying correspondences through an iterative process. The fragments to be provided in the prompt are identified based on an initial mapping derived from their elements' definitions. Through experiments with 10 metamodels, our results show that our LLMbased approach improves the accuracy of metamodel matching, achieving an average F-measure of ≈ 91%, outperforming both the baseline and hybrid approaches, which have a maximum average F-measure of ≈ 29% and ≈ 74%, respectively. Moreover, our approach surpasses single-prompt LLM-based matching, which has an average F-measure of 80%, by approximately 11%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain-specific Languages; Metamodel Matching; Model Migration; Model-driven Engineering; Computational Linguistics; Iterative Methods; Latent Semantic Analysis; Ontology; Software Engineering; Terminology; Domains Specific Languages; F Measure; Language Model; Meta Model; Meta-model Matching; Model Migrations; Model Semantics; Model-driven Engineering; Semantic Similarity; Transformation Rules; Semantics","Computational linguistics; Iterative methods; Latent semantic analysis; Ontology; Software engineering; Terminology; Domains specific languages; F measure; Language model; Meta model; Meta-model matching; Model migrations; Model semantics; Model-driven Engineering; Semantic similarity; Transformation rules; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009099546"

This issue is particularly critical in highly specialized fields such as life sciences, where ontology accuracy directly impacts knowledge representation and decision-making. In this work, we introduce an automated evaluation framework that systematically assesses the quality of LLM-generated ontologies by comparing their concepts and relationship triples against domain knowledge (i.e. expert-curated domain ontologies). Our approach leverages transformer-based semantic similarity methods to detect hallucinations, ensuring that generated ontologies align with real-world knowledge. We evaluate our framework using six LLM-generated ontologies, validating them against three reference ontologies with increasing domain specificity.

While previous work has focused on using large language models (LLMs) for assessing ontology creation, fully automated ontology generation remains underexplored. As a consequence, most research relies on a limited set of well-known ontologies or knowledge graphs, which constrains the evaluation of various tasks such as link prediction and knowledge graph completion. This highlights the need for diverse ontology benchmarks with varying characteristics, such as number of concepts, hierarchy depth and so on, to effectively evaluate tasks such as link prediction and knowledge graph completion. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of generating ontologies using LLMs and evaluate whether they can produce ontologies of comparable quality to human-built ones. Given a seed set of concepts, a target number of concepts, relations, and maximum hierarchy depth, we employ three different LLMs to generate ontologies within the heart disease domain. Defining a seed set of concepts is particularly important for modeling the features of tabular datasets, enabling structured knowledge representation for downstream tasks. We systematically evaluate the generated ontologies by analyzing their structural integrity, semantic coherence, and suitability for downstream tasks. Our results show that while LLM-generated ontologies differ structurally from human-built ones, they remain comparable in semantic similarity and downstream ML performance, with LLaMA-generated ontologies proving to be the most effective. These findings highlight the potential of LLM-generated ontologies not only to support automated knowledge representation but also to enhance ontology benchmarks by introducing diverse structural characteristics, enabling more comprehensive evaluations of machine learning tasks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Domain-specific Ontologies; Large-language Models; Ontology Evaluation; Ontology Generation; Benchmarking; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; Learning Systems; Semantics; As-links; Domain-specific Ontologies; Down-stream; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge-representation; Language Model; Large-language Model; Ontology Evaluations; Ontology Generation; Ontology's; Ontology","Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge graph; Learning systems; Semantics; AS-links; Domain-specific ontologies; Down-stream; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge-representation; Language model; Large-language model; Ontology evaluations; Ontology generation; Ontology's; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008498807"

We propose a linguistic turn in designing AI agents, using typologically diverse alignment systems, particularly ergative-absolutive languages such as Basque, as tools to rethink how agency is modeled and enacted in language-trained systems. We argue that Large Language Models (LLMs), far from being mere predictive tools, function as performative stages where grammars of agency are enacted rather than encoded. This reframing invites a shift: from optimizing systems to express predefined meanings, to interpreting the emergent structures that unfold through interaction. Drawing on the metaphor of the dreaming machine, we treat unpredictability and improvisation not merely as limitations of reasoning, but as openings for enacting alternative ontologies of action. To explore this, we propose a two-step framework. First, we examine how alignment patterns surface in LLM-generated interaction, not as imposed rules, but as constraints enacted by the grammar in context. Second, we stage participatory simulations in which stakeholders co-design agents with contrasting grammatical alignments, testing how such reconfigurations may support more adaptive, negotiated, and accountable forms of agency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Agency; Ai-human Collaboration; Deliberative Ai; Ergative Ai; Ergative Languages; Language Alignment; Performative Simulations; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Grammars; Computer Simulation Languages; Ontology; Ai Agency; Ai-human Collaboration; Deliberative Ai; Ergative Ai; Ergative Language; Language Alignment; Language Model; Participatory Simulations; Performative Simulation; Rule Based; Alignment","Artificial intelligence; Computational grammars; Computer simulation languages; Ontology; AI agency; AI-human collaboration; Deliberative AI; Ergative AI; Ergative language; Language alignment; Language model; Participatory simulations; Performative simulation; Rule based; Alignment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008498574"

As the general body of scientific knowledge grows, so too does the burden of contextualizing a new experiment. While ontologies and databases serve as structured common repositories, their rigid schemas are often incompatible with the unstructured or semi-structured formats of most laboratories. In this study we investigate the integration of large language models (LLMs) with ontology-based vector databases to anchor semi-structured scientific experiments into knowledge bases via automated retrieval. Our approach extracts scientific entities from unstructured experimental texts, and grounds them to relevant ontology terms. We automate knowledge grounding, which enhances the integration of unstructured experimental data into established formal scientific languages. We have tested our method on a diverse selection of experimental yeast biology papers focused on Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a foundational model system that has driven major discoveries in molecular and cellular biology, and observed strong pipeline performance. We argue that such a knowledge grounding approach is a critical component for the new wave of efficient artificial intelligence (AI) driven automated laboratories that integrate LLMs with high-throughput experimentation and data-driven discovery. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Information Extraction For Rkgs/skgs; Knowledge Engineering; Large Language Models; Ontologies; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Automation; Data Integration; Electric Grounding; Information Retrieval; Knowledge Engineering; Molecular Biology; Throughput; Yeast; Cerevisiae; High-throughput; Information Extraction For Rkg/skg; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Saccharomyces; Scientific Discovery; Scientific Knowledge; Semi-structured; Ontology","Automation; Data integration; Electric grounding; Information retrieval; Knowledge engineering; Molecular biology; Throughput; Yeast; Cerevisiae; High-throughput; Information extraction for RKG/SKG; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Saccharomyces; Scientific discovery; Scientific knowledge; Semi-structured; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008492610"

This trend has enabled the creation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) trained on corpora containing trillions of words extracted from text on the internet. However, current language theory inadequately addresses digital text communication’s unique characteristics and constraints. This paper systematically analyzes and synthesizes existing literature to map the theoretical landscape of digitized language. The evidence demonstrates that, parallel to spoken language, features of written communication are frequently correlated with the socially constructed demographic identities of writers, a phenomenon we refer to as “digital accents.” This conceptualization raises complex ontological questions about the nature of digital text and its relationship to social identity. The same line of questioning, in conjunction with recent research, shows how generative AI systematically fails to capture the breadth of expression observed in human writing, an outcome we call “homogeneity-by-design.” By approaching text-based language from this theoretical framework while acknowledging its inherent limitations, social scientists studying language can strengthen their critical analysis of AI systems and contribute meaningful insights to their development and improvement. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Homogenization; Computational Text Analysis; Large Language Models; Sociolinguistics; Sociology","","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008384330"

The use of ontologies, such as the European Skills, Competences, Qualifications, and Occupations (ESCO), plays a crucial role in organizing and managing the skills required for modern engineering roles. However, the slow pace of ontology updates and the lack of contextual adaptability present significant challenges, leading to outdated and irrelevant information for educators, learners, and industry professionals. This paper explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge engineering to accelerate the process of updating ontologies like ESCO. By dynamically analyzing data and incor-porating contextual information, LLMs offer promising avenues for enhancing the evolution and precision of these ontologies. We discuss the potential impact of this approach in engineering education, particularly in aligning ups killing and reskilling efforts with the demands of emerging technologies such as AI -driven automation and digital engineering.

It can play an important role in data management, data exploration, ontology learning, and many data-centric applications. Existing schema inference systems focus more on XML, JSON or RDF data, and often rely on lexical formats and structures of the data for calculating similarities, with limited exploitation of the semantics of the text across a table. Motivated by recent works on taxonomy completion and construction using Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper presents two LLM-based methods for taxonomy inference for tables: (i) EmTT which embeds columns by fine-tuning with contrastive learning encoder-alone LLMs like BERT and utilises clustering for hierarchy construction, and (ii) GeTT which generates table entity types and their hierarchy by iterative prompting using a decoder-alone LLM like GPT-4. Extensive evaluation on three real-world datasets with six metrics covering different aspects of the output taxonomies has demonstrated that EmTT and GeTT can both produce taxonomies with strong consistency relative to the Ground Truth. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive Learning; Large Language Models; Prompt Learning; Schema Inference; Tabular Data; Taxonomy Inference; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Information Management; Learning Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Critical Tasks; Data Exploration; Entity-types; Language Model; Large Language Model; Management Data; Prompt Learning; Schema Inference; Tabular Data; Taxonomy Inference; Taxonomies","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Information management; Learning systems; Ontology; Semantics; Critical tasks; Data exploration; Entity-types; Language model; Large language model; Management data; Prompt learning; Schema inference; Tabular data; Taxonomy inference; Taxonomies","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008012410"

It focuses on identifying semantic relations between entities in text. Pretrained language models (PLMs), such as transformer-based models like BERT, XLNet and RoBERTa, have made notable progress in RE. Predictions of relations from these models are provided with varying confidence levels. While high-confidence predictions of relations are generally accurate, low-confidence predictions tend to be less precise and often lead to inaccuracies. The current research question is how to re-evaluate the low confidence predictions to ensure the overall confidence of a PLM. To solve this problem we propose a framework using automatically generated ontology schemas and LLMs. We first propose an algorithm that constructs ontology schemas from the RE datasets (TACRED and ReTACRED). Then we use LLMs to validate these low-confidence predictions through prompting to further improve the precision of final predictions. Experimental results on transformer-based models, GCN and LSTM-based models across two large-scale RE datasets (TACRED and ReTACRED) show significant improvements in precision and overall performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Construction; Large Language Models (llms); Ontology Schema; Relation Extraction; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Extraction; Knowledge Graph; Large Datasets; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Prediction Models; Semantics; Confidence Predictions; Graph Construction; Knowledge Graph Construction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model-based Validation; Ontology Schema; Ontology's; Relation Extraction; Forecasting","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Extraction; Knowledge graph; Large datasets; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Prediction models; Semantics; Confidence predictions; Graph construction; Knowledge graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Model-based validation; Ontology schema; Ontology's; Relation extraction; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007980362"

Objective: We aimed to extract reported sepsis biomarkers to provide users with comprehensive biomedical information and integrate retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and prompt engineering to enhance the accuracy, stability, and interpretability of clinical decisions recommended by large language models (LLMs). Methods: To address the challenge, we established and updated the first knowledge-enhanced platform, MetaSepsisKnowHub, comprising 427 sepsis biomarkers and 423 studies, aiming to systematically collect and annotate sepsis biomarkers to guide personalized clinical decision-making in the diagnosis and treatment of human sepsis. We curated a tailored LLM framework incorporating RAG and prompt engineering and incorporated 2 performance evaluation scales: the System Usability Scale and the Net Promoter Score. Results: The overall quantitative ratings of expert-reviewed clinical recommendations based on RAG surpassed baseline responses generated by 4 LLMs and showed a statistically significant improvement in textual questions (GPT-4: mean 75.79, SD 7.11 vs mean 81.59, SD 9.87; P=.02; GPT-4o: mean 70.36, SD 7.63 vs mean 77.98, SD 13.26; P=.02; Qwen2.5-instruct: mean 77.08 SD 3.75 vs mean 85.46, SD 7.27; P<.001; and DeepSeek-R1: mean 77.67, SD 3.66 vs mean 86.42, SD 8.56; P<.001), but no significant statistical differences could be measured in clinical scenarios. The RAG assessment score comparing RAG-based responses and expert-provided benchmark answers illustrated prominent factual correctness, accuracy, and knowledge recall compared to the baseline responses. After use, the average the System Usability Scale score was 82.20 (SD 14.17) and the Net Promoter Score was 72, demonstrating high user satisfaction and loyalty. Conclusions: We highlight the pioneering MetaSepsisKnowHub platform, and we show that combining MetaSepsisKnowHub with RAG can minimize limitations on precision and maximize the breadth of LLMs to shorten the bench-to-bedside distance, serving as a knowledge-enhanced paradigm for future application of artificial intelligence in critical care medicine. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Human Sepsis; Knowledge-enhanced; Personalized Application; Precision Medicine; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Adrenomedullin; C Reactive Protein; Lactic Acid; Procalcitonin; Biomarkers; Metasepsisknowhub; Adrenomedullin; Amino Terminal Pro Brain Natriuretic Peptide; Antiinfective Agent; C Reactive Protein; Calgranulin A; Cd14 Antigen; Interleukin 10; Interleukin 6; Lactic Acid; Long Untranslated Rna; New Drug; Procalcitonin; Biological Marker; Adult; Article; Artificial Intelligence-assisted Diagnosis; Bioinformatics; Clinical Article; Clinical Decision Making; Clinical Practice; Context Conflict Hallucination; Controlled Study; Correlation Coefficient; Data Interpretation; Data Mining; Data Quality; Diagnostic Accuracy; Disease Severity; Fact Conflict Hallucination; Few Shot Learning; Gene Interaction; Gene Ontology; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Human; Human Tissue; Information Processing; Information Retrieval; Input Conflict Hallucination; Kegg; Knowledge Enhanced Platform; Knowledge Management; Large Language Model; Medical Informatics; Medical Terminology; Medline; Net Promoter Score; Newborn; Personalized Medicine; Prompt Engineering; Protein Protein Interaction; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Scoring System; Semi Structured Interview; Sensitivity And Specificity; Sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; Statistically Significant Result; System Usability Scale Score; Systems Biology; Web Of Science; Young Adult; Diagnosis; Therapy; Biomarkers; Humans; Precision Medicine; Sepsis","adrenomedullin; amino terminal pro brain natriuretic peptide; antiinfective agent; C reactive protein; calgranulin A; CD14 antigen; interleukin 10; interleukin 6; lactic acid; long untranslated RNA; new drug; procalcitonin; biological marker; adult; Article; artificial intelligence-assisted diagnosis; bioinformatics; clinical article; clinical decision making; clinical practice; context conflict hallucination; controlled study; correlation coefficient; data interpretation; data mining; data quality; diagnostic accuracy; disease severity; fact conflict hallucination; few shot learning; gene interaction; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; generative artificial intelligence; human; human tissue; information processing; information retrieval; input conflict hallucination; KEGG; knowledge enhanced platform; knowledge management; large language model; medical informatics; medical terminology; Medline; Net Promoter Score; newborn; personalized medicine; prompt engineering; protein protein interaction; retrieval augmented generation; scoring system; semi structured interview; sensitivity and specificity; sepsis; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; statistically significant result; System Usability Scale score; systems biology; Web of Science; young adult; diagnosis; therapy; Biomarkers; Humans; Precision Medicine; Sepsis","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007975026"

Sharing a common structural representation by mapping concepts and relationships between the schemas is essential to ensure data interoperability (especially on a semantic level), integration, reuse, and the ability to leverage machine-processable and advanced-search capabilities. Archival institutions preserve, manage, and provide access to large amounts of diverse cultural and historical data, demonstrating a high potential to be active contributors to a global knowledge network, should archival data be transformed and offered as linked (open) data. The present study aims to improve the alignment of the Swedish National Archives schema to a core ontology for archival resources description (Records-in-Context Ontology - RiC-O) by producing conceptual mappings between them and reusing as many elements and relations as possible from Records-in-Context.

Addressing these questions requires to integrate multiple heterogeneous data sets which is time consuming and error prone and demands domain as well as knowledge experts. Knowledge graphs (KGs) are practical for consolidating inventory data by bringing it into the same format and linking inventory items. However, the KG creation and maintenance itself pose challenges as mappings are needed to connect data sets and ontologies. In this work, we address these challenges by exploring LLM-supported and context-enhanced YARRRML mapping generation. Facing large ontologies in the manufacturing domain and token limitations in LLM prompts, we further evaluate ontology reduction methods in our approach. Our work provides a valuable support when creating YARRRML manufacturing mappings as well as supporting data and schema updates.

However, clinicians, especially junior physicians, often face challenges due to the complexity of describing patient phenotypes accurately. Traditional manual search methods using HPO databases are time-consuming and prone to errors. Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate whether the use of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can improve the accuracy of junior physicians in identifying HPO terms from patient images related to rare diseases. Methods: In total, 20 junior physicians from 10 specialties participated. Each physician evaluated 27 patient images sourced from publicly available literature, with phenotypes relevant to rare diseases listed in the Chinese Rare Disease Catalogue. The study was divided into 2 groups: the manual search group relied on the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology website, while the MLLM-assisted group used an electronic questionnaire that included HPO terms preidentified by ChatGPT-4o as prompts, followed by a search using the Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology. The primary outcome was the accuracy of HPO identification, defined as the proportion of correctly identified HPO terms compared to a standard set determined by an expert panel. Additionally, the accuracy of outputs from ChatGPT-4o and 2 open-source MLLMs (Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b) was evaluated using the same criteria, with hallucinations for each model documented separately. Furthermore, participating physicians completed an additional electronic questionnaire regarding their rare disease background to identify factors affecting their ability to accurately describe patient images using standardized HPO terms. Results: A total of 270 descriptions were evaluated per group. The MLLM-assisted group achieved a significantly higher accuracy rate of 67.4% (182/270) compared to 20.4% (55/270) in the manual group (relative risk 3.31, 95% CI 2.58‐4.25; P<.001). The MLLM-assisted group demonstrated consistent performance across departments, whereas the manual group exhibited greater variability. Among standalone MLLMs, ChatGPT-4o achieved an accuracy of 48% (13/27), while the open-source models Llama3.2:11b and Llama3.2:90b achieved 15% (4/27) and 18% (5/27), respectively. However, MLLMs exhibited a high hallucination rate, frequently generating HPO terms with incorrect IDs or entirely fabricated content. Specifically, ChatGPT-4o, Llama3.2:11b, and Llama3.2:90b generated incorrect IDs in 57.3% (67/117), 98% (62/63), and 82% (46/56) of cases, respectively, and fabricated terms in 34.2% (40/117), 41% (26/63), and 32% (18/56) of cases, respectively. Additionally, a survey on the rare disease knowledge of junior physicians suggests that participation in rare disease and genetic disease training may enhance the performance of some physicians. Conclusions: The integration of MLLMs into clinical workflows significantly enhances the accuracy of HPO identification by junior physicians, offering promising potential to improve the diagnosis of rare diseases and standardize phenotype descriptions in medical research. However, the notable hallucination rate observed in MLLMs underscores the necessity for further refinement and rigorous validation before widespread adoption in clinical practice. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chatgpt; Human Phenotype Ontology; Large Language Model; Multimodal Large Language Models; Open-source Llms; Rare Diseases; Achondroplasia; Acromegaly; Adult Onset Still Disease; Alagille Syndrome; Albinism; Albright Syndrome; Alport Syndrome; Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis; Angioneurotic Edema; Article; Bardet Biedl Syndrome; Biological Ontology; Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus; Chatgpt; Chinese; Clinical Article; Clinical Practice; Congenital Malformation; Controlled Study; Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma; Fabry Disease; Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva; Gaucher Disease; Generalized Pustular Psoriasis; Genetic Disorder; Hallucination; Happy Puppet Syndrome; Human; Jeune Syndrome; Large Language Model; Lennox Gastaut Syndrome; Marfan Syndrome; Myasthenia Gravis; Noonan Syndrome; Peutz Jeghers Syndrome; Phenotype; Physician; Poems Syndrome; Progeria; Randomized Controlled Trial; Rare Disease; Risk Factor; Scoliosis; Suppurative Hidradenitis; Comparative Study; Language; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Phenotype","achondroplasia; acromegaly; adult onset Still disease; Alagille syndrome; albinism; Albright syndrome; Alport syndrome; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; angioneurotic edema; Article; Bardet Biedl syndrome; biological ontology; blue rubber bleb nevus; ChatGPT; Chinese; clinical article; clinical practice; congenital malformation; controlled study; cutaneous T cell lymphoma; Fabry disease; fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva; Gaucher disease; generalized pustular psoriasis; genetic disorder; hallucination; happy puppet syndrome; human; jeune syndrome; large language model; Lennox Gastaut syndrome; Marfan syndrome; myasthenia gravis; Noonan syndrome; Peutz Jeghers syndrome; phenotype; physician; POEMS syndrome; progeria; randomized controlled trial; rare disease; risk factor; scoliosis; suppurative hidradenitis; comparative study; language; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Large Language Models; Phenotype","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007323200"

This paper starts with an introduction to the persistent power struggle between human and technology and shines a light on Professor Michael Cooley’s involvement with the Lucas Plan in the 1970s and his PhD work which focused on the transition from manual draftsmanship to Computer Aided Design in engineering. A research lab is identified as a ‘complex adaptive system’ and forms the basis of a longitudinal case study on the Human Centered bottom-up approach to digitisation of cultural heritage. Components required to support and nurture the growth of a Participation Action Research lab are identified. The novel ‘ENRICHER’ method embodies human centeredness and is operationalized, tested, evaluated and findings discussed. Examples of emergence are also discussed. A metric of the ENRICHER method initially identified where the lab did not fully meet all the methods 8 points. Subsequent actions adjusted the holonic lens focus to metadata and the ongoing work on the creation of a cataloging tool for the librarians. The use of XML technologies integrates the work into a larger model of intelligence. It positions the work on the semantic web technology stack and opens up the pathway to ontology generation and development and management of large language models. The ENRICHER method is a way of developing human–machine symbiotics that also incorporate AI e.g. transcription, metadata generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Human Centered; Tacit Knowledge; Xml; Complex Adaptive Systems; Computer-aided Design; Human Centered; Human Centered Systems; Longitudinal Case Study; Ontology's; Power; Research Labs; Social Dynamics; Tacit Knowledge; Computer Aided Logic Design","Complex adaptive systems; Computer-aided design; Human centered; Human centered systems; Longitudinal case study; Ontology's; Power; Research labs; Social dynamics; Tacit knowledge; Computer aided logic design","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007238787"

Moreover, with the rise of large language models (LLMs), approaches that automate related data access have become tempting. However, real-world databases are often inherently complex and heterogeneously structured, complicating using LLM-based text-to-SQL. Previous studies report an accuracy of only 16%, which indicates the need for better approaches. This paper investigates how ontologies can support LLMs in increasing the accuracy of querying real-world databases. Based on the need to reduce overcrowding, we propose an ontology for modeling complex, multi-level occupancy data. Our ontology, based on previous work, is theoretically well-founded and compatible with existing tourism ontologies. In a case study based on a real-world database from Outdooractive, one of the largest European outdoor tourism platforms, we compare vanilla LLM-based text-to-SQL's performance with ontology-based data access. Our results show that the ontology-based approach almost triples the querying accuracy, which illustrates the effectiveness and potential of such semantic approaches. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Occupancy Prediction; Ontologies; Smart Tourism; Visitor Management","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007233613"

The current approach for model updation involves time-consuming and costly retraining procedures due to the incrementally growing dataset size. Thus, continual learning approaches that incrementally accommodate changes in data distributions without exhaustive retraining hold promise for efficient model updation in the fashion domain. In this paper, we study incremental learning for fashion attribute extraction (FAE), an essential task with many downstream applications. Previous studies on FAE have been on purely static settings, and no fashion-domain datasets exist to study the incremental FAE task. In order to address this, we propose an algorithm to transform a static dataset into an evolving dataset and apply the proposed method to existing static FAE datasets. We observe that both generative and discriminative Visual Language Models (VLMs) have dominated static FAE benchmarks. Hence, we choose to extend continual learning frameworks proposed for VLMs to create three discriminative and two generative baselines for the incremental FAE task. We show that, under an evolving ontology, the generative baselines exhibit 50% lower catastrophic forgetting (CF) compared to the discriminative setting for the incremental DeepFashion dataset with a complex ontology. In comparison, we see equivalent performance on the incremental FashionAI dataset with a relatively simple ontology. Finally, we compare our generative VLM baselines with zero and few-shot Gemini baselines on the incremental FAE task, demonstrating that the marginal performance gain does not justify its significantly higher computational cost and inference time (approximately 140x more compute and 150x slower inference), encouraging further research into efficient specialist models for incremental FAE. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Catastrophic Forgetting; Continual Learning; Fashion Attribute Extraction; Generative Vlms; 'current; Attributes Extractions; Catastrophic Forgetting; Continual Learning; Data Set Size; Fashion Attribute Extraction; Generative Visual Language Model; Learning Approach; Ontology's; Visual Language Model","'current; Attributes extractions; Catastrophic forgetting; Continual learning; Data set size; Fashion attribute extraction; Generative visual language model; Learning approach; Ontology's; Visual language model","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006879779"

The current interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) provides an opportunity to examine how this discourse differs across fields of study. I examine the descriptions of language in online educational materials and in a course designed to teach Python and its use in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Instructors and textbooks explicitly introduce language as a semantic, referential, and denotationally transparent system of logical units encoded in text. In practice, instructors use a wide variety of nonreferential indexical communicative strategies such as hedging, voicing, and gesture, as well as semantically ambiguous linguistic techniques like anthropomorphism, metonym, and metaphor, that are not included in the educators’ definition of language. Instead of treating this discourse as evidence of a particular language ideology, I argue it makes sense to speak of domain-specific language ontologies. Using an ontological frame explains why concepts of language across neighbouring disciplines such as computational linguistics, sociolinguistics, and linguistic anthropology often feel incommensurable. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Code; Language Ontology; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Python; Context Free Grammars; Context Sensitive Grammars; Ontology; Python; Semantics; Teaching; 'current; Computer Codes; Educational Materials; Language Model; Language Ontology; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Ontology's; Natural Language Processing Systems","Context free grammars; Context sensitive grammars; Ontology; Python; Semantics; Teaching; 'current; Computer codes; Educational materials; Language model; Language ontology; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology's; Natural language processing systems","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006805154"

A crucial step in this process is mapping data elements to ontological concepts, which typically involves substantial manual effort. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in automating complex language-related tasks and may offer a solution to streamline biological data annotation. This study investigates the utility of LLMs—specifically various base and fine-tuned GPT models—for the automatic assignment of ontological identifiers to biological sample labels. We evaluated model performance in annotating labels to four widely used ontologies: the Cell Line Ontology (CLO), Cell Ontology (CL), Uber-anatomy Ontology (UBERON), and BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO). Our dataset was compiled from publicly available, high-quality databases containing biologically relevant sequence information, which suffers from inconsistent annotation practices, complicating integrative analyses. Model outputs were compared against annotations generated by text2term, a state-of-the-art annotation tool. The fine-tuned GPT model outperformed both the base models and text2term in annotating cell lines and cell types, particularly for the CL and UBERON ontologies, achieving a precision of 47–64% and a recall of 88–97%. In contrast, base models exhibited significantly lower performance. These results suggest that fine-tuned LLMs can accelerate and improve the accuracy of biological data annotation. Nonetheless, our evaluation highlights persistent challenges, including variable precision across ontology categories and the continued need for expert curation to ensure annotation validity. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinformatics; Biological Samples; Data Interoperability; Generative Ai; Large Language Models; Formal Concept Analysis; Ontology; Base Models; Biological Data; Biological Samples; Cell Lines; Data Annotation; Data Interoperability; Generative Ai; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Tissue Culture; Biological Product; Anatomical Concepts; Anatomy Ontology; Article; Data Base; Data Interoperability; False Negative Result; False Positive Result; Female; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Hela Cell Line; Human; Human Cell; Large Language Model; Medical Ontology; Medical Research; Ontology; Ontology Development; Uterine Epithelium","Formal concept analysis; Ontology; Base models; Biological data; Biological samples; Cell lines; Data annotation; Data interoperability; Generative AI; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Tissue culture; biological product; anatomical concepts; anatomy ontology; Article; data base; data interoperability; false negative result; false positive result; female; generative artificial intelligence; HeLa cell line; human; human cell; large language model; medical ontology; medical research; ontology; ontology development; uterine epithelium","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006647768"

However, most knowledge is recorded in unstructured formats using natural language, which induces additional efforts to retrieve information. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has been developed to support general IR in unstructured text, yet it often produces inconsistencies due to model limitations. To address these inconsistencies, we propose transforming unstructured texts into structured information using text-to-Knowledge Graph (KG) translation. KGs support robust retrieval and reasoning tools, making them well-suited for complex knowledge representation. They are also understandable for humans. Our approach employs open-ended information extraction (for node extraction) and open-ended relation extraction (for relation extraction). To ensure the fidelity of the information present in the input text, we want to leverage a new combination of syntactic analysis for entity and relation extraction and Large Language Model (LLM) analysis to link the entities together. Initial implementations of this pipeline showed that our method effectively produces understandable and queryable KG. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Population; Large Language Models; Open Information Extraction; Relation Extraction; Syntactic Analysis; Computational Grammars; Content Based Retrieval; Machine Translation; Query Processing; Structured Query Language; Syntactics; Knowledge Graph Population; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Open Information Extraction; Question Answering; Relation Extraction; Structured Data; Syntactic Analysis; Unstructured Texts; Online Searching","Computational grammars; Content based retrieval; Machine translation; Query processing; Structured Query Language; Syntactics; Knowledge graph population; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Open information extraction; Question Answering; Relation extraction; Structured data; Syntactic analysis; Unstructured texts; Online searching","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006620090"

This approach transforms domain knowledge, such as glossaries and ontologies, into synthetic textual definitions or question-answer pairs, useful for fine-tuning an LLM to internalize specialized concepts, definitions, and semantic relationships. We demonstrate the impact of this approach with a case study in the nuclear safety domain, leveraging the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Safety Glossary to fine-tune an LLM.

Modeling and simulation play an important role in this process by providing meaningful representations and analyses of attacks and defense strategies, particularly in systems where security breaches could have devastating consequences. The ADversary VIew Security Evaluation (ADVISE) Meta framework offers an ontology-based approach that, starting from a system’s architectural model, automatically generates detailed security models representing the attack steps that adversaries might take to achieve their goals. Manually extending the ADVISE Meta ontology with specific attack patterns is a challenging task that involves a deep understanding of the ontology, and its semantics. It also requires analyzing the attack paths to identify the necessary information in the ontology. To address this challenge we propose a methodology to facilitate the integration of attack patterns into the ADVISE Meta framework using ChatGPT. We focus on the Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) catalog by MITRE, a popular catalog with more than 500 attack patterns describing the common attributes and approaches used by adversaries to exploit known weaknesses in IT systems.

This research introduces an IoT meta-search engine prototype designed to aggregate and merge metadata from commercial IoT search engines (Shodan, Censys, Netlas, Zoomeye, Binaryedge, Fofa) complemented by Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) and Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) sources.

However, due to the rising trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, frameworks like Model Cards, Service Cards and Data Cards have emerged to facilitate understanding and reusing those models and datasets. Moreover, the Dataspace concept integrates these resources into Dataspace Cards, a comprehensive framework that systematically captures and organises crucial information to guide model and data selection for a specific application. This paper advocates a Semantic Web approach for transforming Model/Data Cards into Linked Data or knowledge graphs within a Dataspace, rendering them machine-readable and interoperable. A significant contribution is the development of a vocabulary that unifies Data, Model and Dataspace Card ontologies, enhancing consistent documentation and understanding of the Dataspace design. The paper further demonstrates the applicability of the proposed schema in various use cases, including bias detection in BERT-base-uncased and Large Language Models. Additionally, we propose a conceptual semantic approach, examined in-depth for sentiment and emotion analysis, to highlight how extended Dataspace Cards can improve applicability and outcomes. We found that this unified, ontology-driven approach results in more consistent metadata linking and more fine-grained bias detection in BERT-based-uncased than standalone documentation tools relying solely on Model or Data Cards. Furthermore, compared to existing frameworks, the richer interlinking capabilities of our proposed Dataspace Cards also facilitated easier traceability of performance outcomes, thereby ultimately fostering higher trustworthiness and reusability of AI resources. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Documentation; Data Cards; Dataspace Cards; Model Cards; Semantic Web; Service Cards; Ai Documentation; Data Cards; Data Space; Dataspace Card; Model Card; Modeling Data; Ontology's; Semantic Approach; Semantic-web; Service Card","AI documentation; Data cards; Data space; Dataspace card; Model card; Modeling data; Ontology's; Semantic approach; Semantic-Web; Service card","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005595465"

We propose leveraging BioSTransformers, our developed and trained siamese neural network models on biomedical data, to discover new relevant relationships between different biomedical concepts and create novel semantic relationships between these concepts. Our objective is to build a consistent, merged ontology that serves as a valuable resource for healthcare professionals across various health-related applications. To assess and validate the newly generated relationships, we plan to use external knowledge bases such as the UMLS Metathesaurus and the Semantic Network, alongside a large language model. Initial results are encouraging and pave the way for further research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Ontologies; Large Language Models; Ontology Merging; Siamese Neural Models; Adverse Events; Biomedical Domain; Biomedical Ontologies; Disease Symptoms; Language Model; Large Language Model; Neural Modelling; Ontology Merging; Ontology's; Siamese Neural Model; Diseases","Adverse events; Biomedical domain; Biomedical ontologies; Disease symptoms; Language model; Large language model; Neural modelling; Ontology merging; Ontology's; Siamese neural model; Diseases","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005256728"

Calls for effective ethical responses to the pressurised AI environment have in turn abounded. Posthumanism, which seeks to build ethical futures by de-centring the ‘human’, is an obvious candidate to act as a lynchpin of theoretical intervention. In their responses, posthumanist scholars appear to have embraced AI’s potential to destabilise Humanist philosophical ideas. We critically interrogate this initial enthusiasm. Conceptually distinguishing ‘post-dualist self-development’ (PDSD) from ‘technical self-development’ (TSD), we show how AI prompts an urgent need to advance posthumanist engagement with how technical development unsupervised by humans is ontologically discrete from other forms of material agency. We argue that specific engagement with TSD as distinct from PDSD is a key to avoid ignoring or underestimating Humanist and anthropocentric aspects of current AI innovation, and the influence of anthropomorphism. Without a theoretical reckoning with these tensions, posthumanism in the AI-era runs the risk of potentially promoting technologies that reinvigorate Humanist and anthropocentric expansion. To conclude, we show how a posthumanist ethics of generative AI that pays requisite attention to both TSD and PDSD may enable more anticipatory and nuanced assessments of the risks and benefits of discrete AI technologies to inform public discourse, appropriate social, institutional, policy and governance responses, and direct AI research and development priorities. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Humanism; Large Language Models; Posthumanism; Self-development; 'current; Ai Technologies; Humanism; Institutional Policies; Language Model; Large Language Model; Posthumanism; Research And Development; Self-development; Technical Development; Ethical Technology","'current; AI Technologies; Humanism; Institutional policies; Language model; Large language model; Posthumanism; Research and development; Self-development; Technical development; Ethical technology","Article","aip","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005165796"

RDF knowledge graphs offer a powerful solution, yet their creation and maintenance, especially for complex medical ontologies like Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), remain challenging. Traditional methods often struggle with the scale, heterogeneity, and semantic complexity of medical data. This paper introduces a methodology leveraging the contextual understanding and reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance medical ontology mapping for Resource Description Framework (RDF) knowledge graph construction. We conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of six systems–GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2, Gemini 1.5 Pro, Llama 3.3 70B, DeepSeek R1, and BERTMap—using a novel evaluation framework that combines quantitative metrics (precision, recall, and F1-score) with qualitative assessments of semantic accuracy. Our approach integrates a data preprocessing pipeline with an LLM-powered semantic mapping engine, utilizing BioBERT embeddings and ChromaDB vector database for efficient concept retrieval. Experimental results on a dataset of 108 medical terms demonstrate the superior performance of modern LLMs, particularly GPT-4o, achieving a precision of 93.75% and an F1-score of 96.26%.

Developing effective emergency response decisions for such complex and dynamic incidents requires comprehensively considering various knowledge domains. Relying solely on expert experience and emergency plans often fails to meet the demands of effective emergency response. To enhance the efficiency of emergency response decision-making in chemical process accidents, this study proposes a method that leverages a chemical process safety knowledge graph (CPSKG) to enhance large language models (LLMs) for generating reliable emergency response decisions. The proposed method uses a seven-step approach to designing scenario and emergency response ontologies. By aligning with the characteristics of emergency domain knowledge texts and the ontology framework, natural language processing (NLP) and retrieval-augmented generation using graphs (Graph RAG) techniques are employed to construct a semantically rich CPSKG. The entities and relationships within the graph enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, facilitating the generation of efficient and reliable emergency response decisions. A case study was conducted to validate the reliability of this approach. The results demonstrate that the LLM enhanced with the CPSKG outperforms other models in generating more effective emergency response decisions.

Yet, the status of this research field is rather preliminary and there is, for now, no systematic and comprehensive understanding on how LLMs perform on selected knowledge engineering tasks (e.g., what is their expertise level in understanding ontology modeling concepts). Such insights would be crucial for researchers working in this field to support with selecting the most suitable LLMs during experiment design. This situation is exacerbated by the rapid expansion in the number of available LLMs. We therefore see the need for methodologies and tools that allow (comparatively) assessing LLM capabilities. To address this need, we propose the creation of an assessment test benchmark for evaluating the LLM knowledge engineering skills. We present ongoing work and preliminary results on assessing the expertise of LLMs in terms of a concrete KE task, namely ontology validation. Our experiments highlight the superiority of proprietary models on this task, particularly GPT-4o and Claude-Sonnet-3.5, over open source models. Lastly, we identify the need of a community-driven comparative LLM assessment platform that facilitates resource sharing and experience exchange, while protecting the integrity and privacy of the envisioned benchmark.

However, directly applying LLMs, even with large token-sized prompts, does not achieve the task planning performance required for an industrial-grade domain-specific use-case (DSU). This work aims to overcome the obstacles of a robotic task planner for DSUs by introducing a novel planning framework, LLM-RSPF (Large Language Model-based Robotic System Planning Framework). Central to the LLM-RSPF is a novel robotic system ontology that organizes the components of the robotic system in a coherent and a systematic manner. The ontology empowers the LLM-RSP F to efficiently capture a contextual representation of the DSU using the LLMs. Subsequently, the research introduces a LLM-tuning regimen referred as chain of hierarchical thought (CoHT), specifically crafted to complement the proposed system ontology. Integrating these two components, the LLM-RSPF aims to enhance the accuracy, robustness, and throughput of a robotic system in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the research presents an empirical methodology to generate the LLM-tuning dataset size for a guaranteed performance. The LLM-RSPF is validated on a retail order-fulfillment use-case thereby, illustrating the efficacy of the framework.

However, poorly designed ontologies can lead to errors and performance issues. While systems engineering has standardized evaluation guidelines (e.g., ISO/IEC), ontology engineering lacks such standards, leading to various independent evaluation methods. One frequent issue among novice developers is the misuse of ontology restrictions, particularly ‘allValuesFrom’ and ‘someValuesFrom’, which can significantly impact the correctness and reliability of ontologies. However, existing studies have not adequately addressed effective methods for detecting such errors. To address this gap, we propose a context-aware verification framework utilizing large language models to detect and correct misuse in ontology restrictions. Unlike conventional methods, our framework integrates contextual descriptions derived from ontological axioms, enabling more accurate verification. Additionally, we introduce a clustering-based description generation method that systematically organizes contextual information, further enhancing verification accuracy. Experimental evaluation conducted on diverse ontology datasets suggests that contextual integration improves verification performance. Moreover, the clustering-based description generation improves restriction misuse detection and correction compared to traditional approaches. By automating ontology restriction verification, this study contributes significantly to enhancing the reliability of ontology evaluation and provides a foundation for developing more scalable and standardized verification techniques. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Ontology Evaluation; Ontology Restriction Verification; Text Generation; Iso Standards; Ontology; Clusterings; Data Interoperability; Data Systems; Ontology Evaluations; Ontology Restriction Verification; Ontology's; Performance Issues; Relationship Between Concepts; System Integration; Text Generations; Interoperability","ISO Standards; Ontology; Clusterings; Data interoperability; Data systems; Ontology evaluations; Ontology restriction verification; Ontology's; Performance issues; Relationship between concepts; System integration; Text generations; Interoperability","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003435799"

Educational KGs are of major importance in course design and personal learning. They collected and integrated data from multiple sources, such as textbooks and education guidelines, to provide systematic knowledge architecture for learners, gradually improving education quality. Previous work focused on massive manual operations and professional knowledge to build KGs and presented many limitations, such as increased time consumption. To address the above issues, this study proposes a pipeline that combines large language models (LLMs) and a graph embedding method to support KG construction for medical informatics, LLM-MIKG. Specifically, the entire construction process can be divided into three critical phases. First, we adopt a top-down approach to create an ontology, dividing medical informatics into clinical informatics, bioinformatics, pharmaceutical informatics, medical intelligence, medical information security, and intelligent medicine. Second, the prompting engineering should be optimized. This study designs a recursive prompting strategy to extract the entities and relationships of each knowledge node from top to bottom, forming many local KGs. Then, a graph embedding method is used to fuse local KGs to merge duplicate entities, establishing a complete medical informatics KG. Finally, the experimental results demonstrated the superiority of the proposed pipeline.

The results indicate 1) building information modeling, ontology, and natural language processing are identified as critical technologies in KM, 2) expert system and decision support, structural health monitoring, and project management are the major application domains. This article conducts an in-depth analysis of the literature based on the three phases of quality control: pre-construction, in-construction, and post-construction. The results are discussed to critically assess the critical technologies in KM. A framework is proposed to guide the effective implementation of KM in CQM, alongside a discussion of the current challenges and opportunities. The article further identifies potential development directions for KM in CQM, including total quality management, digital twins, development of large language models, construction of “No-cost” KM platforms, uniform evaluation and standardization mechanisms, tacit knowledge capture, and confidentiality and security.

First, LLMs are utilized to analyze user intentions, acquiring the hierarchical object structure of DT models. Second, by combining an analysis–retrieval method to extract domain knowledge and generate dynamic prompts, LLMs are guided to realize the creation and fusion of objects and construct structured and semantically enriched DT models.

However, security measures, often implemented late in the engineering process, lead to costly and complicated implementations. Thus, this article is concerned with the “security by design” principle in ICSs and facilitates compliance with ICS security standards, which can be legally mandated for some critical systems or adopted by asset owners to protect their assets. Current methods for compliance demand manual efforts from security experts, making the compliance process time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose a framework for leveraging large language models (LLMs) combined with knowledge graphs to automate the interpretation of security requirements and system architecture as two main elements of the design phase. Our knowledge graph-augmented LLM framework converts system architectures into human natural language, enhancing the automation of various security analyses, especially those that need to handle textual requirements. The framework enables validating applicable security requirements provided by IEC 62443-3-3 (a widely-used ICS security standard) concerning system designs through a question-and-answer interface. To evaluate the framework, various questions with reference responses from human experts were prepared in the context of a use case, and the quality of the LLMs' responses was measured across various metrics. Moreover, we compared the framework with a baseline approach based on formal queries. The results show that the proposed framework effectively automates security tasks and offers a user-friendly interface accessible to nonexperts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Industrial Control System (ics); Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model (llm); Ontology; Security By Design; Chemical Plants; Competition; Concrete Construction; Petroleum Products; Requirements Engineering; Control System Security; Industrial Control System; Industrial Control Systems; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Security By Design; Security Requirements; Security Standards; Knowledge Graph","Chemical plants; Competition; Concrete construction; Petroleum products; Requirements engineering; Control system security; Industrial control system; Industrial control systems; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Security by design; Security requirements; Security standards; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003034847"

However, challenges such as portability and interoperability among cloud platforms hinder seamless service integration. This thesis addresses these issues by proposing a conceptual framework for the semantic representation and enrichment of a Cloud Ontology, supported by Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies. The work focuses on leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to automate the population and management of ontologies. Advanced tools such as Protégé, Dify, and RAGFlow were utilized to develop innovative solutions for representing, querying, and interactively visualizing knowledge in cloud domains. Semantic technologies like RDF and OWL ensured broad interoperability, while the integration of linguistic models enabled continuous and dynamic updates of information. The results demonstrate significant improvements in the automation of ontology management processes and access to structured data. This thesis contributes to the field of Knowledge Engineering by proposing an integrated approach to tackling the complexity and fragmentation of the cloud landscape.

While traditional genomewide association studies (GWAS) and sequencing technologies have advanced our understanding of epilepsy-related gene targets, they often struggle to identify novel and rare variants crucial for precise diagnosis and targeted drug development. The increasing availability of large-scale genomic data, coupled with the power of deep learning, offers a promising avenue for progress. Method: In this work, we introduce GraphTransNet, a novel hybrid neural network model designed for predicting epilepsy-associated gene targets, with direct implications for improved disease diagnosis and therapeutic target identification. GraphTransNet leverages protein language models (specifically ESM) to generate numerical embeddings from gene sequences. These embeddings are then processed by a novel architecture integrating transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN)components to predict epilepsy-related gene targets. Results: Our results demonstrate that GraphTransNet achieves high accuracy in identifying epilepsy targets, outperforming existing predictive tools in terms of both recall and precision metrics for reliable disease diagnosis and effective drug target identification. Rigorous comparisons with established machine learning methods and other deep learning architectures further underscore the efficacy of GraphTransNet. Discussion: This approach represents a valuable computational tool for advancing epilepsy genetics research, with the potential to contribute to more accurate diagnostic strategies and the discovery of novel drug targets for improved treatment outcomes. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Epilepsy Diseases; Epilepsy-associated Interactions; Protein Language Model; Transformer; Ablation Therapy; Area Under The Curve; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Artificial Neural Network; Bioinformatics; Controlled Study; Convolutional Neural Network; Cross Validation; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Epilepsy; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Gene Sequence; Genome-wide Association Study; Human; K Nearest Neighbor; Learning Algorithm; Measurement Precision; Natural Language Processing; Prediction; Protein Language Model; Protein Protein Interaction; Random Forest; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Single Nucleotide Polymorphism; Support Vector Machine; Synaptic Transmission; Whole Exome Sequencing","ablation therapy; area under the curve; Article; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; bioinformatics; controlled study; convolutional neural network; cross validation; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; epilepsy; gene expression; gene ontology; gene sequence; genome-wide association study; human; k nearest neighbor; learning algorithm; measurement precision; natural language processing; prediction; protein language model; protein protein interaction; random forest; receiver operating characteristic; single nucleotide polymorphism; support vector machine; synaptic transmission; whole exome sequencing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002619239"

The generic encoding of privacy threat knowledge is useful for increasing overall awareness of the diversity and scope of privacy threats and promoting broader application of privacy threat analysis. However, it also inhibits reuse of threat knowledge that is more tailored to the organization context or application domain. There is thus an emerging need to encode, manage, and share specialized privacy threat knowledge that may be more domain-, technology-, or organization-specific.

Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user’s preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Model; Neo4j; Ontology And Knowledge Graph Generator; Prompt Engineering; Ontology; Query Languages; Relational Database Systems; Structured Query Language; Graph Generation; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Neo4j; Ontology And Knowledge Graph Generator; Ontology Extraction; Ontology Graphs; Ontology's; Prompt Engineering; Knowledge Graph","Ontology; Query languages; Relational database systems; Structured Query Language; Graph generation; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Neo4j; Ontology and knowledge graph generator; Ontology Extraction; Ontology graphs; Ontology's; Prompt engineering; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002271575"

However, issues inherent to LLMs, such as output hallucinations, knowledge lags, and response biases, limit the quality of counseling services. To address these challenges, we propose a psychological counseling method that integrates a knowledge graph (KG) and multi-agent collaboration (MAC). First, we design an ontology model and use an improved convolution residual network (CRN) to extract relational triples for constructing a psychological medicine KG. Second, we perform low-rank adaptation (LoRA) on Qwen1.5-7B-chat using the Text2Cypher training set. Finally, we design MAC prompts based on the characteristics of the retrieval-based question-answering (QA) process to facilitate the collaborative implementation of psychological medicine knowledge QA and updates. The experiments showed that the improved CRN achieved an extraction accuracy of 80%. The mean squared error of the general-domain capability of the LLM before and after LoRA was only 0.738, with a Text2Cypher score of 99.8 after LoRA. The results generated after prompting received a 70.44% approval rate compared to other methods. Thus, the proposed method can effectively enhance the intelligence, accuracy, and controllability of psychological counseling. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A; Convolution Residual Network (crn); Knowledge Graph (kg); Low-rank Adaptation (lora); Multiagent; Psychological Counseling; R749; Tp18; Chatbots; Medicinal Chemistry; Multi Agent Systems; Ontology; A; Agent Collaboration; Convolution Residual Network; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Graphs; Low-rank Adaptation; Multi Agent; Psychological Counseling; R749; Tp18","Chatbots; Medicinal chemistry; Multi agent systems; Ontology; A; Agent collaboration; Convolution residual network; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Low-rank adaptation; Multi agent; Psychological counseling; R749; Tp18","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002241637"

This process is essential, as manually building ontologies is time-consuming and labour-intensive. The Qur’an, a vast source of knowledge for Muslims, presents linguistic and cultural complexities, with many words carrying multiple meanings depending on context. Ontologies offer a structured way to represent this knowledge, linking concepts systematically. Although various ontologies have been developed from the Qur’an for purposes such as advanced querying and analysis, most rely on manual creation methods. Few studies have examined the use of Ontology Learning for Qur’anic ontologies. Thus, this study evaluates three Ontology Learning techniques: Named Entity Recognition (NER), statistical methods, and Quranic patterns. The NER aims to find names represented by entity, statistical techniques aimed at finding frequently occurring words, and pattern-based techniques aim to identify complex relationships and multi-word expressions. The Ontology Learning techniques were evaluated based on precision, recall, and F-measure to assess extraction accuracy. The NER technique achieved an average precision of 0.62, statistical methods of 0.45, and pattern-based techniques of 0.58, indicating the strengths and weaknesses of each approach for extracting relevant terms as concepts, instances, or relations. This indicates that improvements or enhancements to the existing techniques are necessary for more accurate results. Future work will focus on refining or adapting patterns based on the structure of the Qur’an translation using LLMs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hajj; Ner; Ontology Learning; Pattern-based; Qur’an; Statistical; Adversarial Machine Learning; Federated Learning; Ontology; Structured Query Language; Comparative Evaluations; Hajj; Learning Techniques; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology Learning; Ontology's; Pattern-based; Qur’an; Statistical; Term Relationship; Contrastive Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Ontology; Structured Query Language; Comparative evaluations; Hajj; Learning techniques; Named entity recognition; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Pattern-based; Qur’an; Statistical; Term relationship; Contrastive Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001634948"

By relying on an ontological formalization of moral values as in the Basic Human Values theory, which is based on the Description and Situation Ontology Design Pattern, the sandra neuro-symbolic reasoner is used to infer values (formalized as descriptions) that are satisfied by a certain sentence. Sentences, alongside their structured representation, are automatically generated using an open-source Large Language Model. The inferred descriptions are used to automatically detect the value associated with a sentence. We show that only relying on the reasoner’s inference results in explainable classification comparable to other more complex approaches.

In recent years, various digital work instruction (DWI) technologies have become available that provide shop-floor employees with information during their activities, e.g., sequences of instructions for tasks at hand. Engineering new instructions in these systems for new products or product variants is however expensive and time-consuming. To scale up, there is a need for methods to generate work instructions (semi) automatically. Recently, Generative AI models and Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken center stage with their abilities to interact fluently with humans, both in understanding user questions/statements and in convincingly producing natural language texts. These models however suffer from several problems, including hallucinations where unsubstantiated content is presented as facts and lack of domain-specific data about products and procedures. For instruction generation however, we need verifiably correct statements about the task at hand. To tackle both problems, we have created a pipeline that combines the generative abilities of LLMs with explicit domain-specific data. We deploy a variant of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and incorporate an ontology that augments the instructions with additional information (policies, warnings, tools).

However, the absence of structured knowledge necessitates a heavy reliance on experienced managers or experts for construction safety management. This dependence on manual formulation of rectification measures results in inefficient safety management and underutilization of data value. This study proposes a knowledge graph based approach for the safety hazards inspections and recommendation of rectification measures, which consists of four steps: (1) constructing the semantic expression framework of safety hazard ontology for information extraction; (2) extracting entities from textual and semi-structured data using a large language model (ChatGLM-6B); (3) knowledge fusion and inference; (4) storing structured knowledge and developing semantic retrieval and safety hazard rectification measures recommendation. The proposed method was validated in a hydropower project, where a knowledge graph of safety hazards was constructed, consisting of 108,000 entities and 121 relationships. The results demonstrate that this method can automatically provide targeted rectification measures for safety hazards such as fire, falls from heights, scaffold collapse and electric shock. This work can provide a practical reference for improving the effectiveness of the construction project safety management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Intelligent Recommendation; Knowledge Graph; Safety Hazards; Safety Management; Information Management; Project Management; Scaffolds; Semantics; Construction Safety; Construction Sites; Data Values; Graph-based; Hazard Management; Intelligent Recommendation; Knowledge Graphs; Safety Hazards; Safety Management; Structured Knowledge; Knowledge Graph","Information management; Project management; Scaffolds; Semantics; Construction safety; Construction sites; Data values; Graph-based; Hazard management; Intelligent recommendation; Knowledge graphs; Safety hazards; Safety management; Structured knowledge; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000670719"

However, LLMs’ context-sensitivity can hinder obtaining precise and task-aligned outcomes, thereby requiring prompt engineering. This study explores the efficacy of five prompt methods with different task demonstration strategies across 17 different prompt templates, utilizing a relation extraction dataset (RED-FM) with the aforementioned LLMs. To facilitate evaluation, we introduce a novel framework grounded in Wikidata’s ontology. The findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of extracting a diverse array of facts from text. Notably, incorporating a simple instruction accompanied by a task demonstration – comprising three examples selected via a retrieval mechanism – significantly enhances performance across Mistral 7B, Llama 3, and GPT-4. The effectiveness of reasoning-oriented prompting methods such as Chain-of-Thought, Reasoning and Acting, while improved with task demonstrations, does not surpass alternative methods. This suggests that framing extraction as a reasoning task may not be necessary for KE.

It facilitates multi-modal interaction with human users through speech, sign language, and physical interaction, fostering a human-in-the-loop learning paradigm. By acquiring new knowledge through verbal communication and mastering manipulation skills via human-lead-through programming, UJI-Butler enhances transparency and trust by incorporating human feedback during operations. Experimental results demonstrate that UJI-Butler’s combination of symbolic and non-symbolic AI offers intuitive interaction and accelerates the learning process with experience. It adeptly stores and utilizes knowledge gained from verbal communication, recognizing hand gestures for requests. Additionally, UJI-Butler successfully performs user-taught physical skills and generalizes them to varying object sizes and locations. The explicit nature of acquired knowledge enables seamless transferability to other platforms and modification by human users.

Significant gaps in data and knowledge integration can hinder vaccine development which relies on a comprehensive understanding of the interplay between pathogens and the host immune system. In this review, we explore the current landscape of vaccine development, highlighting the computational challenges, limitations, and opportunities associated with integrating diverse data types for leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) techniques in vaccine design. We discuss the role of natural language processing, semantic integration, and causal inference in extracting valuable insights from published literature and unstructured data sources, as well as the computational modeling of immune responses. Furthermore, we highlight specific challenges associated with uncertainty quantification in vaccine development and emphasize the importance of establishing standardized data formats and ontologies to facilitate the integration and analysis of heterogeneous data. Through data harmonization and integration, the development of safe and effective vaccines can be accelerated to improve public health outcomes.

Annotating biological text, such as observed phenotype descriptions, with ontology terms is a challenging and tedious task. The process of annotation requires a contextual understanding of the input text and of the ontological terms available. While text-mining tools are available to assist, they are largely based on directly matching words and phrases and so lack understanding of the meaning of the query item and of the ontology term labels. Large Language Models (LLMs), however, excel at tasks that require semantic understanding of input text and therefore may provide an improvement for the auto-annotation of text with ontological terms. Here we describe a series of workflows incorporating OpenAI GPT's capabilities to annotate Arabidopsis thaliana and forest tree phenotypic observations with ontology terms, aiming for results that resemble manually curated annotations. These workflows make use of an LLM to intelligently parse phenotypes into short concepts, followed by finding appropriate ontology terms via embedding vector similarity or via Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The RAG model is a state-of-the-art approach that augments conversational prompts to the LLM with context-specific data to empower it beyond its pre-trained parameter space. We show that the RAG produces the most accurate automated annotations that are often highly similar or identical to expert-curated annotations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annotation; Gpt; Large Language Model; Ontology; Phenotype; Rag","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000452266"

This paper proposes a biomedical document recommendation strategy that realizes informative term generation using the encompassment of extraction of terms and categories and the TF-IDF. The framework also generates an ontology from the informative terms harvested from which features are selected to classify the dataset using a random forest classifier. The model also uses very strong knowledge bases that are highly specific to the domain like QIAGEN. It also uses WikiData which is generic but has a full cover of world knowledge to bridge the knowledge present in the datasets and the existing structure web. Metadata generation also increases the quantity of additional knowledge that is encompassed in the model. BioBERT is a strategic large language model that focuses on biosciences and biomedicine as its domain is used to classify the metadata to make it more permeable into the model. Semantic similarity is computed using NPMI, web overlap, SimRank, and Ricklefs and Lau index at different stages in the pipeline to facilitate quantitative reasoning through semantic relatedness computation. The salient semantic analysis also accelerates the overall semantic association into the proposed framework. This framework can demonstrate a precision of 96.56%, recall of 96.93%, and an FDR of 0.04. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Document; Document Recommendation; Large Language Model; Ontology; Ricklefs And Lau Index; Classification (of Information); Decision Trees; Domain Knowledge; Metadata; Recommender Systems; Semantics; Biomedical Documents; Document Recommendation; Informative Terms; Language Model; Large Language Model; Medical Science; Ontology's; Recommendation Strategies; Ricklefs And Lau Index; Web 3.0; Ontology","Classification (of information); Decision trees; Domain Knowledge; Metadata; Recommender systems; Semantics; Biomedical documents; Document recommendation; Informative terms; Language model; Large language model; Medical science; Ontology's; Recommendation strategies; Ricklefs and lau index; Web 3.0; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000227034"

Ontologies as knowledgebases have been heavily applied in computational biological studies by implementing into ML models for purposes such as disease-gene associations identification. Method. We conduct a case study using gene ontology (GO) annotation data and three ML models to replicate the prediction of autism spectrum disorder (ASD)-causing genes. Analysis. Data were collected from GO and Simmons Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI). The semantic similarities between GO annotation terms on gene products were calculated. Results. The best-performing model can reach an AUC of .85, which means using GO annotation data for ASD disease-gene prediction can receive a significantly accurate result. However, we stress the importance of constructing knowledgebases in adapting to LLMs and the role of LIS professionals in curating community knowledge for interoperability and reuse. Conclusion. Biomedical ontologies play a crucial role in the discovery of biomedical knowledge.

Machine learning (ML)-guided prediction of antigen-specific B cells could accelerate this process but requires sufficient training data with antigen-specificity labeling. Here, we introduce a dataset of single-cell transcriptome and antibody repertoire sequencing of B cells from immunized mice, which are labeled as antigen specific or non-specific through experimental selections. We identify gene expression patterns associated with antigen specificity by differential gene expression analysis and assess their antibody sequence diversity. Subsequently, we benchmark various ML models, both linear and non-linear, trained on different combinations of gene expression and antibody repertoire features. Additionally, we assess transfer learning using features from general and antibody-specific protein language models (PLMs).

However, the complexity of buildings and the iterative nature of simulation poses challenges, leading to high costs and low values. Previous studies focused on simplification, but did not fully utilize advanced simulation engines.

Therefore, this study proposes a GPT-based BPS system, enhancing simulation efficiency and value by integrating simulation engines and advanced data analytics in the GPT environment. The ontology for GPT-based BPS is also developed to enable comprehensive, reliable, informative BPS environments. Based on this framework, case studies were conducted for GPT-based multizone airflow network simulation in a high-rise residential building using CONTAM software. They demonstrate GPT's capabilities in retrieving simulation data, visualizing results with data mining, answering questions based on building knowledge, checking compliance with design guidelines, and proposing design alternatives.

Antigen presentation on MHC class I (MHC-I) is crucial for the adaptive immune response to cancer cells, necessitating highly predictive computational methods to model this phenomenon. Here, we introduce HLApollo, a transformer-based model for peptide-MHC-I (pMHC-I) presentation prediction, leveraging the language of peptides, MHC, and source proteins. HLApollo provides end-to-end treatment of MHC-I sequences and deconvolution of multi-allelic data, using a negative-set switching strategy to mitigate misassigned negatives in unlabelled ligandome data. HLApollo shows a 12.65% increase in average precision (AP) on ligandome data and a 4.1% AP increase on immunogenicity test data compared to next-best models. Incorporating protein features from protein language models yields further gains and reduces the need for gene expression measurements.

This is not only because it describes the patient’s situation. It also contains relevant information about the patient’s context and health state evolution. Narratives are usually vague and cannot be categorized easily. On the other hand, once the patient’s situation is correctly identified based on a narrative, it is then possible to map the patient’s situation into precise classification schemas and ontologies that are machine-readable. To this end, language models can be trained to read and extract elements from these narratives. However, the main problem is the lack of data for model identification and model training in languages other than English. First, gold standard annotations are usually not available due to the high level of data protection for patient data. Second, gold standard annotations (if available) are difficult to access. Alternative available data, like MIMIC (Sci Data 3:1, 2016) is written in English and for specific patient conditions like intensive care. Thus, when model training is required for other types of patients, like oncology (and not intensive care), this could lead to bias. To facilitate clinical narrative model training, a method for creating high-quality synthetic narratives is needed. Method: We devised workflows based on generative AI methods to synthesize narratives in the German language to avoid the disclosure of patient’s health data. Since we required highly realistic narratives, we generated prompts, written with high-quality medical terminology, asking for clinical narratives containing both a main and co-disease. The frequency of distribution of both the main and co-disease was extracted from the hospital’s structured data, such that the synthetic narratives reflect the disease distribution among the patient’s cohort. In order to validate the quality of the synthetic narratives, we annotated them to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) algorithm. According to our assumptions, the validation of this system implies that the synthesized data used for its training are of acceptable quality. Result: We report precision, recall and F1 score for the NER model while also considering metrics that take into account both exact and partial entity matches. Trained models are cautious, with a precision up to 0.8 for Entity Type match metric and a F1 score of 0.3. Conclusion: Despite its inherent limitations, this technology has the potential to allow data interoperability by using encoded diseases across languages and regions without compromising data safety. Additionally, it facilitates the synthesis of unstructured patient data. In this way, the identification and training of models can be accelerated. We believe that this method may be able to generate discharge letters for any combination of main and co-diseases, which will significantly reduce the amount of time spent writing these letters by healthcare professionals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generative Ai; Language Models; Non-english Language Models; Synthetic Data; Synthetic Narratives; Artificial Intelligence; Human; Natural Language Processing; Verbal Communication; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Narration; Natural Language Processing","artificial intelligence; human; natural language processing; verbal communication; Artificial Intelligence; Humans; Narration; Natural Language Processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213549719"

Addressing the variability in clinical outcome reports and integrating semantically similar outcomes is important in healthcare and clinical research. Variability in outcome reporting not only hinders the comparability of clinical trial results but also poses significant challenges in evidence synthesis, meta-analysis, and evidence-based decision-making. Methods: This study investigates variability reduction in outcome measures reporting using rule-based and large language-based models. It aims to mitigate the challenges associated with variability in outcome reporting by comparing these two models. The first approach, which is rule-based, will leverage well-known ontologies, and the second approach exploits sentence-bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (SBERT) to identify semantically similar outcomes along with Generative Pre-training Transformer (GPT) to refine the results. Results: The results show that the relatively low percentages of outcomes are linked to established rule-based ontologies. Analysis of outcomes by word count highlighted the absence of ontological linkage for three-word outcomes, which indicates potential gaps in semantic representation. Conclusions: Employing large language models (LLMs), this study demonstrates its ability to identify similar outcomes, even with more than three words, suggesting a crucial role in outcome harmonization efforts, potentially reducing redundancy and enhancing data interoperability. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Outcome; Large Language Model; Ontology; Semantic Variability","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213514159"

Previous methods mainly focused on protein sequence features, overlooking the semantic meaning of protein labels. Results: We introduce functional annotation of proteins using multimodal models (FAPM), a contrastive multimodal model that links natural language with protein sequence language. This model combines a pretrained protein sequence model with a pretrained large language model to generate labels, such as Gene Ontology (GO) functional terms and catalytic activity predictions, in natural language. Our results show that FAPM excels in understanding protein properties, outperforming models based solely on protein sequences or structures. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmarks and in-house experimentally annotated phage proteins, which often have few known homologs. Additionally, FAPM’s flexibility allows it to incorporate extra text prompts, like taxonomy information, enhancing both its predictive performance and explainability. This novel approach offers a promising alternative to current methods that rely on multiple sequence alignment for protein annotation.

It was known that the use of LLMs can successfully extract symptoms and findings, but cannot annotate them with the HPO. We hypothesized that one of the potential issue for this is the lack of appropriate terms in the HPO. Therefore, during the Biomedical Linked Annotation Hackathon 8 (BLAH8), we attempted the following two tasks in order to grasp the overall picture of HPO. (1) Extract all HPO terms for each of the 23 HPO subclasses (defined as categories) directly under the HPO ""Phenotypic abnormality"" and then (2) search for major attributes in each of 23 categories. We employed LLM for these two tasks related to examining HPO and, at the same time, found that LLM didn't work well without ingenuity for tasks that lacked sentences and context. A manual search for terms within each category revealed that the HPO contains a mix of terms with four major attributes: (1) Disease Name, (2) Condition, (3) Test Data, and (4) Symptoms and Findings. Manual curation showed that the ratio of symptoms and findings varied from 0 to 93.1% across categories. For clinicians, who are end-users of medical terminology including HPO, it is difficult to understand ontologies. However, for good quality ontology is also important for good-quality data, and a clinician’s help is essential. It is also important to make the overall picture and limitations of ontologies easy to understand in order to bring out the explanatory power of LLMs and artificial intelligence. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annotation; Biological Ontologies; Large Language Model; Phenotype","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209785282"

Over the years, significant progress has been made in RSLE: sensing approaches such as field investigation and remote sensing offers a comprehensive overview necessary for real-time disaster response, while simulation techniques such as the methodology proposed in Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) P-58 series provide insights into the mechanism of disaster development and its potential long-term impacts on urban assets. Nonetheless, challenges persist in the realm of practical RSLE applications. Firstly, a dynamic understanding of a disaster event and its influence is deemed important for effective emergency responses while challenging to achieve in current approaches. Secondly, stakeholders with varying roles, including administrators, rescue teams and ordinary citizens have distinct information requirements for RSLE. Thirdly, the complexity of seismic loss estimation, involving diverse data sources such as building information models, performance models, fragility data and sensor observations, poses interoperability issue. To tackle these issues, this article introduces a dynamic, multi-granularity, ontological representation scheme tailored for RSLE decision-supporting systems. This scheme operates across various scales, from individual building components to broader regional scales by synergistically employing FEMA P-58 guidelines and Semantic Web technologies. Upon the corresponding semantics, a question-and-answer agent powered by large language model is further developed to facilitate interaction requirements within the RSLE process via FEMA P-58 pipeline. The practical efficacy of this approach is validated through a prototype deployed under a real earthquake event, demonstrating its value in real-world scenarios. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dynamic Regional Seismic Loss Estimation; Fema P-58; Large Language Model; Mainshock-aftershock Sequence; Semantic Web; Digital Elevation Model; Earthquake Effects; Metadata; Risk Management; Seismic Response; Aftershock Sequence; Dynamic Regional Seismic Loss Estimation; Federal Emergency Management Agency; Federal Emergency Management Agency P-58; Language Model; Large Language Model; Main Shock; Mainshock-aftershock Sequence; Seismic Loss Estimation; Semantic-web; Semantics","Digital elevation model; Earthquake effects; Metadata; Risk management; Seismic response; Aftershock sequence; Dynamic regional seismic loss estimation; Federal Emergency Management Agency; Federal emergency management agency P-58; Language model; Large language model; Main shock; Mainshock-aftershock sequence; Seismic loss estimation; Semantic-Web; Semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209645399"

It requires an objective and rational interpretation of fire regulations. However, the texts of fire regulations are filled with numerous rules related to spatial limitations, which pose a significant challenge in interpreting them. The current method of interpreting these rules mostly relies on manual translation, which is not efficient. To address this issue, this study proposes an innovative automated framework for interpreting rules by combining ontology technology with natural language processing (NLP). Through the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs), concepts and relationships are extracted from sentences, a domain-specific ontology is established, spatial knowledge is transformed into language-agnostic tree structures based on the ontology, and the semantic components of spatial relationships are extracted. The tree structure is then mapped to logical clauses based on semantic consistency, thereby improving the efficiency of interpretation. Experimental results demonstrate that the architecture achieves an F1 score of 86.27 for entity extraction and 81.81 for spatial relationship joint extraction tasks, with an accuracy of 96.26% in the formalization of logical rules, highlighting its proficiency in automatically interpreting fire spatial rules.

Methods: We developed an AI system for epilepsy diagnosis using Protégé with OWL/SWRL, integrating a knowledge base with seizure semiology, seizure types EEG descriptors, expert insights, and literature to pinpoint seizure locations. A customized GPT model was then tailored for specific diagnostic needs. Validated through 16 surgical cases, the system's accuracy in seizure localization and the JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) Epilepsy Matcher's term matching capabilities were confirmed against a Protégé-based knowledge base. Results: A total of 117 patients with PRE underwent video-EEG monitoring at a single institution. However, only 16 of these patients received epilepsy surgery. The Protégé system achieved 75 % accuracy in diagnosing epilepsy from 16 cases using semiology, which increased to 87.5 % with EEG data. The Json Epilepsy Matcher further improved accuracy to 87.5 % with symptoms alone and 93.8 % when including EEG data, highlighting the benefits of applying GPT techniques. Conclusions: This study highlights the efficacy of the JSON Epilepsy Matcher in improving seizure diagnosis accuracy. When combined with EEG data, it achieves a 93.8 % accuracy rate, suggesting a potential improvement in the practicality and generalizability of the original ontology expert system, boosting physicians’ confidence in confirming surgery and potentially sparing many children from prolonged suffering.

The experiment is divided into three groups, each with three replicates, and each replicate contains 30 fish. We employed a comprehensive approach integrating histology, physiological and biochemical assays, transcriptomics, as well as artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted analysis. This multifaceted method allowed us to examine changes in gill and liver morphology, osmoregulation, antioxidant capacity, immune response, and physiological metabolism. Results showed that gill and liver tissue damage increased with rising water alkalinity. Serum sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), blood ammonia, and gill Na+/K+-ATPase (NKA) levels increased significantly (p < 0.05). Hepatic antioxidant enzymes initially increased, then decreased with prolonged stress. Serum and liver immunoenzyme indices were higher in bicarbonate-treated groups compared to controls. Carbonate treatment altered lipid and glucose metabolism in both serum and liver. Transcriptome analysis, enhanced by large language models (LLMs), revealed differentially expressed genes (DEGs) significantly associated with ion binding, transport, apoptosis, and metabolism. In conclusion, excessive carbonate intake in fish alters serum physiological functions and affects hepatic metabolic functions. Crucian carp primarily regulate hepatic antioxidant systems, utilize carbohydrate breakdown for energy requirements, and employ lipids in osmoregulation.

This methodology guides the design and implementation of AAS models, ensuring model properties are presented in a unified structure and reference external standardized vocabularies to maintain consistency across different systems. To automate this referencing process, we propose a novel LLM-based algorithm to semantically search model properties within a standardized vocabulary repository. This algorithm significantly reduces manual intervention in model development. A case study in the injection molding domain demonstrates the practical application of our approach, showcasing the integration and linking of product quality and machine process data with the help of the developed AAS models. Statistical evaluation of our LLM-based semantic search algorithm confirms its efficacy in enhancing data interoperability. This methodology offers a scalable and adaptable solution for various industrial use cases, promoting widespread data interoperability in the context of Industry 4.0. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset Administration Shell; Industry 4.0; Information Modelling; Interoperability; Large Language Model; Ontology; Quality Control; Zero Defect Manufacturing; Network Security; Steganography; Asset Administration Shell; Data Interoperability; Information Modeling; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model Properties; Ontology's; Shell Models; Zero Defect Manufacturing; Zero Defects; Statistical Process Control","Network security; Steganography; Asset administration shell; Data interoperability; Information Modeling; Language model; Large language model; Model properties; Ontology's; Shell models; Zero defect manufacturing; Zero defects; Statistical process control","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207646345"

However, their construction and maintenance demand substantial resources and necessitate substantial collaboration between domain experts, curators, and ontology experts. We present Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation of Ontologies using AI (DRAGON-AI), an ontology generation method employing Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). DRAGON-AI can generate textual and logical ontology components, drawing from existing knowledge in multiple ontologies and unstructured text sources. Results: We assessed performance of DRAGON-AI on de novo term construction across ten diverse ontologies, making use of extensive manual evaluation of results. Our method has high precision for relationship generation, but has slightly lower precision than from logic-based reasoning. Our method is also able to generate definitions deemed acceptable by expert evaluators, but these scored worse than human-authored definitions. Notably, evaluators with the highest level of confidence in a domain were better able to discern flaws in AI-generated definitions. We also demonstrated the ability of DRAGON-AI to incorporate natural language instructions in the form of GitHub issues. Conclusions: These findings suggest DRAGON-AI's potential to substantially aid the manual ontology construction process. However, our results also underscore the importance of having expert curators and ontology editors drive the ontology generation process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Biocuration; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Ontologies; Ontology Engineering; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Ontology; Information Retrieval; Natural Language Processing; Procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Ontologies; Information Storage And Retrieval; Natural Language Processing","artificial intelligence; biological ontology; information retrieval; natural language processing; procedures; Artificial Intelligence; Biological Ontologies; Information Storage and Retrieval; Natural Language Processing","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206568005"

Unstructured clinical notes contain valuable information for identifying rare diseases, but manual curation is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. This study aims to develop a hybrid approach combining dictionary-based natural language processing (NLP) tools with large language models (LLMs) to improve rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. Methods: We propose a novel hybrid framework that integrates the Orphanet Rare Disease Ontology (ORDO) and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) to create a comprehensive rare disease vocabulary. SemEHR, a dictionary-based NLP tool, is employed to extract rare disease mentions from clinical notes. To refine the results and improve accuracy, we leverage various LLMs, including LLaMA3, Phi3-mini, and domain-specific models like OpenBioLLM and BioMistral. Different prompting strategies, such as zero-shot, few-shot, and knowledge-augmented generation, are explored to optimize the LLMs’ performance. Results: The proposed hybrid approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional NLP systems and standalone LLMs. LLaMA3 and Phi3-mini achieve the highest F1 scores in rare disease identification. Few-shot prompting with 1-3 examples yields the best results, while knowledge-augmented generation shows limited improvement. Notably, the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not documented in structured diagnostic records, highlighting its ability to identify previously unrecognized patients. Conclusion: The hybrid approach combining dictionary-based NLP tools with LLMs shows great promise for improving rare disease identification from unstructured clinical reports. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, the method demonstrates superior performance and the potential to uncover hidden rare disease cases. Further research is needed to address limitations related to ontology mapping and overlapping case identification, and to integrate the approach into clinical practice for early diagnosis and improved patient outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Health Record; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Phenotyping; Biological Ontology; Diagnosis; Electronic Health Record; Human; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Rare Disease; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","biological ontology; diagnosis; electronic health record; human; natural language processing; phenotype; rare disease; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205771843"

They shared similar symptoms and many common features in pathogenesis. Our study aims to perform a comprehensive analysis between RA and AF and identify novel drugs for clinical use. Based on the text mining approaches, we performed a correlation analysis of 12 common joint diseases including arthrofibrosis, gouty arthritis, infectious arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, osteoarthritis, post infectious arthropathies, post traumatic osteoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, septic arthritis, and transient arthritis. 5 bulk sequencing datasets and 4 single-cell sequencing datasets of RA and AF were integrated and analyzed. A novel drug repositioning method was found for drug screening, and text mining approaches were used to verify the identified drugs. RA and AF performed the highest gene similarity (0.77) and functional ontology similarity (0.84) among all 12 joint diseases. We figured out that they share the same key pathogenic cell including CD34 + sublining fibroblasts (CD34-SLF) and DKK3 + sublining fibroblasts (DKK3-SLF). Potential therapeutic target database (PTTD) was established with the differential expressed genes (DEGs) of these key pathogenic cells. Based on the PTTD, 15 potential drugs for AF and 16 potential drugs for RA were identified.

They stimulate the immune system and generate memory cells to defend against targeted diseases. Clinical trials evaluate vaccine performance, including dosage, administration routes, and potential side effects. ClinicalTrials.gov is a valuable repository of clinical trial information, but the vaccine data in them lacks standardization, leading to challenges in automatic concept mapping, vaccine-related knowledge development, evidence-based decision-making, and vaccine surveillance. Results: In this study, we developed a cascaded framework that capitalized on multiple domain knowledge sources, including clinical trials, the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), and the Vaccine Ontology (VO), to enhance the performance of domain-specific language models for automated mapping of VO from clinical trials. The Vaccine Ontology (VO) is a community-based ontology that was developed to promote vaccine data standardization, integration, and computer-assisted reasoning. Our methodology involved extracting and annotating data from various sources. We then performed pre-training on the PubMedBERT model, leading to the development of CTPubMedBERT. Subsequently, we enhanced CTPubMedBERT by incorporating SAPBERT, which was pretrained using the UMLS, resulting in CTPubMedBERT + SAPBERT. Further refinement was accomplished through fine-tuning using the Vaccine Ontology corpus and vaccine data from clinical trials, yielding the CTPubMedBERT + SAPBERT + VO model. Finally, we utilized a collection of pre-trained models, along with the weighted rule-based ensemble approach, to normalize the vaccine corpus and improve the accuracy of the process. The ranking process in concept normalization involves prioritizing and ordering potential concepts to identify the most suitable match for a given context. We conducted a ranking of the Top 10 concepts, and our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed cascaded framework consistently outperformed existing effective baselines on vaccine mapping, achieving 71.8% on top 1 candidate’s accuracy and 90.0% on top 10 candidate’s accuracy. Conclusion: This study provides a detailed insight into a cascaded framework of fine-tuned domain-specific language models improving mapping of VO from clinical trials. By effectively leveraging domain-specific information and applying weighted rule-based ensembles of different pre-trained BERT models, our framework can significantly enhance the mapping of VO from clinical trials. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Trials; Domain-specific Language Models; Normalization; Vaccine Ontology; Vaccines; Vaccine; Biological Ontology; Clinical Trial (topic); Human; Immunology; Natural Language Processing; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Clinical Trials As Topic; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Vaccines","vaccine; biological ontology; clinical trial (topic); human; immunology; natural language processing; Unified Medical Language System; Biological Ontologies; Clinical Trials as Topic; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Vaccines","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200874420"

Conclusion: Use of natural language models like PubMedBERT and resources such as ChEBI and PubChem provide a beneficial way to link entity mentions to ontology terms, while further supporting downstream tasks like filtering ChEBI mentions based on roles and assertions to find beneficial therapies for Alzheimer’s and dementia. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alzheimer; Chebi; Dementia; Entity Normalization; Ontology; Alzheimer Disease; Biological Ontology; Dementia; Drug Therapy; Human; Metabolism; Natural Language Processing; Translational Research; Alzheimer Disease; Biological Ontologies; Dementia; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Translational Research, Biomedical","Alzheimer disease; biological ontology; dementia; drug therapy; human; metabolism; natural language processing; translational research; Alzheimer Disease; Biological Ontologies; Dementia; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Translational Research, Biomedical","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200034968"

The engineer or designer can use LLMs to explore, validate, and compare thousands of generated conceptual stimuli and make final choices. This was seen as a significant stride in advancing the status of the generative approach in computer-aided design. However, it is often difficult to instruct LLMs to obtain novel conceptual solutions and requirement-compliant in real design tasks, due to the lack of transparency and insufficient controllability of LLMs. This study presents an approach to leverage LLMs to infer Function-Behavior-Structure (FBS) ontology for high-quality design concepts. Prompting design based on the FBS model decomposes the design task into three sub-tasks including functional, behavioral, and structural reasoning. In each sub-task, prompting templates and specification signifiers are specified to guide the LLMs to generate concepts. User can determine the selected concepts by judging and evaluating the generated function-structure pairs. A comparative experiment has been conducted to evaluate the concept generation approach. According to the concept evaluation results, our approach achieves the highest scores in concept evaluation, and the generated concepts are more novel, useful, functional, and low cost compared to the baseline. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conceptual Design; Creativity And Concept Generation; Fbs Model; Generative Design; Large Language Model; Machine Learning; Architectural Design; Computational Linguistics; Computer Aided Design; Function Evaluation; Machine Learning; Ontology; Structural Design; Concept Generation; Creativity And Concept Generation; Design Tasks; Function-behavior-structure Model; Function-behaviour-structure Ontologies; Generative Design; Language Model; Large Language Model; Machine-learning; Subtask; Conceptual Design","Architectural design; Computational linguistics; Computer aided design; Function evaluation; Machine learning; Ontology; Structural design; Concept generation; Creativity and concept generation; Design tasks; Function-behavior-structure model; Function-Behaviour-Structure ontologies; Generative design; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Subtask; Conceptual design","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199391540"

To represent a function of proteins, Gene Ontology (GO), a controlled vocabulary, is frequently used, because it is easy to handle by computer programs avoiding open-ended text interpretation. Particularly, the majority of current protein function prediction methods rely on GO terms. However, the extensive list of GO terms that describe a protein function can pose challenges for biologists when it comes to interpretation. In response to this issue, we developed GO2Sum (Gene Ontology terms Summarizer), a model that takes a set of GO terms as input and generates a human-readable summary using the T5 large language model. GO2Sum was developed by fine-tuning T5 on GO term assignments and free-text function descriptions for UniProt entries, enabling it to recreate function descriptions by concatenating GO term descriptions. Our results demonstrated that GO2Sum significantly outperforms the original T5 model that was trained on the entire web corpus in generating Function, Subunit Structure, and Pathway paragraphs for UniProt entries. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Protein; Gene Ontology; Genetics; Human; Software; Gene Ontology; Humans; Proteins; Software","protein; gene ontology; genetics; human; software; Gene Ontology; Humans; Proteins; Software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187902454"

We have become habituated to accept the use of well-constructed language to indicate intelligence, understanding and, consequently, intention, whether conscious or unconscious. But we are not always right to do so, and certainly not in the case of large language models (LLMs) like ChapGPT, GPT-4, LLaMA, and Google Bard. This is a perennial problem, but when one understands why it occurs, it ceases to be surprising that it so stubbornly persists. This paper will have three main sections. In the Introduction I will say a little about language, its aetiology, and useful sub-divisions into natural and cultural. In the second section I will explain the current situation with regard to large language models and fill in the background debates which set the problem up as one of increased complexity rather than one of a qualitatively different kind from narrow or specific AI. In the third section I will present the case for the missing phenomenological background and why it is necessary for the co-creation of shared meaning in both natural and cultural language, and I will conclude this section by presenting a rationale for why this situation arises and will continue to arise. Before we do any of this, I need to clarify one point: I do not wish to challenge the ascription of artificial general intelligence (AGI) to LLMs, indeed I think agnosticism is best in this respect, but I do challenge the more serious, and erroneous, ascription of understanding, intention, reason, and consciousness to them. And so, I am making two points: an epistemological one about why we fall into error in our ascription of a mental life to LLMs, and an ontological one about the impossibility of LLMs being or becoming conscious. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186607622"

These processes rely on using ontology concepts, often from the Human Phenotype Ontology, in conjunction with a phenotype concept recognition task (supported usually by machine learning methods) to curate patient profiles or existing scientific literature. With the significant shift in the use of large language models (LLMs) for most NLP tasks, we examine the performance of the latest Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models underpinning ChatGPT as a foundation for the tasks of clinical phenotyping and phenotype annotation. Materials and methods: The experimental setup of the study included seven prompts of various levels of specificity, two GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo and gpt-4.0) and two established gold standard corpora for phenotype recognition, one consisting of publication abstracts and the other clinical observations. Results: The best run, using in-context learning, achieved 0.58 document-level F1 score on publication abstracts and 0.75 document-level F1 score on clinical observations, as well as a mention-level F1 score of 0.7, which surpasses the current best in class tool. Without in-context learning, however, performance is significantly below the existing approaches. Conclusion: Our experiments show that gpt-4.0 surpasses the state of the art performance if the task is constrained to a subset of the target ontology where there is prior knowledge of the terms that are expected to be matched. While the results are promising, the non-deterministic nature of the outcomes, the high cost and the lack of concordance between different runs using the same prompt and input make the use of these LLMs challenging for this particular task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Generative Pretrained Transformer; Human Phenotype Ontology; Large Language Models; Phenotype Concept Recognition; Human; Knowledge; Language; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Rare Disease; Humans; Knowledge; Language; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","human; knowledge; language; machine learning; phenotype; rare disease; Humans; Knowledge; Language; Machine Learning; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85183914608"

Our approach uses domain knowledge to improve the quality of business process models (BPMs) by exploiting the domain knowledge provided by large language models (LLMs). Among these models, ChatGPT stands out as a notable example of an LLM capable of providing in-depth domain knowledge. The lack of coverage presents a limitation in each approach, as it hinders the ability to fully capture and represent the domain’s knowledge. To solve such limitations, we aim to exploit GPT-3.5 knowledge. Our approach does not ask GPT-3.5 to create a visual representation; instead, it needs to suggest missing concepts, thus helping the modeler improve his/her model. The GPT-3.5 may need to refine its suggestions based on feedback from the modeler. Design/methodology/approach: We initiate our semantic quality enhancement process of a BPM by first extracting crucial elements including pools, lanes, activities and artifacts, along with their corresponding relationships such as lanes being associated with pools, activities belonging to each lane and artifacts associated with each activity. These data are systematically gathered and structured into ArrayLists, a form of organized collection that allows for efficient data manipulation and retrieval. Once we have this structured data, our methodology involves creating a series of prompts based on each data element. We adopt three approaches to prompting: zero-shot, few-shot and chain of thoughts (CoT) prompts. Each type of prompting is specifically designed to interact with the OpenAI language model in a unique way, aiming to elicit a diverse array of suggestions. As we apply these prompting techniques, the OpenAI model processes each prompt and returns a list of suggestions tailored to that specific element of the BPM. Our approach operates independently of any specific notation and offers semi-automation, allowing modelers to select from a range of suggested options. Findings: This study demonstrates the significant potential of prompt engineering techniques in enhancing the semantic quality of BPMs when integrated with LLMs like ChatGPT. Our analysis of model activity richness and model artifact richness across different prompt techniques and input configurations reveals that carefully tailored prompts can lead to more complete BPMs. This research is a step forward for further exploration into the optimization of LLMs in BPM development. Research limitations/implications: The limitation is the domain ontology that we are relying on to evaluate the semantic completeness of the new BPM. In our future work, the modeler will have the option to ask for synonyms, hyponyms, hypernyms or keywords. This feature will facilitate the replacement of existing concepts to improve not only the completeness of the BPM but also the clarity and specificity of concepts in BPMs. Practical implications: To demonstrate our methodology, we take the “Hospitalization” process as an illustrative example. In the scope of our research, we have presented a select set of instructions pertinent to the “chain of thought” and “few-shot prompting.” Due to constraints in presentation and the extensive nature of the instructions, we have not included every detail within the body of this paper. However, they can be found in the previous GitHub link. Two appendices are given at the end. Appendix 1 describes the different prompt instructions. Appendix 2 presents the application of the instructions in our example. Originality/value: In our research, we rely on the domain application knowledge provided by ChatGPT-3 to enhance the semantic quality of BPMs. Typically, the semantic quality of BPMs may suffer due to the modeler's lack of domain knowledge. To address this issue, our approach employs three prompt engineering methods designed to extract accurate domain knowledge. By utilizing these methods, we can identify and propose missing concepts, such as activities and artifacts. This not only ensures a more comprehensive representation of the business process but also contributes to the overall improvement of the model's semantic quality, leading to more effective and accurate business process management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Business Process Improvement; Business Process Modeling; Business Process Redesign; Prompt Engineering; Semantic Quality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201561386"

Analyzing and mining maritime accident cases can help uncover the causal mechanisms behind these incidents, thereby enhancing maritime safety. As an emerging technology for knowledge management and mining, knowledge graphs offer significant support for the storage, reasoning, and decision-making processes related to maritime accidents. In this study, we established a knowledge graph construction and application framework for maritime accidents to facilitates the extraction and management of maritime knowledge from unstructured texts. First, 581 accident reports released by the China Maritime Safety Administration over the past decade (2014–2023) were used as the data basis for analysis and construction of the maritime accident ontology structure using the seven-step method, which comprises 8 entity types, 8 relationship types, and 18 attribute entity types. Second, We proposed MBERT-BiLSTM-CRF-SF, a named entity recognition model based on domain pretraining and self-training, to reduce graph construction costs. This model achieved state-of-the-art performance in the maritime domain, with an F1 score of 0.910 ± 0.006, which is about 5% higher than the mainstream model. In addition, we proposed an entity alignment method based on font and semantics to refine knowledge further. On the basis of the proposed method, we constructed a large, high-quality maritime accident knowledge graph (MAKG) system that contains 16,099 entities and 20,809 relationship instances. Finally, we reduced the complexity of applying knowledge graphs by integrating the CRISPE prompt learning framework of the large language model, and experiments on graph traversal, pattern recognition, and aggregation analysis were conducted to assess the quality of MAKG. Results demonstrate that MAKG can effectively enhance the efficiency of querying and reasoning about maritime accident information, thus providing significant support for the prevention and management of maritime accidents. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Knowledge Graph; Maritime Accident; Named Entity Recognition; Prompt Learning; Decision Making; Semantics; Accident Analysis; Accident Management; Bert; Entity-types; Graph Construction; Knowledge Graphs; Maritime Accidents; Maritime Safety; Named Entity Recognition; Prompt Learning; Knowledge Graph; Accident; Accident Prevention; Complexity; Decision Making; Information System; Maritime Transportation; Performance Assessment; Transportation Safety; Transportation Technology; China","Decision making; Semantics; Accident analysis; Accident management; BERT; Entity-types; Graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Maritime accidents; Maritime safety; Named entity recognition; Prompt learning; Knowledge graph; accident; accident prevention; complexity; decision making; information system; maritime transportation; performance assessment; transportation safety; transportation technology; China","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204184779"

Understanding the intricate interactions between EBV antigens and cellular pathways is crucial to unraveling the molecular mechanisms in EBV-mediated diseases. However, fully elucidating EBV–host interactions and the associated pathogenesis remains a significant challenge. In this study, we employed large language models (LLMs) to screen 36,105 EBV-relevant scientific publications and summarize the current literature landscape on various EBV-associated diseases like Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and so on. LLM-generated data indicate that the most-studied EBV-associated pathways are enriched in immune response, apoptosis, cell growth, and replication. The analyses of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) reveal three principal EBV-related protein clusters: TP53-centered apoptotic factors, EBV-associated transcription factors, and immune response elements. Utilizing our dataset and public databases, we demonstrated that BLLF3-targeted TLR2-associated factors are effective diagnostic markers for DLBCL. Next, we confirmed the co-expression of LMP1-targeted calcium pathway factors in BL. Finally, we demonstrated the correlation and co-expression of LMP1-induced PARP1, HIF1A, HK2, and key glycolysis-related factors, further suggesting that LMP1 actively regulates the glycolysis pathway. Therefore, our study presents a comprehensive functional encyclopedia of the interactions between EBV antigens and host signaling pathways across various EBV-associated diseases, providing valuable insights for the development of therapeutic strategies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ebv; Ebv-mediated Diseases; Llm; Signaling Pathways; Host Factor; Interleukin 17; Microrna; Transcription Factor; Apoptosis; Article; Burkitt Lymphoma; Carcinogenesis; Cell Growth; Cell Proliferation; Cell Survival; Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma; Epstein Barr Virus; Epstein Barr Virus Infection; Gene Expression; Gene Mutation; Gene Ontology; Gene Silencing; Immune Response; Innate Immunity; Large Language Model; Lipid Metabolism; Mapk Signaling; Mismatch Repair; Nasopharynx Carcinoma; Nonhuman; Omics; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Pi3k/akt Signaling; Protein Homeostasis; Protein Misfolding; Protein Phosphorylation; Protein Protein Interaction; Signal Transduction; Transcription Regulation; Tumor Microenvironment; Ubiquitination; Unfolded Protein Response; Upregulation; Host Pathogen Interaction; Human; Metabolism; Physiology; Virology; Burkitt Lymphoma; Epstein-barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Host-pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-cell, Diffuse; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Protein Interaction Maps; Signal Transduction","host factor; interleukin 17; microRNA; transcription factor; apoptosis; Article; Burkitt lymphoma; carcinogenesis; cell growth; cell proliferation; cell survival; diffuse large B cell lymphoma; Epstein Barr virus; Epstein Barr virus infection; gene expression; gene mutation; gene ontology; gene silencing; immune response; innate immunity; large language model; lipid metabolism; MAPK signaling; mismatch repair; nasopharynx carcinoma; nonhuman; omics; oxidative phosphorylation; Pi3K/Akt signaling; protein homeostasis; protein misfolding; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; signal transduction; transcription regulation; tumor microenvironment; ubiquitination; unfolded protein response; upregulation; host pathogen interaction; human; metabolism; physiology; virology; Burkitt Lymphoma; Epstein-Barr Virus Infections; Herpesvirus 4, Human; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lymphoma, Large B-Cell, Diffuse; Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma; Protein Interaction Maps; Signal Transduction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210446933"

Currently, the host of the majority of viruses is unknown, particularly in microbiomes. To address this challenge, we introduce EvoMIL, a deep learning method that predicts the host species for viruses from viral sequences only. It also identifies important viral proteins that significantly contribute to host prediction. The method combines a pre-trained large protein language model (ESM) and attention-based multiple instance learning to allow protein-orientated predictions. Our results show that protein embeddings capture stronger predictive signals than sequence composition features, including amino acids, physiochemical properties, and DNA k-mers.

Integrating knowledge from various sources is crucial for studying complex biological systems. Traditional text-mining methods often have limited accuracy because they don’t capture semantic and contextual nuances. Deep-learning models can be computationally expensive and typically have low interpretability, though efforts in explainable AI aim to mitigate this. Furthermore, transformer-based models have a tendency to produce false or made-up information—a problem known as hallucination—which is especially prevalent in large language models (LLMs). This study proposes a hybrid approach combining text-mining techniques with graph neural networks (GNNs) and fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) to extend biomedical knowledge graphs and interpret predicted edges based on published literature. An LLM is used to validate predictions and provide explanations. Evaluated on a corpus of experimentally confirmed protein interactions, the approach achieved a Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.772. Applied to insomnia, the approach identified 25 interactions between 32 human proteins absent in known knowledge bases, including regulatory interactions between MAOA and 5-HT2C, binding between ADAM22 and 14-3-3 proteins, which is implicated in neurological diseases, and a circadian regulatory loop involving RORB and NR1D1. The hybrid GNN-LLM method analyzes biomedical literature efficiency to uncover potential molecular interactions for complex disorders. It can accelerate therapeutic target discovery by focusing expert verification on the most relevant automatically extracted information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Andsystem; Deep Learning; Gnn; Knowledge Graph; Llm; Text-mining; Protein 14 3 3; Adam Protein; Amine Oxidase (flavin Containing) Isoenzyme A; Nuclear Receptor Nr1d1; Protein 14 3 3; Protein Adam 22; Retinoid Related Orphan Receptor Beta; Serotonin 2c Receptor; Unclassified Drug; Accuracy; Article; Binary Classification; Circadian Rhythm; Data Mining; Graph Neural Network; Human; Insomnia; Knowledge Base; Large Language Model; Medical Literature; Multilayer Perceptron; Neurologic Disease; Prediction; Protein Binding; Protein Protein Interaction; Publication; Urban Health; Artificial Neural Network; Deep Learning; Procedures; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Neural Networks, Computer; Publications","ADAM protein; amine oxidase (flavin containing) isoenzyme A; nuclear receptor NR1D1; protein 14 3 3; protein adam 22; retinoid related orphan receptor beta; serotonin 2C receptor; unclassified drug; accuracy; Article; binary classification; circadian rhythm; data mining; graph neural network; human; insomnia; knowledge base; large language model; medical literature; multilayer perceptron; neurologic disease; prediction; protein binding; protein protein interaction; publication; urban health; artificial neural network; deep learning; procedures; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Humans; Knowledge Bases; Neural Networks, Computer; Publications","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208591467"

However, existing computational models for subcellular localization face significant challenges, such as reliance on known Gene Ontology (GO) annotation databases or overlooking the relationship between GO annotations and subcellular localization. To address these issues, we propose DeepMTC, an end-To-end deep learning-based multi-Task collaborative training model. DeepMTC integrates the interrelationship between subcellular localization and the functional annotation of proteins, leveraging multi-Task collaborative training to eliminate dependence on known GO databases. This strategy gives DeepMTC a distinct advantage in predicting newly discovered proteins without prior functional annotations. First, DeepMTC leverages pre-Trained language model with high accuracy to obtain the 3D structure and sequence features of proteins. Additionally, it employs a graph transformer module to encode protein sequence features, addressing the problem of long-range dependencies in graph neural networks. Finally, DeepMTC uses a functional cross-Attention mechanism to efficiently combine upstream learned functional features to perform the subcellular localization task. The experimental results demonstrate that DeepMTC outperforms state-of-The-Art models in both protein function prediction and subcellular localization. Moreover, interpretability experiments revealed that DeepMTC can accurately identify the key residues and functional domains of proteins, confirming its superior performance.

Although research can be challenging, large amounts of data have been captured through collaborative efforts in the International Pediatric Stroke Study (IPSS). This study explores the use of an advanced artificial intelligence program, the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), to enter pediatric stroke data into the IPSS. Methods: The most recent 50 clinical notes of patients with ischemic stroke or cerebral venous sinus thrombosis at the UTHealth Pediatric Stroke Clinic were deidentified. Domain-specific prompts were engineered for an offline artificial intelligence program (GPT) to answer IPSS questions. Responses from GPT were compared with the human rater. Percent agreement was assessed across 50 patients for each of the 114 queries developed from the IPSS database outcome questionnaire. Results: GPT demonstrated strong performance on several questions but showed variability overall. In its early iterations it was able to match human judgment occasionally with an accuracy score of 1.00 (n = 20, 17.5%), but it scored as low as 0.26 in some patients. Prompts were adjusted in four subsequent iterations to increase accuracy. In its fourth iteration, agreement was 93.6%, with a maximum agreement of 100% and minimum of 62%. Of 2400 individual items assessed, our model entered 2247 (93.6%) correctly and 153 (6.4%) incorrectly. Conclusions: Although our tailored generative model with domain-specific prompt engineering and ontological guidance shows promise for research applications, further refinement is needed to enhance its accuracy. It cannot enter data entirely independently, but it can be employed in tandem with human oversight contributing to a collaborative approach that reduces overall effort. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gpt; Ipss; Llm; Pediatric Stroke; Ps-gpt; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Cerebral Sinus Thrombosis; Cerebrovascular Accident; Child; Clinical Article; Female; Follow Up; Generative Pretrained Transformer; Hallucination; Human; Male; Pilot Study; Retrospective Study; Adolescent; Ischemic Stroke; Medical Research; Preschool Child; Therapy; Adolescent; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Male; Pilot Projects; Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial; Stroke","Article; artificial intelligence; cerebral sinus thrombosis; cerebrovascular accident; child; clinical article; female; follow up; generative pretrained transformer; hallucination; human; male; pilot study; retrospective study; adolescent; ischemic stroke; medical research; preschool child; therapy; Adolescent; Artificial Intelligence; Biomedical Research; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Ischemic Stroke; Male; Pilot Projects; Sinus Thrombosis, Intracranial; Stroke","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202057125"

We explore how one can use Large Languages Models (LLMs) in the design phase of systems to provide additional information about human-CPS interaction. Our approach proposes a preliminary ontology describing a hierarchy of types of behavior and relevant CPS components as input for prompt templates. It uses them to generate parts of human behavior descriptions, as well as a canned prompt with one variable about behavior. For demonstration, we take a smart building with a Home Energy System as the use case. An initial user evaluation shows that the behavior descriptions generated with standard and ontology-driven prompts complement each other and are useful when assisting humans. The discovered uncommon behaviors can be used to complete interaction scenarios that eventually result in a more robust CPS implementation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cyber-physical Systems; Digital Twin; Human Behavior; Large Language Models; User Scenario; Hierarchical Systems; Behaviour Descriptions; Cybe-physical Systems; Cyber-physical Systems; Human Behaviors; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Scoping; System Development; User Scenario; Ontology","Hierarchical systems; Behaviour descriptions; Cybe-physical systems; Cyber-physical systems; Human behaviors; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Scoping; System development; User scenario; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212228857"

However, harnessing the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain, particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Integration; Information Management; Knowledge Graph; Manufacturing Data Processing; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Query Languages; Smart Manufacturing; Translation (languages); Conceptual Schemas; Context-aware Prompting; Data-source; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Manufacturing Industries; Manufacturing Knowledge; Natural Language Queries; Power; Specific Information; Structured Query Language","Data integration; Information management; Knowledge graph; Manufacturing data processing; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Query languages; Smart manufacturing; Translation (languages); Conceptual schemas; Context-aware prompting; Data-source; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Manufacturing industries; Manufacturing knowledge; Natural language queries; Power; Specific information; Structured Query Language","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216677054"

A key step in this process is ontology matching, whereby the semantic models of KGs are aligned into a single cohesive semantic backbone. While finding simple pairwise equivalences between entities in two ontologies is well addressed by state-of-the-art algorithms, finding more complex mappings that can include multiple entities from different ontologies is far from solved, despite their importance in ensuring a deep and meaningful integration of KGs. We propose a novel complex ontology matching approach that explores geometric operations over the shared semantic space afforded by large language models, enabling the discovery of complex mappings that are missed by purely lexical approaches. We evaluate our approach on several biomedical ontologies using partial reference alignments and manual expert validation. Our approach improves on the performance of a purely lexical approach while also increasing the coverage of complex multi-ontology alignments by 20 to 80%, which translates to a 97% coverage of the source ontologies. Moreover, the manual evaluation of the mappings produced by LLM shows that it achieves a high level of precision.

This paper proposes a novel framework developed on the foundation of Llama 2, aiming to bridge the gap between natural language queries and executable code for geospatial analyses within the PyQGIS environment. It empowers non-expert users to leverage GIS technology without requiring deep knowledge of geospatial programming or tools. Through cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, including tailored entity recognition and ontology mapping, the framework accurately interprets user intents and translates them into specific GIS operations. Integration of geospatial ontologies enriches semantic comprehension, ensuring precise alignment between user descriptions, geospatial datasets, and geospatial analysis tasks. A code generation module empowered by Llama 2 converts these interpretations into PyQGIS scripts, enabling the execution of geospatial analysis and results visualization. Rigorous testing across a spectrum of geospatial analysis tasks, with incremental complexity, evaluates the framework and the performance of such a system, with LLM at its core. The proposed system demonstrates proficiency in handling various geometries, spatial relationships, and attribute queries, enabling accurate and efficient analysis of spatial datasets. Moreover, it offers robust error-handling mechanisms and supports tasks related to map styling, visualization, and data manipulation. However, it has some limitations, such as occasional struggles with ambiguous attribute names and aliases, which leads to potential inaccuracies in the filtering and retrieval of features.

We have developed an integrated and automated methodology that leverages a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to generate scenario-based ontologies and knowledge graphs from research articles and technical manuals. Our methodology utilizes the ChatGPT API as the primary reasoning engine, supplemented by Natural Language Processing modules and carefully engineered prompts. This combination enables an automated tool capable of generating ontologies independently. The ontologies generated through our AI-powered method are interoperable and can significantly facilitate the design of data models and software architecture, particularly in the development of urban decision support systems. What is the implication of the main finding? We compared ontologies generated by our LLM with those created by human experts through CQ-based qualitative evaluation, assessing the reliability and feasibility of our approach. The methodology has been successfully applied to intermodal freight data and simulations. This has allowed us to generate a scenario-based ontology and knowledge graph that enhances data discovery, integration, and management, thereby supporting network optimization and multiple criteria decision analysis. Our methodology is both generalizable and adaptive, enabling the automation of ontology generation to support the development of urban and environmental decision support systems across various disciplines. The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models into various optimization systems is on the rise. However, addressing complex urban and environmental management challenges often demands deep expertise in domain science and informatics. This expertise is essential for deriving data and simulation-driven insights that support informed decision-making. In this context, we investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to create knowledge representations for supporting operations research. By adopting ChatGPT-4 API as the reasoning core, we outline an applied workflow that encompasses natural language processing, Methontology-based prompt tuning, and Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), to automate the construction of scenario-based ontologies using existing research articles and technical manuals of urban datasets and simulations. From these ontologies, knowledge graphs can be derived using widely adopted formats and protocols, guiding various tasks towards data-informed decision support. The performance of our methodology is evaluated through a comparative analysis that contrasts our AI-generated ontology with the widely recognized pizza ontology, commonly used in tutorials for popular ontology software. We conclude with a real-world case study on optimizing the complex system of multi-modal freight transportation. Our approach advances urban decision support systems by enhancing data and metadata modeling, improving data integration and simulation coupling, and guiding the development of decision support strategies and essential software components. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Intermodal Freight Transportation; Large Language Models; Ontology; Urban Decision Support System","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207278547"

We evaluated the utility of FuseLinker in the graph-based drug repurposing task through detailed case studies. Methods: FuseLinker leverages fused pre-trained text embedding and domain knowledge embedding to enhance the graph neural network (GNN)-based link prediction model tailored for BKGs. This framework includes three parts: a) obtain text embeddings for BKGs using embedding-visible large language models (LLMs), b) learn the representations of medical ontology as domain knowledge information by employing the Poincaré graph embedding method, and c) fuse these embeddings and further learn the graph structure representations of BKGs by applying a GNN-based link prediction model. We evaluated FuseLinker against traditional knowledge graph embedding models and a conventional GNN-based link prediction model across four public BKG datasets. Additionally, we examined the impact of using different embedding-visible LLMs on FuseLinker's performance. Finally, we investigated FuseLinker's ability to generate medical hypotheses through two drug repurposing case studies for Sorafenib and Parkinson's disease. Results: By comparing FuseLinker with baseline models on four BKGs, our method demonstrates superior performance. The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) for KEGG50k, Hetionet, SuppKG and ADInt are 0.969 and 0.987, 0.548 and 0.903, 0.739 and 0.928, and 0.831 and 0.890, respectively. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates that FuseLinker is an effective novel link prediction framework that integrates multiple graph information and shows significant potential for practical applications in biomedical and clinical tasks.

Here, we present an integrated pipeline to construct a large-scale knowledge graph using large language models in an active learning setting. We apply our pipeline to the association of raw food, ingredients, and chemicals, a domain that lacks such knowledge resources. By using an iterative active learning approach of 4120 manually curated premise-hypothesis pairs as training data for ten consecutive cycles, the entailment model extracted 230,848 food-chemical composition relationships from 155,260 scientific papers, with 106,082 (46.0 %) of them never been reported in any published database. To augment the knowledge incorporated in the knowledge graph, we further incorporated information from 5 external databases and ontology sources. We then applied a link prediction model to identify putative food-chemical relationships that were not part of the constructed knowledge graph. Validation of the 443 hypotheses generated by the link prediction model resulted in 355 new food-chemical relationships, while results show that the model score correlates well (R2 = 0.70) with the probability of a novel finding.

As for any engineering development, its fundamental basis is the collection of requirements, which includes the elicitation of competency questions. Competency questions are defined through interacting with domain and application experts or by investigating existing datasets that may be used to populate the ontology i.e. its knowledge graph. The rise in popularity and accessibility of knowledge graphs provides an opportunity to support this phase with automatic tools. In this work, we explore the possibility of extracting competency questions from a knowledge graph. This reverses the traditional workflow in which knowledge graphs are built from ontologies, which in turn are engineered from competency questions. We describe in detail RevOnt, an approach that extracts and abstracts triples from a knowledge graph, generates questions based on triple verbalisations, and filters the resulting questions to yield a meaningful set of competency questions; the WDV dataset. This approach is implemented utilising the Wikidata knowledge graph as a use case, and contributes a set of core competency questions from 20 domains present in the WDV dataset. To evaluate RevOnt, we contribute a new dataset of manually-annotated high-quality competency questions, and compare the extracted competency questions by calculating their BLEU score against the human references. The results for the abstraction and question generation components of the approach show good to high quality. Meanwhile, the accuracy of the filtering component is above 86%, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art classifications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Competency Question Extraction; Knowledge Engineering; Knowledge Graph; Ontology Development; Abstracting; Data Mining; Extraction; Filtration; Ontology; And Filters; Automatic Tools; Competency Question Extraction; Engineering Development; High Quality; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Ontology Development; Ontology's; Work-flows; Knowledge Graph","Abstracting; Data mining; Extraction; Filtration; Ontology; And filters; Automatic tools; Competency question extraction; Engineering development; High quality; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Ontology development; Ontology's; Work-flows; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196541227"

DNA-binding TRPs such as zinc finger (ZNF) and transcription activator-like effector (TALE) play important roles in biology and biotechnology. In this study, we first conducted an extensive analysis of TRPs in public databases, and found that the enormous diversity of TRPs is largely unexplored. We then focused our efforts on identifying novel TRPs possessing DNA-binding capabilities. We established a protein language model for DNA-binding protein prediction (PLM-DBPPred), and predicted a large number of DNA-binding TRPs. A subset was then selected for experimental screening, leading to the identification of 11 novel DNA-binding TRPs, with six showing sequence specificity. Notably, members of the STAR (Short TALE-like Repeat proteins) family can be programmed to target specific 9 bp DNA sequences with high affinity. Leveraging this property, we generated artificial transcription factors using reprogrammed STAR proteins and achieved targeted activation of endogenous gene sets. Furthermore, the members of novel families such as MOON (Marine Organism-Originated DNA binding protein) and pTERF (prokaryotic mTERF-like protein) exhibit unique features and distinct DNA-binding characteristics, revealing interesting biological clues.

To study the intricacies of this metabolic interplay, we interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single-cell and multi-omics analyses and identified metabolically rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations with pro-tumorigenic properties. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their cholesterol accumulation, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features, and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. Engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris endows subsets of TAMs to acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Our work provides an in-depth understanding of the immune-metabolic interplay during glioblastoma progression, thereby laying a framework to unveil targetable metabolic vulnerabilities in glioblastoma. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cancer Immunity;

We develop ontologies OntoCrystal and OntoZeolite, enabling the representation and instantiation of crystalline zeolite information into a dynamic, interoperable knowledge graph called The World Avatar (TWA). In TWA, crystalline zeolite instances are semantically interconnected with chemical species that act as guests in these materials.

While in folkloristic and ethnographic studies this folklore genre was considered in the system of ideological values and etiquette behavior of the ethnic group, its linguistic corpus remains an untouched area. However, the basic basis of traditional good wishes is its language – a special verbal form of manifestation of the ethnic mentality, therefore, it should receive scientific coverage at all linguistic levels: semantic, grammatical, syntactic, pragmatic, etc. For a more in-depth consideration in order to identify the system of traditional values and worldview of the ethnos complex linguo-folkloristic, ethno-, linguocultural methods are used. The purpose of the article is to describe the methods, tasks and prospects for studying texts of good wishes. To achieve the goal, tasks related to the designation of texts of good wishes as an object of research are set and methods are proposed for a more in-depth comprehensive study of their plan of expression and plan of content. Thus, the study of complex problems of value categories of good wishes, pragmatic situations of their implementation and other forms of good wishes, reflected in the relationships of linguistic individuals, form an independent scientific direction. The relevance of the study is due to the lack of research into the language of the textual structure of well-wishes and the need to develop their linguistic-folkloristic paradigm, as well as the formation of a new conceptual apparatus. The novelty of the study lies in the fact that for the first time texts of good wishes are becoming the subject of special research on linguistic parameters correlated with pragmatic, communicative, folkloristic and other characteristics. The article identifies questions for potential research into texts of good wishes and describes methods for achieving these goals. This topic has good prospects for further research in interdisciplinary areas. In addition, the popularization of texts of traditional good wishes in the public environment, their spiritual and mental attitudes will make a certain contribution to the preservation and development of the Khakas language. First of all, the use of traditional expressions of good wishes in the modern discursive space allows us to expand the ontological function of the Khakas language. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Khakas Language; Language Models; Methods; National And Ideological Values; Priority Areas; Research Prospects; Study; Text Structure; Traditional Good Wishes","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213064157"

Through an in-depth structural analysis of this graph, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities along with their connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. We find that the graph has an inherently scale-free nature, shows a high level of connectedness, and can be used as a rich source for downstream graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties to reveal insights into unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. Using a large language embedding model we compute deep node representations and use combinatorial node similarity ranking to develop a path sampling strategy that allows us to link dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed detailed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven’s 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed an innovative hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky’s ‘Composition VII’ painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos and order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Because our method transcends established disciplinary boundaries through diverse data modalities (graphs, images, text, numerical data, etc), graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomaterials; Generative Ai; Graph Theory; Language Modeling; Materials Informatics; Materials Science; Natural Language Processing; Biological Materials; Biomaterials; Chaos Theory; Crystalline Materials; Generative Adversarial Networks; Ontology; Generative Artificial Intelligence; Knowledge Extraction; Language Model; Language Processing; Material Informatics; Material Science; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Path Sampling; Scientific Discovery; Knowledge Graph","Biological materials; Biomaterials; Chaos theory; Crystalline materials; Generative adversarial networks; Ontology; Generative artificial intelligence; Knowledge extraction; Language model; Language processing; Material Informatics; Material science; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Path sampling; Scientific discovery; Knowledge graph","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85206499137"

The conceptual foundation is further complemented with a spatial ontology and a custom gazetteer, allowing a formal and insightful semantic exploration of the massive unstructured corpus. The other contrasting side of the framework is the usage of LLMs for spatial relation extraction. We formulate prompts leveraging understanding of the LLMs of the intended task, curate a list of spatial relations representing the most recurring proximity or vicinity relations terms and extract semantic triples for the top five place names appearing in the corpus. We compare the extraction capabilities of three benchmark LLMs for a scholarly significant historical archive, representing their potential in a challenging and interdisciplinary research problem.

Concurrently, term clustering emerges as a crucial step in constructing these knowledge graphs, aiming to identify synonymous terms. Due to a lack of knowledge, previous contrastive learning models trained with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) synonyms struggle at clustering difficult terms and do not generalize well beyond UMLS terms. In this work, we leverage the world knowledge from large language models (LLMs) and propose Contrastive Learning for Representing Terms via Explanations (CoRTEx) to enhance term representation and significantly improves term clustering. Materials and Methods: The model training involves generating explanations for a cleaned subset of UMLS terms using ChatGPT. We employ contrastive learning, considering term and explanation embeddings simultaneously, and progressively introduce hard negative samples. Additionally, a ChatGPT-assisted BIRCH algorithm is designed for efficient clustering of a new ontology. Results: We established a clustering test set and a hard negative test set, where our model consistently achieves the highest F1 score. With CoRTEx embeddings and the modified BIRCH algorithm, we grouped 35 580 932 terms from the Biomedical Informatics Ontology System (BIOS) into 22 104 559 clusters with O(N) queries to ChatGPT. Case studies highlight the model's efficacy in handling challenging samples, aided by information from explanations. Conclusion: By aligning terms to their explanations, CoRTEx demonstrates superior accuracy over benchmark models and robustness beyond its training set, and it is suitable for clustering terms for large-scale biomedical ontologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive Learning; Knowledge Injection; Large Language Models; Term Clustering; Algorithm; Article; Biomedical Knowledge Graph; Case Study; Chatgpt; Contrastive Learning For Representing Terms Via Explanation; Language Model; Large Language Model; Medical Informatics; Sample; Scoring System; Unified Medical Language System","algorithm; Article; biomedical knowledge graph; case study; ChatGPT; contrastive learning for representing terms via explanation; language model; large language model; medical informatics; sample; scoring system; Unified Medical Language System","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201754632"

AlphaFold recently achieved promising performances when predicting protein tertiary structures, and the AlphaFold protein structure database (AlphaFold DB) is fast-expanding. Therefore, we aimed to develop a deep-learning tool that is specifically trained with AlphaFold models and predict GO terms from AlphaFold models. We developed an advanced learning architecture by combining geometric vector perceptron graph neural networks and variant transformer decoder layers for multi-label classification. PANDA-3D predicts gene ontology (GO) terms from the predicted structures of AlphaFold and the embeddings of amino acid sequences based on a large language model.

Methods: We developed an in-house template-based script to generate two corpora for fine-tuning. The first (NAME) contains standardized HPO names, sourced from the HPO vocabularies, along with their corresponding identifiers. The second (NAMEþSYN) includes HPO names and half of the concept’s synonyms as well as identifiers. Subsequently, we fine-tuned Llama 2 (Llama2-7B) for each sentence set and conducted an evaluation using a range of sentence prompts and various phenotype terms. Results: When the phenotype terms for normalization were included in the fine-tuning corpora, both models demonstrated nearly perfect performance, averaging over 99% accuracy. In comparison, ChatGPT-3.5 has only ∼20% accuracy in identifying HPO IDs for phenotype terms. When single-character typos were introduced in the phenotype terms, the accuracy of NAME and NAMEþSYN is 10.2% and 36.1%, respectively, but increases to 61.8% (NAMEþSYN) with additional typo-specific fine-tuning. For terms sourced from HPO vocabularies as unseen synonyms, the NAME model achieved 11.2% accuracy, while the NAMEþSYN model achieved 92.7% accuracy. Conclusion: Our fine-tuned models demonstrate ability to normalize phenotype terms unseen in the fine-tuning corpus, including misspellings, synonyms, terms from other ontologies, and laymen’s terms. Our approach provides a solution for the use of LLMs to identify named medical entities from clinical narratives, while successfully normalizing them to standard concepts in a controlled vocabulary. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concept Normalization; Fine-tuning; Hpo; Large Language Model; Llama 2; Article; Chatgpt; Large Language Model; Rare Disease; Biological Ontology; Controlled Vocabulary; Human; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Rare Diseases; Vocabulary, Controlled","Article; ChatGPT; large language model; rare disease; biological ontology; controlled vocabulary; human; natural language processing; phenotype; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Rare Diseases; Vocabulary, Controlled","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200384913"

The survival tactics of both pathogens and hosts depend on intricate interactions between host plants and pathogenic microbes. Iron-binding proteins (IBPs) and copper-binding proteins (CBPs) play a crucial role in these interactions by participating in enzyme reactions, virulence, metabolism, and transport processes. We employed high-throughput computational tools at the sequence and structural levels to investigate the IBPs and CBPs of F. oxysporum. A total of 124 IBPs and 37 CBPs were identified in the proteome of Fusarium. The ranking of amino acids based on their affinity for binding with iron is Glu > His> Asp > Asn > Cys, and for copper is His > Asp > Cys respectively. The functional annotation, determination of subcellular localization, and Gene Ontology analysis of these putative IBPs and CBPs have unveiled their potential involvement in a diverse array of cellular and biological processes. Three iron-binding glycosyl hydrolase family proteins, along with four CBPs with carbohydrate-binding domains, have been identified as potential effector candidates. These proteins are distinct from the host Solanum lycopersicum proteome. Moreover, they are known to be located extracellularly and function as enzymes that degrade the host cell wall during pathogen–host interactions. The insights gained from this report on the role of metal ions in plant–pathogen interactions can help develop a better understanding of their fundamental biology and control vascular wilt disease in tomato plants. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinformatics; Fusarium Oxysporum; Metalloproteome; Plant–pathogen Interaction; Vascular Wilt; Catalase; Copper; Cytochrome P450; Glutathione; Glycine; Glycosidase; Hemicellulose; Iron; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lactate Dehydrogenase A; Lignin; Nitrate Reductase; Nitric Oxide; Pectin; Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Dehydrogenase; Succinate Dehydrogenase; Xanthine Dehydrogenase; Carrier Protein; Carrier Proteins; Copper; Copper-binding Protein; Fungal Proteins; Iron; Iron-binding Proteins; Proteome; Cytoscape V3.9.0 Software; Catalase; Copper; Cytochrome P450; Glutathione; Glycine; Glycosidase; Hemicellulose; Iron; Lactate Dehydrogenase; Lignin; Metalloprotein; Mycotoxin; Nitrate Reductase; Nitric Oxide; Pectin; Proteome; Reactive Oxygen Metabolite; Reduced Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Dehydrogenase; Succinate Dehydrogenase; Xanthine Dehydrogenase; Carrier Protein; Copper-binding Protein; Fungal Protein; Iron Binding Protein; Protein Binding; Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Synthesis; Antioxidant Activity; Article; Aspergillus Fumigatus; Aspergillus Niger; Binding Affinity; Bioinformatics; Cellular Distribution; Fungal Viability; Fungal Virulence; Fusarium Oxysporum; Gene Ontology; Glycolysis; Host Pathogen Interaction; Iron Homeostasis; Machine Learning; Morphogenesis; Nonhuman; Oxidative Stress; Phytopathogen; Protein Interaction; Protein Language Model; Protein Synthesis; Proteomics; Rna Isolation; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Sequence Alignment; Support Vector Machine; Tomato; Chemistry; Fusarium; Genetics; Metabolism; Microbiology; Plant Disease; Carrier Proteins; Copper; Fungal Proteins; Iron; Iron-binding Proteins; Plant Diseases; Protein Binding; Proteome; Solanum Lycopersicum","catalase; copper; cytochrome P450; glutathione; glycine; glycosidase; hemicellulose; iron; lactate dehydrogenase; lignin; metalloprotein; mycotoxin; nitrate reductase; nitric oxide; pectin; proteome; reactive oxygen metabolite; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide dehydrogenase; succinate dehydrogenase; xanthine dehydrogenase; carrier protein; copper-binding protein; fungal protein; iron binding protein; protein binding; amino acid sequence; amino acid synthesis; antioxidant activity; Article; Aspergillus fumigatus; Aspergillus niger; binding affinity; bioinformatics; cellular distribution; fungal viability; fungal virulence; Fusarium oxysporum; gene ontology; glycolysis; host pathogen interaction; iron homeostasis; machine learning; morphogenesis; nonhuman; oxidative stress; phytopathogen; protein interaction; protein language model; protein synthesis; proteomics; RNA isolation; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence alignment; support vector machine; tomato; chemistry; Fusarium; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; plant disease; Carrier Proteins; Copper; Fungal Proteins; Iron; Iron-Binding Proteins; Plant Diseases; Protein Binding; Proteome; Solanum lycopersicum","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191296052"

How to mine structured knowledge from the text data remains a crucial research question. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shed light on the text mining field with their superior text understanding and instruction-following ability. There are typically two ways of utilizing LLMs: fine-tune the LLMs with human-annotated training data, which is labor intensive and hard to scale; prompt the LLMs in a zero-shot or few-shot way, which cannot take advantage of the useful information in the massive text data. Therefore, it remains a challenge on automated mining of structured knowledge from massive text data in the era of large language models. In this tutorial, we cover the recent advancements in mining structured knowledge using language models with very weak supervision. We will introduce the following topics in this tutorial: (1) introduction to large language models, which serves as the foundation for recent text mining tasks, (2) ontology construction, which automatically enriches an ontology from a massive corpus, (3) weakly-supervised text classification in flat and hierarchical label space, (4) weakly-supervised information extraction, which extracts entity and relation structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Text Mining; Weak Supervision; Self-supervised Learning; Zero-shot Learning; Automated Mining; Language Model; Large Language Model; News Articles; Scientific Papers; Structured Knowledge; Text Data; Text-mining; Unstructured Texts; Weak Supervision; Ontology","Self-supervised learning; Zero-shot learning; Automated mining; Language model; Large language model; News articles; Scientific papers; Structured knowledge; Text data; Text-mining; Unstructured texts; Weak supervision; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203709209"

FET has been studied extensively in natural language processing and typically relies on human-annotated corpora for training, which is costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies explore the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as a knowledge base to generate rich and context-aware weak supervision for FET. However, a PLM still requires direction and guidance to serve as a knowledge base as they often generate a mixture of rough and fine-grained types, or tokens unsuitable for typing. In this study, we vision that an ontology provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, which will help select the best results generated by multiple PLM models and head words. Specifically, we propose a novel annotation-free, ontology-guided FET method, OntoType, which follows a type ontological structure, from coarse to fine, ensembles multiple PLM prompting results to generate a set of type candidates, and refines its type resolution, under the local context with a natural language inference model. Our experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and NYT datasets using their associated ontological structures demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot fine-grained entity typing methods as well as a typical LLM method, ChatGPT.

Conventional methods for FET require extensive human annotation, which is time-consuming and costly given the massive scale of data. Recent studies have been developing weakly supervised or zero-shot approaches. We study the setting of zero-shot FET where only an ontology is provided. However, most existing ontology structures lack rich supporting information and even contain ambiguous relations, making them ineffective in guiding FET. Recently developed language models, though promising in various few-shot and zero-shot NLP tasks, may face challenges in zero-shot FET due to their lack of interaction with task-specific ontology. In this study, we propose øurs, where we (1) enrich each node in the ontology structure with two categories of extra information:instance information for training sample augmentation andtopic information to relate types with contexts, and (2) develop a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that exploits the enriched information by training an entailment model with contrasting topics and instance-based augmented training samples. Our experiments show that øurs achieves high-quality fine-grained entity typing without human annotation, outperforming existing zero-shot methods by a large margin and rivaling supervised methods. øurs also enjoys strong transferability to unseen and finer-grained types.

In this article, we utilize systematic methods to improve XLORE's data quality and present its latest version, XLORE 3, which enables the effective integration and management of heterogeneous knowledge from diverse resources. Compared with previous versions, XLORE 3 has three major advantages: (1) We design a comprehensive and reasonable schema, namely XLORE ontology, which can effectively organize and manage entities from various resources. (2) We merge equivalent entities in different languages to facilitate knowledge sharing. We provide a large-scale entity linking system to establish the associations between unstructured text and structured KG. (3) We design a multi-strategy knowledge completion framework, which leverages pre-trained language models and vast amounts of unstructured text to discover missing and new facts. The resulting KG contains 446 concepts, 2,608 properties, 66 million entities, and more than 2 billion facts.

In this study, we propose a multimode descriptor design method for materials prediction and analysis, leveraging the advantages of the natural language processing literature model and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with the assistance of the genetic algorithm (GA). A case study on prediction of aqueous photocurrents of multisolvent engineered halide perovskite CH<inf>3</inf>NH<inf>3</inf>PbI<inf>3</inf> is performed, and the following-up validation experiments are carried out to demonstrate the improved accuracy of the multimode descriptors (an unprecedented experimental validation accuracy of 87.5% via the GA is achieved) for predicting aqueous photocurrents of perovskite materials (c.f. only 50% experimental accuracy for other common machine learning models). The improved experimental accuracy of the descriptors is attributed to the successful deployment of a language model incorporating concise scientific information from >1 million articles into molecular descriptors in combination with DFT calculations. The subsequent machine learning analysis suggests the importance of cation···π and crystallization in molecule-modified halide perovskite materials representing ontological and conceptual understanding. Importantly, the genetic process affords an accurate “white-box” model to describe the perovskite stability (accuracy = 90.2% for the test data set and 92.3% for the train data set) with the mathematical equation Formula Presented, where F<inf>1</inf> ∼ F<inf>5</inf> atomic-level structural and chemical details such as cation···π interactions and highest occupied molecular orbital levels.

With the increasing reliance on Online Job Portals, analyzing online job postings has become an essential tool for capturing real-time labor-market trends. This paper presents a comprehensive methodology for processing online job postings to generate labor-market intelligence. The proposed methodology encompasses data source selection, data extraction, cleansing, normalization, and deduplication procedures. The final step involves information extraction based on employer industry, occupation, workplace, skills, and required experience. We address the key challenges that emerge at each step and discuss how they can be resolved. Our methodology is applied to two use cases: the first focuses on the analysis of the Greek labor market in the tourism industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealing shifts in job demands, skill requirements, and employment types. In the second use case, a data-driven ontology is employed to extract skills from job postings using machine learning. The findings highlight that the proposed methodology, utilizing NLP and machine-learning techniques instead of LLMs, can be applied to different labor market-analysis use cases and offer valuable insights for businesses, job seekers, and policymakers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data-driven Ontology; Labor Information Extraction; Labor-market Analysis; Machine Learning; Nlp; Online Job Postings; Job Analysis; Leisure Industry; Ontology; Data Driven; Data-driven Ontology; Job Postings; Labor Information Extraction; Labor-market Analyze; Labour Market; Machine-learning; Market Analysis; Online Job Posting; Ontology's; Tourism Industry","Job analysis; Leisure industry; Ontology; Data driven; Data-driven ontology; Job postings; Labor information extraction; Labor-market analyze; Labour market; Machine-learning; Market analysis; Online job posting; Ontology's; Tourism industry","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202350400"

Pretrained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated very good performance on a variety of sentiment analysis tasks in different domains. However, it is known that sentiment analysis is a very domain-dependent NLP task that requires knowledge of the domain ontology, and this is particularly the case with the financial domain, which uses its own unique vocabulary. Recent developments in NLP and deep learning including LLMs have made it possible to generate actionable financial sentiments using multiple sources including financial news, company fundamentals, technical indicators, as well social media microblogs posted on platforms such as StockTwits and X (formerly Twitter). We developed a financial social media sentiment analyzer (FinSoSent), which is a domain-specific large language model for the financial domain that was pretrained on financial news articles and fine-tuned and tested using several financial social media corpora. We conducted a large number of experiments using different learning rates, epochs, and batch sizes to yield the best performing model. Our model outperforms current state-of-the-art FSA models based on over 860 experiments, demonstrating the efficacy and effectiveness of FinSoSent. We also conducted experiments using ensemble models comprising FinSoSent and the other current state-of-the-art FSA models used in this research, and a slight performance improvement was obtained based on majority voting. Based on the results obtained across all models in these experiments, the significance of this study is that it highlights the fact that, despite the recent advances of LLMs, sentiment analysis even in domain-specific contexts remains a difficult research problem. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Financial Markets; Llm; Sentiment Analysis; Social Media; Stocktwits; Twitter/x; Decentralized Finance; Financial Markets; Market Research; Problem Oriented Languages; Sentiment Analysis; Bert; Financial Domains; Language Model; Large Language Model; Micro-blog; Performance; Social Media; Stocktwit; Twitter/x; Tweets","Decentralized finance; Financial markets; Market Research; Problem oriented languages; Sentiment analysis; BERT; Financial domains; Language model; Large language model; Micro-blog; Performance; Social media; Stocktwit; Twitter/X; Tweets","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85202346804"

Through comparison, protein sequence embeddings allow for interpretable and accurate annotation of proteins, as well as for downstream tasks such as clustering for unsupervised discovery of protein families. However, it is unclear whether embeddings can be deliberately designed to improve their use in these downstream tasks. Results: We find that for functional annotation of proteins, as represented by Gene Ontology (GO) terms, direct fine-tuning of language models on a simple classification loss has an immediate positive impact on protein embedding quality. Fine-tuned embeddings show stronger performance as representations for K-nearest neighbor classifiers, reaching stronger performance for GO annotation than even directly comparable fine-tuned classifiers, while maintaining interpretability through protein similarity comparisons. They also maintain their quality in related tasks, such as rediscovering protein families with clustering. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Classifier; Gene Ontology; Human; K Nearest Neighbor; Language Model; Algorithm; Bioinformatics; Chemistry; Cluster Analysis; Molecular Genetics; Procedures; Protein Database; Protein; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins","amino acid sequence; article; classifier; gene ontology; human; k nearest neighbor; language model; algorithm; bioinformatics; chemistry; cluster analysis; molecular genetics; procedures; protein database; protein; Algorithms; Cluster Analysis; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Proteins","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200763463"

This crucial process predominantly takes place during task planning, prior to the actual performance of service tasks. Therefore, it is vital that the robot is capable of formulating object-specific action sequences through task planning. In this letter, we propose the Fine-Grained Task Planning (FGTP) framework, an innovative method that combines object ontology knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create detailed action sequences. The FGTP framework is uniquely designed to process both text descriptions of service tasks and images of relevant objects, enabling a thorough comprehension of object attributes essential for task execution. Moreover, we have developed a set of rules based on these attributes to assist in the robot's decision-making process. In scenarios where service tasks fail because the object is in an unsuitable state, our framework deploys a logic-based reasoning method, concentrating on object attributes to identify suitable substitutes. This process leverages a pre-established semantic map to locate these alternatives, thus enabling a transition back to standard task planning. Our evaluations, conducted in both the VirtualHome simulation environment and with the TIAGo real robot, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This confirms our framework's capability to generate practical and implementable plans for various service tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Service Robotics; Task Planning; Computational Linguistics; Decision Making; Job Analysis; Ontology; Robot Programming; Semantics; Fine Grained; Language Model; Object Ontology; Objects Recognition; Ontology's; Robot Kinematics; Service Robotics; Service Robots; Task Analysis; Task Planning; Object Recognition","Computational linguistics; Decision making; Job analysis; Ontology; Robot programming; Semantics; Fine grained; Language model; Object ontology; Objects recognition; Ontology's; Robot kinematics; Service robotics; Service robots; Task analysis; Task planning; Object recognition","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196082646"

By coupling protein embeddings from language models with RNA expression, SATURN integrates datasets profiled from different species regardless of their genomic similarity. SATURN can detect functionally related genes coexpressed across species, redefining differential expression for cross-species analysis. Applying SATURN to three species whole-organism atlases and frog and zebrafish embryogenesis datasets, we show that SATURN can effectively transfer annotations across species, even when they are evolutionarily remote.

OCEs typically leverage data from different stages of the software development lifecycle [SDLC] (e.g., codes, configuration, monitor data, service properties, service dependencies, trouble-shooting documents, etc.) to generate insights for detection, root cause analysis and mitigation of incidents. Recent advancements in large language models [LLMs] (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini) have created opportunities to automatically generate contextual recommendations for the OCEs, assisting them in quickly identifying and mitigating critical issues. However, existing research typically takes a silo-ed view of solving a certain task in incident management by leveraging data from a single stage of the SDLC. In this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting additional contextual data from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance of two critically important and practically challenging tasks: (1) automatically generating root cause recommendations for dependency failure related incidents, and (2) identifying the ontology of service monitors used for automatically detecting incidents. By leveraging a dataset of 353 incidents and 260 monitors from Microsoft, we demonstrate that augmenting contextual information from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance over state-of-the-art methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cloud Services; Large Language Models; Monitor Management; Reliability; Root-cause Analysis; Computational Linguistics; Distributed Database Systems; Life Cycle; Reliability Analysis; Software Design; Cloud Services; Code Configuration; Different Stages; Incident Management; Language Model; Large Language Model; Monitor Management; Performance; Root Cause Analysis; Software Development Life-cycle; Web Services","Computational linguistics; Distributed database systems; Life cycle; Reliability analysis; Software design; Cloud services; Code configuration; Different stages; Incident Management; Language model; Large language model; Monitor management; Performance; Root cause analysis; Software development life-cycle; Web services","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198654519"

However, generating and linking KCs to assessment items requires significant effort and domain-specific knowledge. To streamline this process for higher-education courses, we employed GPT-4 to generate KCs for multiple-choice questions (MCQs) in Chemistry and E-Learning. We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts. We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy accurately matched KCs for 56% of Chemistry and 35% of E-Learning MCQs, with even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically significant across both domains.

In our prior studies, we have developed a series of methods including GraphPPIS, GraphSite, LMetalSite and SPROF-GO for protein function annotations at residue or protein level. To further enhance their applicability and performance, we now present GPSFun, a versatile web server for Geometry-aware Protein Sequence Function annotations, which equips our previous tools with language models and geometric deep learning. Specifically, GPSFun employs large language models to efficiently predict 3D conformations of the input protein sequences and extract informative sequence embeddings. Subsequently, geometric graph neural networks are utilized to capture the sequence and structure patterns in the protein graphs, facilitating various downstream predictions including protein-ligand binding sites, gene ontologies, subcellular locations and protein solubility. Notably, GPSFun achieves superior performance to state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks without requiring multiple sequence alignments or experimental protein structures.

Traditional manual compliance checking methods are inefficient and error-prone, failing to meet modern engineering demands. Natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning methods have improved efficiency and accuracy in rule interpretation and compliance checking. However, these methods still require extensive manual feature engineering, large, annotated datasets, and significant computational resources. Large language models (LLMs) provide robust language understanding with minimal labeled data due to their pre-training and few-shot learning capabilities. However, their application in the AEC field is still limited by the need for fine-tuning for specific tasks, handling complex texts with nested clauses and conditional statements. This study introduces an innovative automated compliance checking framework that integrates LLM, deep learning models, and ontology knowledge models. The use of LLM is motivated by its few-shot learning capability, which significantly reduces the need for large, annotated datasets required by previous methods. Deep learning is employed to preliminarily classify regulatory texts, which further enhances the accuracy of structured information extraction by the LLM compared to directly feeding raw data into the LLM. This novel combination of deep learning and LLM significantly enhances the efficiency and accuracy of compliance checks by automating the processing of regulatory texts and reducing manual intervention. This approach is crucial for architects, engineers, project managers, and regulators, providing a scalable and adaptable solution for automated compliance in the construction industry with broad application prospects. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated Compliance Check; Bim; Deep Learning; Design Regulations; Large Language Models (llms); Ontology Knowledge Models; Architectural Design; Automation; Classification (of Information); Compliance Control; Computational Linguistics; Construction Industry; Deep Learning; Efficiency; Information Theory; Large Datasets; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Personnel Training; Regulatory Compliance; Structural Design; Automated Compliance Check; Building Information Modelling; Compliance Checks; Design Regulation; Knowledge Model; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology Knowledge Model; Ontology's; Modeling Languages","Architectural design; Automation; Classification (of information); Compliance control; Computational linguistics; Construction industry; Deep learning; Efficiency; Information theory; Large datasets; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Personnel training; Regulatory compliance; Structural design; Automated compliance check; Building Information Modelling; Compliance checks; Design regulation; Knowledge model; Language model; Large language model; Ontology knowledge model; Ontology's; Modeling languages","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199602988"

While the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for natural language understanding has led to several LLM-based solutions, we argue that their intrinsic resource-intensive nature is not suitable for realistic management of the phenotype CR lifecycle. Consequently, we propose to go back to the basics and adopt a dictionary-based approach that enables both an immediate refresh of the ontological concepts as well as efficient re-analysis of past data. Results: We developed a dictionary-based approach using a pre-built large collection of clusters of morphologically equivalent tokens-to address lexical variability and a more effective CR step by reducing the entity boundary detection strictly to candidates consisting of tokens belonging to ontology concepts.

This environment aims to integrate advanced information and communication technologies to support both traditional in-person therapy and digital health solutions. Background: Telerehabilitation is emerging as a core component of modern healthcare, especially within the PM&R field. By applying digital health technologies, telerehabilitation provides continuous, comprehensive support for patient rehabilitation, bridging the gap between traditional therapy, and remote healthcare delivery. This study focuses on the design, and implementation of a hybrid HCET system tailored for the PM&R domain. Methods: The study involved the development of a comprehensive architectural and structural organization for the HCET, including a three-layer model (infrastructure, platform, service layers). Core components of the HCET were designed and implemented, such as the Hospital Information System (HIS) for PM&R, the MedRehabBot system, and the MedLocalGPT project. These components were integrated using advanced technologies like large language models (LLMs), word embeddings, and ontology-related approaches, along with APIs for enhanced functionality and interaction. Findings: The HCET system was successfully implemented and is operational, providing a robust platform for telerehabilitation. Key features include the MVP of the HIS for PM&R, supporting patient profile management, and rehabilitation goal tracking; the MedRehabBot and WhiteBookBot systems; and the MedLocalGPT project, which offers sophisticated querying capabilities, and access to extensive domain-specific knowledge. The system supports both Ukrainian and English languages, ensuring broad accessibility and usability. Interpretation: The practical implementation, and operation of the HCET system demonstrate its potential to transform telerehabilitation within the PM&R domain. By integrating advanced technologies, and providing comprehensive digital health solutions, the HCET enhances patient care, supports ongoing rehabilitation, and facilitates advanced research.

The main paradigm in automatically generating proper Knowledge Graphs relies on predefined schemas or ontologies. Such schemas are typically manually constructed, requiring an intensive human effort, and are often sensitive to information loss due to negligence, incomplete analysis, or human subjectivity or inclination. Limiting human bias and the resulting information loss in creating proper Knowledge Graphs is paramount, particularly for user modeling in various sectors, such as education or healthcare. To this end, we propose a novel approach to automatically generating a proper entity schema. The devised methodology combines the language understanding capabilities of LLM with classical machine learning methods such as clustering to properly build an entity schema from a set of documents. This solution eliminates the need for human intervention and fosters a more efficient and comprehensive knowledge representation. The assessment of our proposal concerns adopting a state-of-the-art entity extraction model (UniNER) to estimate the relevance of the extracted entities based on the generated schema. Results confirm the potential of our approach, as we observed a negligible difference between the topic similarity score obtained with the ground truth and with the automatically generated schema (less than 1% on average on three different datasets). Such an outcome confirms that the proposed approach may be valuable in automatically creating an entity schema from a set of documents. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology Learning; Learning Systems; Ontology; Semantics; User Profile; Zero-shot Learning; 'current; Complex Information; Digital Transformation; Information Loss; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology Learning; Schema Inference; Knowledge Graph","Learning systems; Ontology; Semantics; User profile; Zero-shot learning; 'current; Complex information; Digital transformation; Information loss; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Ontology learning; Schema inference; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85198932122"

This pleiotropic nature of gene function is limited by ontologies, which annotate gene functions without considering biological contexts. We contend that the gene function problem in genetics may be informed by recent technological leaps in natural language processing, in which representations of word semantics can be automatically learned from diverse language contexts. In contrast to efforts to model semantics as “is-a” relationships in the 1990s, modern distributional semantics represents words as vectors in a learned semantic space and fuels current advances in transformer-based models such as large language models and generative pre-trained transformers.

The main purpose of this study is to follow the recommendations pertaining to the utilisation of LOV as a basis for experimentation in order to examine how information within the Cultural Heritage (CH) domain can be improved in terms of reusability and interoperability. The present lack of cross-domain knowledge transfer forms the motivation behind this study, with the aim of facilitating the transition from conventional, domain-specific knowledge representation to reusable and semantically interoperable information. The methodology of this study involves the manual semantic mapping of elements from 12 vocabularies in the LOV registry, reinforced by a small-scale experiment using contemporary large language models (LLMs), particularly GPT, for a preliminary assessment of the mapping process. The findings revealed several key aspects to consider regarding the alignment of semantically adjacent vocabulary elements in the CH domain and beyond, emphasising the potential unveiled by linking domain-focused schemata to standardised, established ones while preserving the conceptual hierarchies inherent to each individual knowledge domain. The contribution of this research pertains to the vision of linking data across different domains by initiating the alignment among representation schemata in CH, with the ultimate aim to expand beyond the boundaries of the in-word knowledge domain, while employing combinatory methodological approaches of technological means and human expertise to facilitate this process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Interoperability; Knowledge Management; Knowledge Representation; Linked Data; Mapping; Natural Language Processing Systems; Reusability; Semantics; Cross-domain; Cultural Heritages; Domain Knowledge; Domain Specific; Information Representation; Knowledge Domains; Linked Data Principles; Ontology's; Semantics Mappings; Target Domain; Domain Knowledge","Computational linguistics; Interoperability; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Linked data; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Reusability; Semantics; Cross-domain; Cultural heritages; Domain knowledge; Domain specific; Information representation; Knowledge domains; Linked Data principles; Ontology's; Semantics mappings; Target domain; Domain Knowledge","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195318383"

This study aims to evaluate the accuracy of LLM-powered question answering systems in the context of enterprise questions and SQL databases, while also exploring the role of knowledge graphs in improving accuracy. To achieve this, we introduce a benchmark comprising an enterprise SQL schema in the insurance domain, a range of enterprise queries encompassing reporting to metrics, and a contextual layer incorporating an ontology and mappings that define a knowledge graph. Our primary finding reveals that question answering using GPT-4, with zero-shot prompts directly on SQL databases, achieves an accuracy of 16%.

This paper focuses on creativity, defined as consensual agreement among domain experts. It presents an inductive analysis of seven semi-structured interviews with professional playwrights who engaged in a longitudinal project with the aim of writing a theatre script using commercial systems. Overall, participants regarded LLMs as unsuitable for playwrighting. However, they enjoyed the experience and identified utility for editorial tasks and brainstorming. A significant obstacle was associated with the politics embedded in LLMs. Not only did these systems avoid a language that could offend sensibilities, but they also refused to engage in taboos and conflicts, which are the core of dramaturgy. Other system features (speed, exploitation, and unpredictability) were sometimes considered conducive and sometimes detrimental to creativity. Participants experienced difficulties and tried to build common ground by trial and error. Often, this strategy evolved into role play: the playwright instructed the LLM to enact characters. The interaction provided hints of inspiration and fostered suspension of disbelief and ontological reflection. However, it often led to technology rejection. Comparing and contrasting our insights with related work, we conclude by opening new directions for research at the boundaries of HCI and AI. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Creative Ai; Creativity; Roleplay; Suspension Of Disbelief; Theatre; Unpredictability; Creative Ai; Creatives; Creativity; Domain Experts; Feature Interactions; Interaction Strategy; Language Model; Role-plays; Suspension Of Disbelief; Unpredictability; Computational Linguistics","Creative AI; Creatives; Creativity; Domain experts; Feature interactions; Interaction strategy; Language model; Role-plays; Suspension of disbelief; Unpredictability; Computational linguistics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195379233"

Light influences the circadian rhythm. This study aims to explore the ALAN-induced ovarian transcriptome of zebrafish for desynchronization of life processes. Methods: Four experimental conditions were set up for female zebrafish: one normal 12-hour light and 12-hour dark (LD) cycle, and three continuous exposures to ALAN for one week (LLW), one month (LLM), and one year (LLY). The whole transcriptome data analysis of the ALAN-exposed samples was then compared with the normal sample using RNA-Seq, followed by exploratory analyses. Results: The analysis revealed two different patterns of expression of genes where LLW and LLM differ with LLY samples in comparison to LD. Compared to LD, downregulation of the predicted hub genes was observed in all treatments; ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation pathways were enriched. LLY vs. LD contrast depicts the enrichment of three more pathways-RNA polymerase, adhesion junction, and signaling. The gene ontology (GO) enrichment portrays more prevalent biological processes in LLW vs. LD and LLM vs. LD than in LLY vs. LD. Contrast-wise disease annotation represents neoplasms as the most prevalent; disease enrichment denotes the major class of neoplasm, carcinoma, coupled with intellectual disability, global developmental delay, and seizures. Conclusion: Our study displayed desynchronization of various genes and pathways leading to the initiation of diseases, for the first time in zebrafish. Even though, this data shows that ALAN is a serious threat, further research is needed to determine the intensity and the duration of ALAN which might cause potential repercussions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Light At Night; Clock; Desynchronization; Disease; Ovary; Rnaseq","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197454469"

Ontologies play a critical role in such processes by providing well-consolidated support to link and semantically integrate datasets via interoperability. This paper approaches data integration from an application perspective by looking at ontology matching techniques. As the manual matching of different sources of information becomes unrealistic once the system scales up, the automation of the matching process becomes a compelling need. Therefore, we have conducted experiments on actual non-semantically enriched relational data with the support of existing tools (pre-LLM technology) for automatic ontology matching from the scientific community. Even considering a relatively simple case study—i.e., the spatio–temporal alignment of macro indicators—outcomes clearly show significant uncertainty resulting from errors and inaccuracies along the automated matching process. More concretely, this paper aims to test on real-world data a bottom-up knowledge-building approach, discuss the lessons learned from the experimental results of the case study, and draw conclusions about uncertainty and uncertainty management in an automated ontology matching process. While the most common evaluation metrics clearly demonstrate the unreliability of fully automated matching solutions, properly designed semi-supervised approaches seem to be mature for more generalized application. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Integration; Ontology Matching; Uncertainty","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195951776"

Linking them to genetic variability is essential for shorter and more efficient wheat breeding programs. A growing number of plant molecular information networks provide interlinked interoperable data to support the discovery of gene-phenotype interactions. A large body of scientific literature and observational data obtained in-field and under controlled conditions document wheat breeding experiments. The cross-referencing of this complementary information is essential. Text from databases and scientific publications has been identified early on as a relevant source of information. However, the wide variety of terms used to refer to traits and phenotype values makes it difficult to find and cross-reference the textual information, e.g. simple dictionary lookup methods miss relevant terms. Corpora with manually annotated examples are thus needed to evaluate and train textual information extraction methods. While several corpora contain annotations of human and animal phenotypes, no corpus is available for plant traits. This hinders the evaluation of text mining-based crop knowledge graphs (e.g. AgroLD, KnetMiner, WheatIS-FAIDARE) and limits the ability to train machine learning methods and improve the quality of information. The Triticum aestivum trait Corpus is a new gold standard for traits and phenotypes of wheat. It consists of 528 PubMed references that are fully annotated by trait, phenotype, and species. We address the interoperability challenge of crossing sparse assay data and publications by using the Wheat Trait and Phenotype Ontology to normalize trait mentions and the species taxonomy of the National Center for Biotechnology Information to normalize species. The paper describes the construction of the corpus. A study of the performance of state-of-the-art language models for both named entity recognition and linking tasks trained on the corpus shows that it is suitable for training and evaluation. This corpus is currently the most comprehensive manually annotated corpus for natural language processing studies on crop phenotype information from the literature. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Book; Breeding; Data Base; Genetic Variability; Human; Language Model; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Nonhuman; Phenotype; Taxonomy; Triticum Aestivum; Wheat; Data Mining; Genetics; Plant Breeding; Procedures; Data Mining; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Triticum","article; book; breeding; data base; genetic variability; human; language model; machine learning; natural language processing; nonhuman; phenotype; taxonomy; Triticum aestivum; wheat; data mining; genetics; plant breeding; procedures; Data Mining; Phenotype; Plant Breeding; Triticum","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195849965"

This focus on the provenance of AI-generated conclusions underscores the need for decision-making processes that are not only transparent but also readily interpretable by humans, to built trust of both users and stakeholders. In this context, the integration of state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) with logic-oriented Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) and the broader scope of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) methodologies is currently at the cutting edge of industrial and academic research across numerous data-intensive areas. Indeed, such a synergy is paramount as LLMs bring a layer of adaptability and human-centric understanding that complements the structured insights of EKGs. Conversely, the central role of ontological reasoning is to capture the domain knowledge, accurately handling complex tasks over a given realm of interest, and to infuse the process with transparency and a clear provenance-based explanation of the conclusions drawn, addressing the fundamental challenge of LLMs' inherent opacity and fostering trust and accountability in AI applications. In this paper, we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework that leverages the underpinnings of provenance in ontological reasoning to enhance state-of-the-art LLMs with domain awareness and explainability, enabling them to act as natural language interfaces to EKGs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graphs; Language Models; Ontological Reasoning; Provenance; Computational Linguistics; Decision Making; Industrial Research; Interface States; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing Systems; Academic Research; Cutting Edges; Decision-making Process; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge Representation And Reasoning; Language Model; Model Reasonings; Ontological Reasoning; Provenance; State Of The Art; Transparency","Computational linguistics; Decision making; Industrial research; Interface states; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Academic research; Cutting edges; Decision-making process; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Language model; Model reasonings; Ontological reasoning; Provenance; State of the art; Transparency","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195697101"

The Open Targets Platform (OT) integrates biomedical, genetic, and biochemical datasets to empower disease ontologies, classifications, and potential gene targets. Nevertheless, many disease annotations are incomplete, requiring laborious expert medical input. This challenge is especially pronounced for rare and orphan diseases, where resources are scarce. Methods: We present a machine learning approach to identifying diseases with potential subtypes, using the approximately 23,000 diseases documented in OT. We derive novel features for predicting diseases with subtypes using direct evidence. Machine learning models were applied to analyze feature importance and evaluate predictive performance for discovering both known and novel disease subtypes. Results: Our model achieves a high (89.4%) ROC AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) in identifying known disease subtypes. We integrated pre-trained deep-learning language models and showed their benefits. Moreover, we identify 515 disease candidates predicted to possess previously unannotated subtypes. Conclusions: Our models can partition diseases into distinct subtypes.

Such extension is challenging; the hierarchy of concepts that describe an outdoor environment is more complex than for indoors, and manually defining such hierarchy is time-consuming and does not scale. Furthermore, the lack of training data prevents the straightforward application of learning-based tools used in indoor settings. To address these challenges, we propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a spatial ontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second, we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., 'a beach contains sand'), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a variety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and show that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene graph generation with sparsely annotated data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3d Scene Graphs; Ai-based Methods; Semantic Scene Understanding; Spatial Ontologies; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Personnel Training; Three Dimensional Computer Graphics; Three Dimensional Displays; 3d Scene Graph; 3d Scenes; Ai-based Method; Ontology's; Scene Understanding; Scene-graphs; Semantic Scene Understanding; Solid Modelling; Spatial Ontologies; Three-dimensional Display; Training Data; Semantics","Modeling languages; Ontology; Personnel training; Three dimensional computer graphics; Three dimensional displays; 3d scene graph; 3D scenes; AI-based method; Ontology's; Scene understanding; Scene-graphs; Semantic scene understanding; Solid modelling; Spatial ontologies; Three-dimensional display; Training data; Semantics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85189615964"

However, even though there is a wealth of high-quality written materials on surgery, and the scientific community has shown a growing interest in the application of natural language processing techniques in surgery, a pre-trained language model specific to the surgical domain is still missing. The creation and public release of such a model would serve numerous useful clinical applications. For example, it could enhance existing surgical knowledge bases employed for task automation, or assist medical students in summarizing complex surgical descriptions. For this reason, in this paper, we introduce SurgicBERTa, a pre-trained language model specific for the English surgical language, i.e., the language used in the surgical domain. SurgicBERTa has been obtained from RoBERTa through continued pre-training with the Masked language modeling objective on 300 k sentences taken from English surgical books and papers, for a total of 7 million words. By publicly releasing SurgicBERTa, we make available a resource built from the content collected in many high-quality surgical books, online textual resources, and academic papers. We performed several assessments in order to evaluate SurgicBERTa, comparing it with the general domain RoBERTa. First, we intrinsically assessed the model in terms of perplexity, accuracy, and evaluation loss resulting from the continual training according to the masked language modeling task. Then, we extrinsically evaluated SurgicBERTa on several downstream tasks, namely (i) procedural sentence detection, (ii) procedural knowledge extraction, (iii) ontological information discovery, and (iv) surgical terminology acquisition. Finally, we conducted some qualitative analysis on SurgicBERTa, showing that it contains a lot of surgical knowledge that could be useful to enrich existing state-of-the-art surgical knowledge bases or to extract surgical knowledge. All the assessments show that SurgicBERTa better deals with surgical language than a general-purpose pre-trained language model such as RoBERTa, and therefore can be effectively exploited in many computer-assisted applications in the surgical domain. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Language Models; Medicine; Natural Language Processing; Transformers; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Natural Language Processing Systems; Surgery; High Quality; Language Model; Language Processing; Language Processing Techniques; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Real-world; Scientific Community; Still Missing; Transformer; Modeling Languages","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Natural language processing systems; Surgery; High quality; Language model; Language processing; Language processing techniques; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Real-world; Scientific community; Still missing; Transformer; Modeling languages","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168115302"

RDF2vec is a scalable embedding approach rooted in the combination of random walks with a language model. It has been successfully used in various applications. Recently, multiple variants to the RDF2vec approach have been proposed, introducing variations both on the walk generation and on the language modeling side. The combination of those different approaches has lead to an increasing family of RDF2vec variants. In this paper, we evaluate a total of twelve RDF2vec variants on a comprehensive set of benchmark models, and compare them to seven existing knowledge graph embedding methods from the family of link prediction approaches. Besides the established GEval benchmark introducing various downstream machine learning tasks on the DBpedia knowledge graph, we also use the new DLCC (Description Logic Class Constructors) benchmark consisting of two gold standards, one based on DBpedia, and one based on synthetically generated graphs. The latter allows for analyzing which ontological patterns in a knowledge graph can actually be learned by different embedding. With this evaluation, we observe that certain tailored RDF2vec variants can lead to improved performance on different downstream tasks, given the nature of the underlying problem, and that they, in particular, have a different behavior in modeling similarity and relatedness. The findings can be used to provide guidance in selecting a particular RDF2vec method for a given task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Embedding Evaluation; Knowledge Graph Embedding; Rdf2vec; Representation Learning","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193700037"

ICON generates new concepts by identifying implicit concepts based on the existing concept structure, generating names for such concepts and inserting them in appropriate positions within the taxonomy. ICON integrates techniques from entity retrieval, text summary, and subsumption prediction; this modular architecture offers high flexibility while achieving state-of-the-art performance.

When learners pursue independent learning using some educational tools, they face challenges in understanding and reasoning practice within this multidisciplinary field. Additionally, evaluating their learning outcomes comprehensively becomes problematic.

Implementing the method, we developed BIDTrainer, a BID education tool.

Earth Science Knowledge Graphs can integrate geoscience knowledge,enhance research efficiency,and facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration. By analyzing network connections and semantic relationships,they uncover knowledge associations and patterns,andaid researchers in identifying new domains and posing novel research questions. Unlike conventional advancements in large-scale modeling technologies, Knowledge Graph offers precise knowledge that enhances both the intelligence and dependability of generated outcomes from such models. Firstly,this study provides a detailed exposition of Knowledge Graph concepts and construction methods. Knowledge Graphs,as a form of data graph,are designed to collect and convey knowledge from the real world. Their universal expression is in the form of triples,consisting of head entities,tail entities,and the relationships between them. Knowledge Graphs have emerged as a significant approach for organizing structured knowledge and integrating information from multiple data sources in the organizational world. Their architectural framework primarily encompasses four components:source data acquisition,knowledge fusion, knowledge computation,and knowledge application. Source data acquisition stands as the primary step in building Knowledge Graphs,focusing on extracting useful information from various types of data. Knowledge fusion is pivotal in addressing the heterogeneity of different Knowledge Graphs,with the aim of enhancing their quality through integration. Knowledge computation represents the primary output capability of Knowledge Graphs,currently applied in fields such as semantic search,question answering,and visualization analysis. Knowledge Graph construction technology enables the extraction of information from structured,unstructured,and semi-structured data sources,organizing this information into knowledge and presenting it in graphical form. Presently,the construction of Knowledge Graphs in the field of Earth Sciences primarily employs two methods:Top-down and bottom-up approaches,with the overarching principle being the synthesis of both methods while allowing flexibility in their specific sequencing. Secondly,this study offers a comprehensive introduction to the widely applied top-level ontology,the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) model,in the scientific domain. The paper briefly summarizes existing Knowledge Graph in the geoscience field,emphasizing the GeoCore Ontology and Geoscience ontology (GSO) in the Earth Science domain,highlighting their similarities and differences. BFO,comprising 38 classes,is designed to facilitate information integration,retrieval,and analysis in scientific research. Presently,BFO has been successfully employed in over 350 ontology projects worldwide. The GeoCore Ontology,built upon BFO, serves as a specialized framework to describe the core concepts within the domain of Earth Science,rigorously defining a set of universal geological concepts during its development. Conversely,GSO provides a systematic framework for representing crucial geological science knowledge,encompassing three hierarchical layers:foundational,geological,and detailed modules. GeoCore can be viewed as an intermediary layer within GSO,which can be further expanded,while detailed modules have already been constructed within GSO. Additionally, researchers worldwide employ various methods such as literature mining,domain expert interviews,and data mining techniques to extract Earth Science knowledge from relevant literature, databases,and open data,subsequently to construct Knowledge Graphs. These Knowledge Graphs are found in applications across various domains including geological exploration,natural disaster prediction,and environmental conservation,and are utilized in practical projects such as oil and gas exploration,water resource management,and climate change research. In summary,the application scope of Earth Science Knowledge Graphs is extensive,providing a crucial foundation of data and knowledge for scientific research,decision support,and sustainable development. Finally,the study introduces international Earth Science data science initiatives such as the Deep-time Digital Earth (DDE) project related to constructing Earth Science Knowledge Graph,and the challenges and application prospects for the future development of Earth Science Knowledge Graph,with a focus on seismic science. The DDE aims to connect and coordinate global deep-earth data,promoting the sharing of geoscientific knowledge worldwide and facilitating research on Earth's evolution in a data-driven manner. Apart from the DDE,numerous domestic and international organizations and initiatives are driving the development of Knowledge Graph in Earth Science,such as OneGeology,EarthCube,and LinkedGeoData projects. Despite facing various challenges,Knowledge Graph is gradually overcoming these hurdles with advancements in technology and tools. These challenges are not exclusive to the field of Earth Science but are prevalent across all Knowledge Graph construction endeavors. However,due to the complexity and diversity of Earth Science,Knowledge Graph construction in this field encounters unique difficulties. Nevertheless,there is ample room for the creation and application of Knowledge Graph in Earth Science,with the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs) bringing forth new opportunities. Earthquake Science,as a crucial branch of Earth Science,encompasses intersections of multiple primary disciplines such as geology,geophysics,and engineering seismology. However,the application of Knowledge Graphs in the field of Earthquake Science still faces significant gaps and urgently requires further research building upon existing models. In conclusion,the future development of Earth Science Knowledge Graphs will be an ongoing process of evolution and refinement,bringing more opportunities and benefits for fields such as Earth Science research,decision-making,and public education through sustained technological innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earth Science; Geological Ontology; Knowledge Graph; Ontology Construction; Data Acquisition; Data Mining; Data Set; Earth Science; Knowledge; Seismic Data","data acquisition; data mining; data set; Earth science; knowledge; seismic data","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196662469"

However, the role of endoplasmic reticulum stress-related genes (ERSRGs) in type A aortic dissection has not yet been fully clarified. Methods: Differentially expressed genes in the aorta of type A aortic dissection patients were analyzed based on the GSE52093 database. The ERSRGs were downloaded from the GeneCards website. Functional enrichment analysis and protein–protein interaction analysis were performed on the acquired differentially expressed ERSRGs. The mRNA expression of the 5 top key differentially expressed ERSRGs was further explored in GSE153434 and clinical samples. Immune infiltration correlation analysis was performed on the validated key genes. Finally, we constructed regulatory networks of transcription factors, miRNAs, and chemicals. Results: Twelve differentially expressed ERSRGs were identified, of which 8 genes were downregulated and 4 genes were upregulated. GeneMANIA was adopted to analyze these genes and their interacting proteins, and the results showed that the main function was calcium ion transport. Four key genes, ACTC1, CASQ2, SPP1, and REEP1, were validated in GSE153434 and clinical samples. The area under the ROC curve values for ACTC1, CASQ2, SPP1, and REEP1 were 0.92, 0.96, 0.89, and 1.00, respectively. ACTC1 and REEP1 correlated with multiple immune cells. Many transcription factors, microRNAs, and chemicals were identified with the potential to regulate these 4 key genes. Conclusion: In this study, we identified 12 differentially expressed ERSRGs by analyzing the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Four key genes may influence the development of type A aortic dissection by regulating endoplasmic reticulum stress. These results expand our understanding of type A aortic dissection, and the 4 key genes are expected to be diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aortic Dissection; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Ontology; Calcium Ion; Hiscript Ii Q Rtsuperpmix; R Software V1.03; Calcium Ion; Microrna; Transcription Factor; Actc1; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Casq2; Cd8+ T Lymphocyte; Cell Infiltration; Coronary Artery Bypass Graft; Correlation Analysis; Dendritic Cell; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Differential Gene Expression; Down Regulation; Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress; Functional Enrichment Analysis; Gene; Gene Expression; Gene Ontology; Gse153434; Human; Immunocompetent Cell; Ion Transport; Ischemic Heart Disease; Language Model; Macrophage; Mrna Expression Level; Natural Killer Cell; Protein Protein Interaction; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Reep1; Regulatory T Lymphocyte; Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction; Rna Extraction; Spp1; Type A Aortic Dissection; Upregulation","calcium ion; microRNA; transcription factor; ACTC1; Article; artificial intelligence; CASQ2; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell infiltration; coronary artery bypass graft; correlation analysis; dendritic cell; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential gene expression; down regulation; endoplasmic reticulum stress; functional enrichment analysis; gene; gene expression; gene ontology; GSE153434; human; immunocompetent cell; ion transport; ischemic heart disease; language model; macrophage; mRNA expression level; natural killer cell; protein protein interaction; receiver operating characteristic; REEP1; regulatory T lymphocyte; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; RNA extraction; SPP1; type A aortic dissection; upregulation","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191976337"

However, the predominant reliance on empirical assessments using specific benchmark datasets for evaluating these models raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and efficiency of current evaluation methods. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel quantitative approach for estimating the performance of transferring multi-task pre-trained protein representations to downstream tasks. This transferability-based method is designed to quantify the similarities in latent space distributions between pre-trained features and those fine-tuned for downstream tasks. It encompasses a broad spectrum, covering multiple domains and a variety of heterogeneous tasks. To validate this method, we constructed a diverse set of protein-specific pre-training tasks. The resulting protein representations were then evaluated across several downstream biological tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate a robust correlation between the transferability scores obtained using our method and the actual transfer performance observed. This significant correlation highlights the potential of our method as a more comprehensive and efficient tool for evaluating protein representation learning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Optimal Transport; Protein Representation Learning; Transferability; Protein; Proteins; Biological Systems; Computational Linguistics; Information Theory; Job Analysis; Learning Systems; Biological Information Theories; Biological System Modeling; Computational Modelling; Down-stream; Optimal Transport; Predictive Models; Protein Engineering; Protein Representation Learning; Task Analysis; Transferability; Proteins; Accuracy; Algorithm; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Computer Model; Drug Development; Gene Ontology; Human; Language Model; Learning; Mathematical Model; Natural Language Processing; Probability; Protein Function; Protein Language Model; Protein Representation Learning; Protein Structure; Sequence Homology; Bioinformatics; Machine Learning; Procedures; Protein Database; Protein; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Humans; Machine Learning","Biological systems; Computational linguistics; Information theory; Job analysis; Learning systems; Biological information theories; Biological system modeling; Computational modelling; Down-stream; Optimal transport; Predictive models; Protein engineering; Protein representation learning; Task analysis; Transferability; Proteins; accuracy; algorithm; amino acid sequence; Article; computer model; drug development; gene ontology; human; language model; learning; mathematical model; natural language processing; probability; protein function; protein language model; protein representation learning; protein structure; sequence homology; bioinformatics; machine learning; procedures; protein database; protein; Algorithms; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Humans; Machine Learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186999797"

Our investigation used an annotated cultural tourism resource dataset containing 2,745 items across 16 cultural types. The results showed accuracy scores for FT-ERNIE and ChatGPT of 0.81 and 0.12, respectively, with FT-ERNIE achieving a micro-F1 score of 0.93, a 26 percentage point lead over ChatGPT's score of 0.67. These underscore FT-ERNIE's superior performance (the shortcoming is the need to annotate data) while highlighting ChatGPT's limitations because of insufficient Chinese training data and lower identification accuracy in professional knowledge.

Digitalization offers technologies for data-driven decision-making, but many maintenance decisions still lack a factual basis. Prioritizing efficiency and effectiveness require analyzing equipment history, facilitated by using Computerized Maintenance Management Systems (CMMS). However, CMMS data often contains unstructured free-text, leading to manual analysis, which is resource-intensive and reactive, focusing on short time periods and specific equipment. Two approaches are available to solve the issue: minimizing free-text entries or using advanced methods for processing them. Free-text allows detailed descriptions but may lack completeness, while structured reporting aids automated analysis but may limit fault description richness. As knowledge and experience are vital assets for companies this research uses a hybrid approach by combining Natural Language Processing with domain specific ontology and Large Language Models to extract information from free-text entries, enabling the possibility of real-time analysis e.g., identifying recurring failure and knowledge sharing across global sites. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Experience Reuse; Industrial Maintenance; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Computational Linguistics; Decision Making; Failure (mechanical); Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Computerized Maintenance Management System; Experience Reuse; Free Texts; Industrial Maintenance; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Text Entry; Maintenance","Computational linguistics; Decision making; Failure (mechanical); Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Computerized maintenance management system; Experience reuse; Free texts; Industrial maintenance; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Text entry; Maintenance","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191305248"

Effective assessment of stroke severity is vital for an accurate diagnosis, appropriate treatment, and optimal clinical outcomes. The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a widely used scale for quantitatively assessing stroke severity. However, the current manual scoring of NIHSS is labor-intensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unreliable. Applying artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to automate the quantitative assessment of stroke on vast amounts of electronic health records (EHRs) has attracted much interest. Objective: This study aims to develop an automatic, quantitative stroke severity assessment framework through automating the entire NIHSS scoring process on Chinese clinical EHRs. Methods: Our approach consists of two major parts: Chinese clinical named entity recognition (CNER) with a domain-adaptive pre-trained large language model (LLM) and automated NIHSS scoring. To build a high-performing CNER model, we first construct a stroke-specific, densely annotated dataset “Chinese Stroke Clinical Records” (CSCR) from EHRs provided by our partner hospital, based on a stroke ontology that defines semantically related entities for stroke assessment. We then pre-train a Chinese clinical LLM coined “CliRoberta” through domain-adaptive transfer learning and construct a deep learning-based CNER model that can accurately extract entities directly from Chinese EHRs. Finally, an automated, end-to-end NIHSS scoring pipeline is proposed by mapping the extracted entities to relevant NIHSS items and values, to quantitatively assess the stroke severity. Results: Results obtained on a benchmark dataset CCKS2019 and our newly created CSCR dataset demonstrate the superior performance of our domain-adaptive pre-trained LLM and the CNER model, compared with the existing benchmark LLMs and CNER models. The high F1 score of 0.990 ensures the reliability of our model in accurately extracting the entities for the subsequent automatic NIHSS scoring. Subsequently, our automated, end-to-end NIHSS scoring approach achieved excellent inter-rater agreement (0.823) and intraclass consistency (0.986) with the ground truth and significantly reduced the processing time from minutes to a few seconds. Conclusion: Our proposed automatic and quantitative framework for assessing stroke severity demonstrates exceptional performance and reliability through directly scoring the NIHSS from diagnostic notes in Chinese clinical EHRs. Moreover, this study also contributes a new clinical dataset, a pre-trained clinical LLM, and an effective deep learning-based CNER model. The deployment of these advanced algorithms can improve the accuracy and efficiency of clinical assessment, and help improve the quality, affordability and productivity of healthcare services. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Stroke Severity Assessment; Chinese Electronic Health Records; Clinical Named Entity Recognition; Domain-adaptive Pre-training; Large Language Model; Benchmarking; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; E-learning; Natural Language Processing Systems; Records Management; Automatic Stroke Severity Assessment; Chinese Electronic Health Record; Clinical Named Entity Recognition; Domain-adaptive Pre-training; Electronic Health; Health Records; Language Model; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Pre-training; Automation; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Automation; Cerebrovascular Accident; Chinese; Chinese Clinical Named Entity Recognition; Clinical Assessment; Clinical Evaluation; Clinical Outcome; Comparative Study; Conceptual Framework; Deep Learning; Disease Severity; Electronic Health Record; Health Service; Hospital Care; Human; Interrater Reliability; Laboratory Test; Large Language Model; National Institutes Of Health Stroke Scale; Ontology; Outcome Assessment; Quantitative Analysis; Recognition; Reliability; Transfer Of Learning; China; Language; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility; Artificial Intelligence; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Language; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility Of Results; Stroke","Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Diagnosis; E-learning; Natural language processing systems; Records management; Automatic stroke severity assessment; Chinese electronic health record; Clinical named entity recognition; Domain-adaptive pre-training; Electronic health; Health records; Language model; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Pre-training; Automation; Article; artificial intelligence; automation; cerebrovascular accident; Chinese; Chinese clinical named entity recognition; clinical assessment; clinical evaluation; clinical outcome; comparative study; conceptual framework; deep learning; disease severity; electronic health record; health service; hospital care; human; interrater reliability; laboratory test; large language model; National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale; ontology; outcome assessment; quantitative analysis; recognition; reliability; transfer of learning; China; language; natural language processing; reproducibility; Artificial Intelligence; Electronic Health Records; Humans; Language; Natural Language Processing; Reproducibility of Results; Stroke","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186860362"

Objective: To assess and compare ChatGPT’s responses to the clinical questions and recommendations proposed by The 2011 North American Spine Society (NASS) Clinical Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of Degenerative Lumbar Spinal Stenosis (LSS). We explore the advantages and disadvantages of ChatGPT’s responses through an updated literature review on spinal stenosis. Methods: We prompted ChatGPT with questions from the NASS Evidence-based Clinical Guidelines for LSS and compared its generated responses with the recommendations provided by the guidelines. A review of the literature was performed via PubMed, OVID, and Cochrane on the diagnosis and treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis between January 2012 and April 2023. Results: 14 questions proposed by the NASS guidelines for LSS were uploaded into ChatGPT and directly compared to the responses offered by NASS. Three questions were on the definition and history of LSS, one on diagnostic tests, seven on non-surgical interventions and three on surgical interventions. The review process found 40 articles that were selected for inclusion that helped corroborate or contradict the responses that were generated by ChatGPT. Conclusions: ChatGPT’s responses were similar to findings in the current literature on LSS. These results demonstrate the potential for implementing ChatGPT into the spine surgeon’s workplace as a means of supporting the decision-making process for LSS diagnosis and treatment. However, our narrative summary only provides a limited literature review and additional research is needed to standardize our findings as means of validating ChatGPT’s use in the clinical space. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Guidelines; Decision-making; Large Language Models; Lumbar Stenosis; Spine; Acetylsalicylic Acid; Duloxetine; Endorphin; Gabapentin; Ibuprofen; Naproxen; Paracetamol; Acetylsalicylic Acid; Anticonvulsive Agent; Antidepressant Agent; Corticosteroid; Duloxetine; Endorphin; Gabapentin; Ibuprofen; Naproxen; Nonsteroid Antiinflammatory Agent; Paracetamol; Adult; Aerobic Exercise; Analgesia; Artificial Intelligence; Atrophy; Claudication; Cochrane Library; Decision Making; Decompression; Diagnostic Imaging; Electromyography; Electrostimulation; Functional Electrical Stimulation; Human; Large Language Model; Lumbar Puncture; Lumbar Spinal Stenosis; Manipulative Medicine; Medical Ontology; Medline; Myelography; Nerve Root; Neurogenic Claudication; Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation; Neuropathic Pain; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Paresthesia; Practice Guideline; Prognosis; Questionnaire; Radicular Pain; Range Of Motion; Review; Spinal Cord Disease; Spine; Spine Fusion; Spine Manipulation; Spine Surgery; Spondylolisthesis; Surgeon; Systematic Review; Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation; Vertebral Canal Stenosis; Weakness; X Ray; X-ray Computed Tomography","acetylsalicylic acid; anticonvulsive agent; antidepressant agent; corticosteroid; duloxetine; endorphin; gabapentin; ibuprofen; naproxen; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; paracetamol; adult; aerobic exercise; analgesia; artificial intelligence; atrophy; claudication; Cochrane Library; decision making; decompression; diagnostic imaging; electromyography; electrostimulation; functional electrical stimulation; human; large language model; lumbar puncture; lumbar spinal stenosis; manipulative medicine; medical ontology; Medline; myelography; nerve root; neurogenic claudication; neuromuscular electrical stimulation; neuropathic pain; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; paresthesia; practice guideline; prognosis; questionnaire; radicular pain; range of motion; Review; spinal cord disease; spine; spine fusion; spine manipulation; spine surgery; spondylolisthesis; surgeon; systematic review; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation; vertebral canal stenosis; weakness; X ray; x-ray computed tomography","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167623905"

One of the major impediments to this automation is the difficulty in establishing the relationship between the underwriting exclusions that a policy has and the incoming claim's diagnosis information. Typically, policy underwriting exclusions are captured in free-text such as “Respiratory illnesses are excluded due to a pre-existing asthma condition”. A medical claim coming from a hospital would have the diagnosis represented using the International Classification of Disease (ICD) codes from the World Health Organization. The complex and labour-intensive task of establishing the relationship between free-text underwriting exclusions in health insurance policies and medical diagnosis codes from health insurance claims is critical towards determining if a claim should be rejected due to underwriting exclusions. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages both explicit and implicit domain knowledge present in medical ontologies and pre-trained language models respectively, to effectively establish the relationship between free-text describing medical conditions present in underwriting exclusions and the ICD-10CM diagnosis codes in health insurance claims.

The critical challenge lies in the unclear and unreliable fact distribution within LLMs trained on vast amounts of data. The prevalent approach frames the factual detection task as a question-answering paradigm, where the LLMs are asked about factual knowledge and examined for correctness. However, existing studies primarily focused on deriving test cases only from several specific domains, such as movies and sports, limiting the comprehensive observation of missing knowledge and the analysis of unexpected hallucinations. To address this issue, we propose OntoFact, an adaptive framework for detecting unknown facts of LLMs, devoted to mining the ontology-level skeleton of the missing knowledge. Specifically, we argue that LLMs could expose the ontology-based similarity among missing facts and introduce five representative knowledge graphs (KGs) as benchmarks. We further devise a sophisticated ontology-driven reinforcement learning (ORL) mechanism to produce error-prone test cases with specific entities and relations automatically. The ORL mechanism rewards the KGs for navigating toward a feasible direction for unveiling factual errors. Moreover, empirical efforts demonstrate that dominant LLMs are biased towards answering Yes rather than No, regardless of whether this knowledge is included. To mitigate the overconfidence of LLMs, we leverage a hallucination-free detection (HFD) strategy to tackle unfair comparisons between baselines, thereby boosting the result robustness. Experimental results on 5 datasets, using 32 representative LLMs, reveal a general lack of fact in current LLMs. Notably, ChatGPT exhibits fact error rates of 51.6% on DBpedia and 64.7% on YAGO, respectively. Additionally, the ORL mechanism demonstrates promising error prediction scores, with F1 scores ranging from 70% to 90% across most LLMs. Compared to the exhaustive testing, ORL achieves an average recall of 80% while reducing evaluation time by 35.29% to 63.12%. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Errors; Knowledge Graph; Musculoskeletal System; Ontology; Critical Challenges; Detection Tasks; Factual Knowledge; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Learning Mechanism; Ontology's; Question Answering; Reinforcement Learnings; Test Case; Reinforcement Learning","Errors; Knowledge graph; Musculoskeletal system; Ontology; Critical challenges; Detection tasks; Factual knowledge; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Learning mechanism; Ontology's; Question Answering; Reinforcement learnings; Test case; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186379985"

Most existing superior NER models employ the standard fully supervised paradigm, which requires a large amount of annotated data during training. In order to maintain performance with insufficient annotation resources (i.e., low resources), in-context learning (ICL) has drawn a lot of attention, due to its plug-and-play nature compared to other methods (e.g., meta-learning and prompt learning). In this manner, how to retrieve high-correlated demonstrations for target sentences serves as the key to emerging ICL ability. For the NER task, the correlation implies the consistency of both ontology (i.e., generalized entity type) and context (i.e., sentence semantic), which is ignored by previous NER demonstration retrieval techniques. To address this issue, we propose ConsistNER, a novel three-stage framework that incorporates ontological and contextual information for low-resource NER. Firstly, ConsistNER employs large language models (LLMs) to pre-recognize potential entities in a zero-shot manner. Secondly, ConsistNER retrieves the sentence-specific demonstrations for each target sentence based on the two following considerations: (1) Regarding ontological consistency, demonstrations are filtered into a candidate set based on ontology distribution. (2) Regarding contextual consistency, an entity-aware self-attention mechanism is introduced to focus more on the potential entities and semantic-correlated tokens. Finally, ConsistNER feeds the retrieved demonstrations for all target sentences into LLMs for prediction. We conduct experiments on four widely-adopted NER datasets, including both general and specific domains. Experimental results show that ConsistNER achieves a 6.01%-26.37% and 3.07%-21.18% improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines on Micro-F1 scores under 1- and 5-shot settings, respectively. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ontology; Semantics; Zero-shot Learning; Context Learning; In Contexts; Language Model; Large Amounts; Metalearning; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology's; Performance; Plug-and-play; Recognition Models; Demonstrations","Ontology; Semantics; Zero-shot learning; Context learning; In contexts; Language model; Large amounts; Metalearning; Named entity recognition; Ontology's; Performance; Plug-and-play; Recognition models; Demonstrations","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85186365966"

Conversely, EKGs provide transparency and explainability on the conclusions drawn, a typical weak point of LLMs, which operate opaquely.

As elaborated by Miranda Fricker (2010), Western White male actors traditionally dominate knowledge production; therefore, ChatGPT and other LLMs are inclined to reproduce patriarchal perspectives as universal understandings of the World. Our commentary applies this logic to accounting practice and research in Africa, and asserts that epistemic injustice, resulting from colonization and racism, means that ontological and epistemological approaches situated in the accounting needs and experiences of African communities are missing from or poorly articulated by ChatGPT and other LLMs. If LLMs are to attain legitimacy as (ethical) sources of knowledge, regulation must be enforced to ensure transparency—as a foundation for promoting pluriversality and eliminating epistemic injustice. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accounting; Africa; Chatgpt; Epistemic Injustice; Large Language Models; Pluriversality","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192186390"

AI/NLP approaches can assist expert curators in populating these knowledge bases, but current approaches rely on extensive training data, and are not able to populate arbitrarily complex nested knowledge schemas. Results: Here we present Structured Prompt Interrogation and Recursive Extraction of Semantics (SPIRES), a Knowledge Extraction approach that relies on the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform zero-shot learning and general-purpose query answering from flexible prompts and return information conforming to a specified schema. Given a detailed, user-defined knowledge schema and an input text, SPIRES recursively performs prompt interrogation against an LLM to obtain a set of responses matching the provided schema. SPIRES uses existing ontologies and vocabularies to provide identifiers for matched elements. We present examples of applying SPIRES in different domains, including extraction of food recipes, multispecies cellular signaling pathways, disease treatments, multi-step drug mechanisms, and chemical to disease relationships. Current SPIRES accuracy is comparable to the mid-range of existing Relation Extraction methods, but greatly surpasses an LLM’s native capability of grounding entities with unique identifiers. SPIRES has the advantage of easy customization, flexibility, and, crucially, the ability to perform new tasks in the absence of any new training data. This method supports a general strategy of leveraging the language interpreting capabilities of LLMs to assemble knowledge bases, assisting manual knowledge curation and acquisition while supporting validation with publicly-available databases and ontologies external to the LLM.

While early scholars (Galileo, da Vinci, etc.) were experts across fields, specialization took hold later. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence, we can now explore relationships across areas (e.g., mechanics-biology) or disparate domains (e.g., failure mechanics-art). To achieve this, we use a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), here for a subset of knowledge in multiscale materials failure. The approach includes the use of a general-purpose LLM to distill question-answer pairs from raw sources followed by LLM fine-tuning. The resulting MechGPTLLMfoundation model is used in a series of computational experiments to explore its capacity for knowledge retrieval, various language tasks, hypothesis generation, and connecting knowledge across disparate areas. While the model has some ability to recall knowledge from training, we find that LLMs are particularly useful for extracting structural insights through Ontological Knowledge Graphs. These interpretable graph structures provide explanatory insights, frameworks for new research questions, and visual representations of knowledge that also can be used in retrieval-augmented generation. Three versions of MechGPT are discussed, featuring different sizes from 13×109 to 70×109 parameters, and reaching context lengths of more than 10,000 tokens. This provides ample capacity for sophisticated retrieval augmented strategies, as well as agentbased modeling where multiple LLMs interact collaboratively and/or adversarially, the incorporation of new data from the literature or web searches, as well as multimodality. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai; Attention; Failure; Gpt; Human-machine; Language Model; Materials; Mechanics; Scientific Ml; Transformer; Computational Linguistics; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Attention; Galileo; Gpt; Human-machine; Language Model; Material Modeling; Mechanic Model; Scientific Ml; Specialisation; Transformer; Failure (mechanical)","Computational linguistics; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Attention; GALILEO; GPT; Human-machine; Language model; Material modeling; Mechanic model; Scientific ML; Specialisation; Transformer; Failure (mechanical)","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184374431"

Many methods have been developed to automatically predict protein functions, but effectively exploiting all the axioms in the GO for knowledge-enhanced learning has remained a challenge. We have developed DeepGO-SE, a method that predicts GO functions from protein sequences using a pretrained large language model. DeepGO-SE generates multiple approximate models of GO, and a neural network predicts the truth values of statements about protein functions in these approximate models.

Method: Through integrating two Bayesian diagnostic methods, a candidate list was generated with enhance clinical interpretability for the further Q&A based differential diagnosis (DDX). To achieve an efficient Q&A dialogue strategy, we introduce a novel metric named the adaptive information gain and Gini index (AIGGI) to evaluate the expected gain of interrogated phenotypes within real-time diagnostic states. Results: This DDX tool called RDmaster has been implemented as a web-based platform (http://rdmaster.nbscn.org/). A diagnostic trial involving 238 published RD patients revealed that RDmaster outperformed existing RD diagnostic tools, as well as ChatGPT, and was shown to enhance the diagnostic accuracy through its Q&A system. Conclusions: The RDmaster offers an effective multi-omics differential diagnostic technique and outperforms existing tools and popular large language models, particularly enhancing differential diagnosis in collecting diagnostically beneficial phenotypes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Differential Diagnosis; Electronic Differential Diagnostic Support System; Human Phenotype Ontology; Phenomic And Genomic Diagnostics; Rare Disease; 1,1 Dichloro 2,2 Bis(4 Chlorophenyl)ethylene; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Diagnosis; Diseases; Genes; Speech Processing; Diagnostic Support Systems; Dialogue Systems; Differential Diagnosis; Electronic Differential; Electronic Differential Diagnostic Support System; Genomics; Human Phenotype Ontology; Ontology's; Phenomic And Genomic Diagnostic; Rare Disease; Genome; Article; Chatgpt; Diagnostic Accuracy; Diagnostic Procedure; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Differential Diagnosis; Female; Gini Coefficient; Human; Human Computer Interaction; Knowledge Base; Major Clinical Study; Male; Multiomics; Phenotype; Rare Disease; Retrospective Study; Whole Exome Sequencing; Workflow; Bayes Theorem; Genetics; 1,1 Dichloro 2,2 Bis(4 Chlorophenyl)ethylene; Bayes Theorem; Diagnosis, Differential; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Humans; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","Diagnosis; Diseases; Genes; Speech processing; Diagnostic support systems; Dialogue systems; Differential diagnosis; Electronic differential; Electronic differential diagnostic support system; Genomics; Human phenotype ontology; Ontology's; Phenomic and genomic diagnostic; Rare disease; Genome; Article; ChatGPT; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; female; Gini coefficient; human; human computer interaction; knowledge base; major clinical study; male; multiomics; phenotype; rare disease; retrospective study; whole exome sequencing; workflow; Bayes theorem; genetics; 1,1 dichloro 2,2 bis(4 chlorophenyl)ethylene; Bayes Theorem; Diagnosis, Differential; Dichlorodiphenyl Dichloroethylene; Humans; Phenotype; Rare Diseases","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181539226"

Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy.

We propose a novel approach that leverages instruction tuning and advanced prompt strategies to enhance DST performance, without relying on any predefined ontologies. Our method enables Large Language Model (LLM) to infer dialogue states through carefully designed prompts and includes an anti-hallucination mechanism to ensure accurate tracking in diverse conversation contexts.

Our comparative analysis evaluates the strengths and limitations of OL, KGs, and LLMs across key metrics like accuracy, scalability, efficiency, robustness, and flexibility. The proposed framework leverages OL for systematic structuring, KGs for relational modeling, and LLMs for linguistic processing, enhancing translation accuracy and adaptability. However, integrating these approaches introduces scalability and processing efficiency trade-offs, particularly in resource-constrained environments. This study contributes to developing more sophisticated and scalable data translation models tailored for heterogeneous data environments, with practical implications for smart manufacturing and transportation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai In Transportation; Cross-standard Data Integration; Data Interoperability; Data Model Translation; Hybrid Ai Framework; Knowledge Graphs (kgs); Large Language Models (llms); Ontology Learning (ol); Semantic Mapping; Smart Manufacturing; Data Accuracy; Data Assimilation; Semantics; Spatio-temporal Data; Ai In Transportation; Cross-standard Data Integration; Data Interoperability; Data Model Translation; Hybrid Ai Framework; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model Translation; Ontology Learning; Semantics Mappings; Smart Manufacturing","Data accuracy; Data assimilation; Semantics; Spatio-temporal data; AI in transportation; Cross-standard data integration; Data interoperability; Data model translation; Hybrid AI framework; Knowledge graph; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Model translation; Ontology learning; Semantics mappings; Smart manufacturing","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218419329"

However, the vast amount of data contained in these reports is often unstructured, making it challenging to extract and normalize relevant clinical entities. Named Entity Normalization (NEN) is essential for mapping these entities to a standard ontology, facilitating better data integration, retrieval, and analysis. In this paper, we introduce RadLink, a benchmark for NEN in radiology. RadLink builds upon 425 expert-annotated radiology reports from the RadGraph dataset, extending it for NEN by mapping entities to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) ontology. We employ a combination of morphological and semantic matching approaches to generate normalization annotations, followed by human review for validation.

To protect user data and privacy, all organizations providing IoT devices must adhere to complex guidelines such as the National Institute of Standards and Technology Inter agency Report (NIST IR) 8259, which defines essential cybersecurity guidelines for IoT manufacturers. However, interpreting and applying these rules from these guidelines and the privacy policies remains a significant challenge for companies. Thus, this project presents a novel approach to extract knowledge from NIST 8259 for creating semantically rich ontology mappings. Our ontology captures key compliance rules, which are stored in a knowledge graph (KG) that allows organizations to crosscheck and update privacy policy documents with ease. The KG also enables real-time querying using SPARQL and offers a transparent view of regulatory adherence for IoT manufacturers and users. By automating the process of verifying cybersecurity compliance, the framework ensures that companies remain aligned with NIST standards, eliminating manual checks and reducing the risk of non-compliance.

While disease ontologies are useful for annotation, integration, and analysis of biological data, codified disease and procedure categories e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT, etc. rarely capture all of the nuances in a patient condition or, in the case of rare disease, may not even exist. Furthermore, there are multiple disease definitions used in data sources and publications, each having its own structure and hierarchy. Mapping between ontologies, finding disease clusters, and building a representation of the chosen disease area are resource-intensive, often requiring significant human capital. We propose the creation and curation of a patient knowledge graph utilizing large language model extraction techniques. In order to expand in volume and scale, knowledge graphs with generalized language capability allow for data to be extracted using natural language rather than being constrained by the exact terminology or hierarchy of existing ontologies. We develop a method of mapping back to existing ontologies such as MeSH, SNOMED-CT, RxNORM, HPO, etc. to ground the extracted entities to known entities in the medical community.We have access to one of the largest ambulatory care EHR databases in the country. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we benchmark our extraction in a test set with over 33.6M unique patients, in the area of patient search. In this case study, we perform a patient search for a rare disease: Dravet syndrome. Dravet syndrome was codified as an ICD10 recognizable disease in October 2020. In the following research, we describe our method of the construction of patient-specific knowledge graphs and subsequent searches for patients who exhibit symptoms of a particular disease. Using patients with confirmed ICD10 codes for Dravet syndrome as our ground truth, we utilize our LLM-based entity extraction techniques and formalize an algorithmic way of characterizing patients in a grounded ontology to assist in mapping patients to specific diseases. Finally, we present the results of a real-world discovery method on Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration (BPAN), identifying patients with a rare disease, where no ground truth currently exists. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Beta-propeller Protein-associated Neurodegeneration (bpan); Dravet Syndrome; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Ontology Mapping; Structured Extraction; Arthroplasty; Benchmarking; Data Curation; Decision Trees; Disease Control; Flow Visualization; Fracture Fixation; Neurodegenerative Diseases; Ontology; Photomapping; Propellers; Steganography; Beta-propeller Protein-associated Neurodegeneration; Dravet Syndrome; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Neurodegeneration; Ontology Mapping; Ontology's; Real-world; Structured Extraction; Knowledge Graph","Arthroplasty; Benchmarking; Data curation; Decision trees; Disease control; Flow visualization; Fracture fixation; Neurodegenerative diseases; Ontology; Photomapping; Propellers; Steganography; Beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration; Dravet syndrome; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Neurodegeneration; Ontology mapping; Ontology's; Real-world; Structured extraction; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85218046365"

The divers formats and organisation methods of these collections, ranging from traditional print media to digital archives and multimedia assets, can hinder researchers' ability to easily access and retrieve relevant information. This paper introduces an ontology-driven knowledge base to address this issue by enabling the efficient access to knowledge in the application domain and enhancing the semantic search capabilities in the field of Digital Humanities. Our approach focuses on the development of an ontology-drive knowledge base for semantic search in academic libraries by the example of the library of the Folkwang University of Arts that captures the knowledge concepts present in the library's archival collections. The resulting ontology framework provides a structured representation of domain knowledge, facilitating the integration of diverse data sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from the application domain into a triple store knowledge base. By leveraging SPARQL queries generated from Large Language Model (LLM) prompts, we aim to facilitate more intuitive and effective knowledge retrieval. This approach allows users to express their information needs in a more natural and flexible way, leading to more accurate and relevant search results. We evaluate the proposed ontology-driven knowledge base in terms of its integrity, consistency, flexibility, relevance, and scalability. Our evaluation methodology includes a combination of verification and validation techniques, including automated reasoners and query results based on competence questions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ontology engineering to enhance complex information retrieval in academic libraries. However, we also identify limitations related to processing speed for complex queries and the quality of search results. This research contributes to the field of computational archival science by providing a novel approach to semantic search in academic libraries.

We introduce Contextual Knowledge Graph Construction (CKGC), a novel approach enhancing vector-based RAG by dynamically building a knowledge graph that reflects inherent data structures and connections.CKGC leverages text chunking, large language models (LLMs), and ontology mapping. By segmenting text and using LLMs to identify key entities and relationships, CKGC constructs a contextualized knowledge graph enriching information representation. This bridges the gap between semantic similarity and deeper contextual understanding, enabling more accurate and nuanced retrieval.Experiments on 2,000 lease agreements demonstrate that CKGC significantly improves vector-based RAG in information retrieval and question answering tasks, with substantial gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Top-k Accuracy.

Efforts toward creating benchmarks to test LLMs' performance on queries, in particular for the field of medicine, have led to a few reputable benchmarks, but these are limited in scope because of the amount of human annotation required. Our framework addresses this issue by leveraging existing, large knowledge bases for medicine to generate vast query and answer sets dynamically, which are less likely to be memorized by LLMs. The framework rests on designing a few key knowledge patterns, which can then generate millions (potentially billions) of queries. This offers a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable alternative to human-curated annotations used in medical question-and-answer benchmarks. Applying our framework to a small sample of five drug related ontologies, we are already capable of more than 100,000 unique drug related queries, which is 10 to 1000 times larger than existing various human annotation efforts.

We first design prompts with HPO information and use a cutting-edge large language model GPT-4 to generate synonym augmentation for expanding distant supervised training data. We then propose an ontology vector-enhanced phenotype concept classification model to efficiently integrate the taxonomic hierarchical structure of HPO.

However, the specialized nature of the reports, the complexity of the contents, and the high accuracy requirements of the results pose significant challenges to the structuring task. In this paper, we develop an LLM-based method to extract structure information from medical report narratives. Defining the structuring problem as mapping the narrative reports to the domain ontology, we design a framework to develop specialized LLMs that automatically learn and establish the mappings. At the core of this framework are report partitioning and interactive training data generation modules are. By separating complete reports into logically independent segments and training the LLMs on these segments independently, the trained LLMs can accurately capture the semantic relationships within each segment. Additionally, we explore different LLMs and formulate a simplistic scoring method to compare their accuracy, enabling us to select the best-performing model. Experimental evaluation on a real-world breast ultrasound report dataset demonstrates that our method achieves high accuracy with a small training dataset (400 samples).

These texts are typically authored by individuals from diverse educational, cultural, and experiential backgrounds. The paper highlights the main linguistic and semantic issues that arise in the analysis of natural language text. Linguistic Text Mining is a computational approach that combines linguistic principles with computational techniques to extract high-quality information from natural language texts. Despite the frequent mentions of “Linguistic” and “Text-Mining” in scientific literature, no formal definition exists; this paper proposes one. It further explores LTMs potential in enhancing knowledge extraction by emphasizing linguistic features, such as multi-word units (MWUs). Traditional text analysis relies heavily on statistical methods, focusing on simple words, which are often polysemous, or on aggregating words without semantic context and this limits systems’ ability to interpret domain-specific semantics. By contrast, MWUs, like “credit card”, convey specific, unambiguous meanings, critical for identifying specialized domains. MWUs are typically organized within ontologies that represent distinct knowledge domains. Building on previous work, the study compares AUTOMETA, an ontology-based approach using finite automata for MWU identification, with large language model (LLM)-based and other ontology-driven Linguistic Text Mining methods. Findings suggest that integrating linguistic frameworks significantly improves information extraction, offering a deeper understanding of complex language structures. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Finite Automata; Linguistic; Linguistic Text Mining; Multi-word Unit; Natural Language Processing; Text Mining; Computational Linguistics; Finite Automata; Latent Semantic Analysis; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Language Processing; Linguistic Text Mining; Multiword Units; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Natural Languages Texts; Ontology's; Realtime Processing; Text-mining; Semantics","Computational linguistics; Finite automata; Latent semantic analysis; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Language processing; Linguistic text mining; Multiword units; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Natural languages texts; Ontology's; Realtime processing; Text-mining; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217166575"

This paper delves into the influential factors affecting the performance of using informal definitions to represent domain entities textually, Language Models to represent these definitions as embedding vectors, and the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify these embeddings into top-level ontology concepts. Also, we particularly focused on the Gene Ontology (GO) and Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontologies. We hypothesize that the embedding representation of informal definitions of highly specialized domains may present different behaviors regarding their proximity with other informal definitions of other domains, influencing the predicted top-level ontology concept. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a series of experiments using variations on the number of GO and ChEBI domain entities in the training sample of our classifier. Our results indicate that the relation between the proximity of domain entities in the embedding space and the top-level ontology concept of these domain entities varies according to the domain specificity. Also, this result is strongly influenced by how ontology developers write the informal definitions in each domain. The findings underscore the potential of informal definitions in reflecting top-level ontology concepts and point toward using consolidated domain entities in a domain ontology during the training stage of the classifier. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Informal Definition; Language Model; Ontology Learning; Top-level Ontology Classification; Classification (of Information); Embeddings; Modeling Languages; Nearest Neighbor Search; Chemical Entity; Domain Entities; Gene Ontology; Informal Definition; Language Model; Ontology Concepts; Ontology Learning; Ontology's; Top-level Ontology Classification; Gene Ontology","Classification (of information); Embeddings; Modeling languages; Nearest neighbor search; Chemical entity; Domain entities; Gene ontology; Informal definition; Language model; Ontology concepts; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Top-level ontology classification; Gene Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217157524"

Churning through large volumes of legal documents is a daily requirement for a large number of professionals who need access to the information embedded in them. Natural Language Processing(NLP) methods that help in document summarization with key information components, insight extraction and question answering play a crucial role in legal text processing. Most of the existing document analysis systems use supervised machine learning, which require large volumes of annotated training data for every different application and are expensive to build. In this paper we propose a legal text analytics pipeline using Large Language Models (LLMs), which can work with little or no training data. For document summarization, we propose an iterative pipeline using retrieval augmented generation to ensure that the generated text remains contextually relevant. For question answering, we propose a novel ontology-driven ensemble approach similar to cross-examination that exploits questioning and verification principles. A knowledge graph, created with the extracted information, stores the key entities and relationships reflecting the repository content structure. A new dataset is created with Indian court documents related to bail applications for cases filed under POCSO1 Act. Analysis of insights extracted from the answers reveal patterns of crime and social conditions leading to those crimes, which are important inputs for social scientists as well as legal system. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crime; Data Analytics; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Personnel Training; Semi-supervised Learning; Document Summarization; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Volumes; Legal Documents; Legal Texts; Natural Languages; Processing Method; Question Answering; Text Analytics; Question Answering","Crime; Data Analytics; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Personnel training; Semi-supervised learning; Document summarization; Language model; Language processing; Large volumes; Legal documents; Legal texts; Natural languages; Processing method; Question Answering; Text analytics; Question answering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216927826"

To address this issue, previous research has developed systems that construct Knowledge Graphs (KG) based on simulations of daily household activities, and studies have been conducted on detecting hazardous behaviors using such KG analysis. In this current study, we propose a system capable of presenting the reason and justification for the detected domestic hazardous behaviors. Our system will first generates the reason for the detected behavior using a Large Language Model (LLM). To ensure the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of the LLM output, the system will provides reliable sources to support the output. We employed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search for sentences similar to the reason generated by the LLM within reliable, authoritative documents describing domestic accident cases and their causes and these will be presented as the evidence alongside the search engine results to the users. Consequently, a knowledge graph (KG) of domestic hazardous behavior is developed based on evidence ontology. Finally, to evaluate the ability of our proposed system in appropriately generating reasons for domestic hazardous behaviors and the adequacy of the justifications provided, the output was rated using LLMs and human volunteers. The rating results showed a significant correlation between LLMs and human evaluation, indicating that the proposed system can provide sufficient reasons and justifications for domestic hazardous behaviors at residential setting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Explainable Ai; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Behavior-based; Daily Activity; Explainable Ai; Graph-based; Home Environment; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Social Issues; Knowledge Graph","Behavior-based; Daily activity; Explainable AI; Graph-based; Home environment; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Retrieval-augmented generation; Social issues; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216925907"

Traditional approaches rely on the availability of extensive data or a tight set of constraints, while more recent approaches leverage large language models (LLMs) to verify task steps and replan accordingly. However, these methods often operate offline, necessitating scene resets and incurring in high costs. This paper introduces Recover, a neuro-symbolic framework for online failure identification and recovery. By integrating ontologies, logical rules, and LLM-based planners, Recover exploits symbolic information to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate recovery plans and also to decrease the associated costs. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our method in a simulated kitchen environment, we introduce OntoThor, an ontology describing the AI2Thor simulator setting. Empirical evaluation shows that OntoThor's logical rules accurately detect all failures in the analyzed tasks, and that Recover considerably outperforms, for both failure detection and recovery, a baseline method reliant solely on LLMs. Supplementary material, including the OntoThor ontology, is available at: https://recover-ontothor.github.io. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Robotics; Failure Detection And Recoveries; High Costs; Language Model; Logical Rules; Offline; Ontology's; Recovery Procedure; Task Executions; Traditional Approaches; Traditional Approachs; Ontology","Robotics; Failure detection and recoveries; High costs; Language model; Logical rules; Offline; Ontology's; Recovery procedure; Task executions; Traditional approaches; Traditional approachs; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216491450"

The growth of AI, particularly foundation models, such as large language models (LLMs) and visual language models (VLMs), is significantly shaping this sector. LLMs, by facilitating natural interactions and providing vast general knowledge, are proving invaluable for robotic tasks. This paper focuses on the benefits of LLMs for ""bring-me""tasks, where robots fetch specific items for users, often based on ambiguous instructions. Our previous efforts utilized an ontology extended to handle environmental data to resolve such ambiguities, but faced limitations when unresolvable ambiguities required user intervention for clarity. Here, we enhance our approach by integrating LLMs for providing additional commonsense knowledge, pairing it with ontological data to mitigate the issue of hallucinations and reduce the need for user queries, thus improving system usability.

For terms appearing infrequently in the dataset, there is little opportunity to improve these representations and learn semantic similarity with other concepts. Medical ontologies represent many biomedical concepts and define a relationship structure between these concepts, making ontologies a valuable source of domain-specific information. Holographic Reduced Representations (HRR) are capable of encoding ontological structure by composing atomic vectors to create structured higher-level concept vectors. We developed an embedding layer that generates concept vectors for clinical diagnostic codes by applying HRR operations that compose atomic vectors based on the SNOMED CT ontology. This approach allows for learning the atomic vectors while maintaining structure in the concept vectors. We trained a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from the Transformers (BERT) model to process sequences of clinical diagnostic codes and used the resulting HRR concept vectors as the embedding matrix for the model. The HRR-based approach introduced interpretable structure into code embeddings while maintaining or modestly improving performance on the masked language modeling (MLM) pre-training task (particularly for rare codes) as well as the fine-tuning tasks of mortality and disease prediction. This approach also better maintains semantic similarity between medically related concept vectors, due to both shared atomic vectors and disentangling of code-frequency information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Knowledge-integration; Ontology; Ontology; Semantics; Vectors; Clinical Diagnostics; Deep Learning; Embeddings; Encodings; Holographic Reduced Representations; Knowledge Integration; Medical Ontology; Ontology's; Semantic Similarity; Transformer Modeling; Encoding (symbols)","Ontology; Semantics; Vectors; Clinical diagnostics; Deep learning; Embeddings; Encodings; Holographic reduced representations; Knowledge integration; Medical ontology; Ontology's; Semantic similarity; Transformer modeling; Encoding (symbols)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216395492"

The matching task is not restricted to ontologies, it is also relevant for knowledge graphs. Ontology matching solutions based on transformer-based embeddings, textual similarity, logical mapping, or Large Language Models (LLMs) are still facing problems, mainly due to the lack of uniform information about the concepts and lack of homogeneous semantic granularity along different ontologies. In this work, we present a framework that combines vector-based similarity and string-based similarity through hybrid searches. LLMs are used to generate descriptions for ontology concepts, hence the concepts' representation is enriched and the alignment process can benefit from both the knowledge captured by the initial ontologies and the extended LLM-generated textual descriptions. The proposed system, HybridOM, is an unsupervised approach independent of the ontologies' domain. HybridOM is evaluated within Bio-ML 2024 track for the task of concept matching. It achieves the highest values for F1-score and Recall for most of the ontology pairs while maintaining a balance between precision and recall.

The second set of experiments target optimizing the prompt or enhancing shots through Large Language Model (LLM)-generated explanations, using three prompting frameworks: Explain then Translate, Question Decomposition Meaning Representation, and Optimization by Prompting. We evaluate these six prompting methods on the newly created Spider4SPARQL benchmark, as it is the most complex SPARQL-based Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) benchmark to date. Across the various prompting frameworks used, the commercial model is unable to achieve a score over 51%, indicating that KGQA, especially for complex queries, with multiple hops, set operations and filters remains a challenging task for LLMs. Our experiments find that the most successful prompting framework for KGQA is a simple prompt combined with an ontology and five random shots. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Question Answering; Llms; Prompt Engineering; Rdf; Sparql","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216184385"

These constraints, however, can typically not be guaranteed using standard (fine-tuned) encoder-decoder architectures. This has led to the development of constrained decoding approaches which allow, e.g., to specify constraints in form of context-free grammars. An open question is in how far an IE system can be effectively guided by a domain-specific grammar to ensure that the output structures follow the requirements of a certain domain data model. Methods: In this work we experimentally investigate the influence of grammar-constrained decoding as well as pointer generators on the performance of a domain-specific information extraction system. For this, we consider fine-tuned encoder-decoder models, Longformer and Flan-T5 in particular, and experimentally investigate whether the addition of grammar-constrained decoding and pointer generators improve information extraction results. Toward this goal, we consider the task of inducing structured representations from abstracts describing clinical trials, relying on the C-TrO ontology to semantically describe the clinical trials and their results. We frame the task as a slot filling problem where certain slots of templates need to be filled with token sequences occurring in the input text. We use a dataset comprising 211 annotated clinical trial abstracts about type 2 diabetes and glaucoma for training and evaluation. Our focus is on settings in which the available training data is in the order of a few hundred training examples, which we consider as a low-resource setting. Results: In all our experiments we could demonstrate the positive impact of grammar-constrained decoding, with an increase in F<inf>1</inf> score of pp 0.351 (absolute score 0.413) and pp 0.425 (absolute score 0.47) for the best-performing models on type 2 diabetes and glaucoma datasets, respectively. The addition of the pointer generators had a detrimental impact on the results, decreasing F<inf>1</inf> scores by pp 0.15 (absolute score 0.263) and pp 0.198 (absolute score 0.272) for the best-performing pointer generator models on type 2 diabetes and glaucoma datasets, respectively. Conclusion: The experimental results indicate that encoder-decoder models used for structure prediction for information extraction tasks in low-resource settings clearly benefit from grammar-constrained decoding guiding the output generation. In contrast, the evaluated pointer generator models decreased the performance drastically in some cases. Moreover, the performance of the pointer models appears to depend both on the used base model as well as the function used for aggregating the attention values. How the size of large language models affects the performance benefit of grammar-constrained decoding remains to be more structurally investigated in future work. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Trials; Deep Learning; Evidence-based Medicine; Generative Large Language Models; Grammar-constrained Decoding; Pico; Structured Information Extraction","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85215524351"

An essential aspect of enhancing the reliability of this system is fault diagnosis. However, the current fault diagnosis methods primarily rely on data-driven approaches, which often result in a high threshold for application due to their lack of interpretability. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach based on large language models for knowledge mining from textual data to extract fault information related to the fire water system, thereby enhancing the interpretability of data-driven fault diagnosis methods. The methodology followed in this paper consists of two main steps: firstly, analyzing the characteristics and principles of fire water system faults to develop a fault ontology, and secondly, creating a knowledge mining model using a large language model guided by the established fault ontology. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed model achieves an F1 score of 0.944, meeting the necessary criteria for effective knowledge mining in fire water system fault analysis. Furthermore, a comparative experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of various encoder models, including GRU, BiGRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and pre-trained large language model BERT. The results revealed a significant improvement in performance with the BERT encoder, showing increases in F1 scores of 22.12 %, 2.27 %, 17.41 %, and 3.16 % compared to the other models, respectively.

However, the extraction of medical context from drug indications remains poorly explored, as most research concentrates on the recognition of medications and associated diseases. Indeed, most databases cataloging drug indications do not contain their medical context in a machine-readable format. This paper proposes the use of a large language model for constructing DIAMOND-KG, a knowledge graph of drug indications and their medical context. The study 1) examines the change in accuracy and precision in providing additional instruction to the language model, 2) estimates the prevalence of medical context in drug indications, and 3) assesses the quality of DIAMOND-KG against NeuroDKG, a small manually curated knowledge graph. The results reveal that more elaborated prompts improve the quality of extraction of medical context; 71% of indications had at least one medical context; 63.52% of extracted medical contexts correspond to those identified in NeuroDKG. This paper demonstrates the utility of using large language models for specialized knowledge extraction, with a particular focus on extracting drug indications and their medical context. We provide DIAMOND-KG as a FAIR RDF graph supported with an ontology.

Therefore, the 2024 Semantic Web Challenge on Tabular Data to Knowledge Graph Matching (SemTab) focuses on using metadata, such as column names, to map tables to semantic concepts within standardized vocabularies or Knowledge Graphs (KGs). The challenge involves mapping two datasets, one to the DBpedia ontology and the other to a custom vocabulary. Our approach begins with applying Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for a broad search of relevant matches, ensuring scalability. We then refine these matches using a Large Language Model (LLM) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting and Self-Consistency (SC). Finally, we combine the results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) to obtain a final ranking of the matches. This method achieves hit rates of 62% (top 1) and 82% (top 5) for the first dataset, and 84% (top 1) and 98% (top 5) for the second. The LLM’s strong semantic understanding and extensive knowledge base provide significant advantages over traditional human labeling, which is often laborious and time-consuming. Furthermore, the LLM’s zero-shot capability removes the need for additional task-specific training data, making this solution applicable across various domains. Despite limitations like computational costs and the need for well-defined concepts in the ontology or vocabulary, our approach remains cost-effective compared to extensive human labeling. Moreover, we leave room to trade performance for scalability if needed, pending further research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Linkage; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Metadata; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Zero-shot Learning; Data Consistency; Large Datasets; Metadata; Ontology; Scalability; Semantics; Spatio-temporal Data; Zero-shot Learning; Data Driven Decision; Data Linkage; Graph Matchings; Human Labelling; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Knowledge Graph","Data consistency; Large datasets; Metadata; Ontology; Scalability; Semantics; Spatio-temporal data; Zero-shot learning; Data driven decision; Data linkage; Graph matchings; Human labelling; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Retrieval augmented generation; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214864616"

A human assessment study was conducted which revealed that concepts produced by GPT-4 are preferred over those from logical concept induction systems in terms of human understandability, despite some limitations in neuron activation analysis. Building on these insights, further research aims to automate the concept induction system using LLMs, potentially addressing the shortcomings of traditional logical reasoners.

Many rare diseases do not have specific International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Edition (ICD-9) and Tenth Edition (ICD-10), codes and therefore cannot be reliably extracted from granular fields like “Diagnosis” and “Problem List” entries, which complicates tasks that require identification of patients with these conditions, including clinical trial recruitment and research efforts. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating the extraction of medical information, offering the potential to improve medical research, diagnosis, and management. However, most LLMs lack professional medical knowledge, especially concerning specific rare diseases, and cannot effectively manage rare disease data in its various ontological forms, making it unsuitable for these tasks. Objective: Our aim is to create an end-to-end system called automated rare disease mining (AutoRD), which automates the extraction of rare disease–related information from medical text, focusing on entities and their relations to other medical concepts, such as signs and symptoms. AutoRD integrates up-to-date ontologies with other structured knowledge and demonstrates superior performance in rare disease extraction tasks. We conducted various experiments to evaluate AutoRD’s performance, aiming to surpass common LLMs and traditional methods. Methods: AutoRD is a pipeline system that involves data preprocessing, entity extraction, relation extraction, entity calibration, and knowledge graph construction. We implemented this system using GPT-4 and medical knowledge graphs developed from the open-source Human Phenotype and Orphanet ontologies, using techniques such as chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt engineering. We quantitatively evaluated our system’s performance in entity extraction, relation extraction, and knowledge graph construction. The experiment used the well-curated dataset RareDis2023, which contains medical literature focused on rare disease entities and their relations, making it an ideal dataset for training and testing our methodology. Results: On the RareDis2023 dataset, AutoRD achieved an overall entity extraction F<inf>1</inf>-score of 56.1% and a relation extraction F<inf>1</inf>-score of 38.6%, marking a 14.4% improvement over the baseline LLM. Notably, the F<inf>1</inf>-score for rare disease entity extraction reached 83.5%, indicating high precision and recall in identifying rare disease mentions. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating LLMs with medical ontologies in extracting complex rare disease information. Conclusions: AutoRD is an automated end-to-end system for extracting rare disease information from text to build knowledge graphs, addressing critical limitations of existing LLMs by improving identification of these diseases and connecting them to related clinical features. This work underscores the significant potential of LLMs in transforming health care, particularly in the rare disease domain. By leveraging ontology-enhanced LLMs, AutoRD constructs a robust medical knowledge base that incorporates up-to-date rare disease information, facilitating improved identification of patients and resulting in more inclusive research and trial candidacy efforts. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Clinical Informatics; Data Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Llm; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Ontologies; Rare Disease; Text Mining","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214677383"

This rests on the long history of ontologies and knowledge graphs in constructing human-comprehensible justification for model outputs as well as traceability concerning the impact of evidence on other evidence. Understanding the nature of arguments and argumentation is critical to each, especially when LLM output conflicts with what is expected by users.

Using an efficient approach to classify domain entities enhances data integration, interoperability, and the semantic clarity of ontologies, which are crucial for structured knowledge representation and modeling. Based on this, our main motivation is to help an ontology engineer with an automated approach to classify domain entities into top-level ontology concepts using informal definitions of these domain entities during the ontology development process. In this context, we hypothesize that the informal definitions encapsulate semantic information crucial for associating domain entities with specific top-level ontology concepts. Our approach leverages state-of-the-art language models to explore our hypothesis across multiple languages and informal definitions from different knowledge resources. In order to evaluate our proposal, we extracted multi-label datasets from the alignment of the OntoWordNet ontology and the BabelNet semantic network, covering the entire structure of the Dolce-Lite-Plus top-level ontology from most generic to most specific concepts. These datasets contain several different textual representation approaches of domain entities, including terms, example sentences, and informal definitions. Our experiments conducted 3 study cases, investigating the effectiveness of our proposal across different textual representation approaches, languages, and knowledge resources. We demonstrate that the best results are achieved using a classification pipeline with a K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) method to classify the embedding representation of informal definitions from the Mistral large language model. The findings underscore the potential of informal definitions in reflecting top-level ontology concepts and point towards developing automated tools that could significantly aid ontology engineers during the ontology development process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Informal Definition; Language Model; Ontology Learning; Top-level Ontology Classification; Classification (of Information); Data Encapsulation; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Representation; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Development Process; Domain Entities; Informal Definition; Language Model; Multiple Languages; Ontology Concepts; Ontology Development; Ontology Learning; Ontology's; Top-level Ontology Classification; Semantics","Classification (of information); Data encapsulation; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge representation; Modeling languages; Ontology; Development process; Domain entities; Informal definition; Language model; Multiple languages; Ontology concepts; Ontology development; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Top-level ontology classification; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214572340"

In recent decades tremendous advances in the application of digital technologies increasingly enable significant efficiency, productivity, environmental sustainability and climate change resilience gains across the continuum of agrifood systems, including agricultural processes and the inputs they use, processing, product distribution, purveyance, knowledge and practice. Digital technologies now underpin new methods, practices, and equipment, altering the way we define and manage issues and indicators, meaningful metrics ranging across topics stretching from soil quality and agricultural practices, to food processing, to wholesaling/retailing, and transportation and warehousing logistics. The increasing ubiquity of digital agrifood technologies has brought a substantial expansion in the cybersecurity attack surface, in the range and kinds of cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the magnitude of their potential consequences, which will continue to grow in the foreseeable future. As a step towards reducing the cyber risks to modern agrifood systems, this paper describes work to develop a conceptual model that will underpin a comprehensive agrifood cybersecurity ontology. This ontology would enable much smoother, structured information sharing between the agrifood and cybersecurity communities, and specifically support efficient data and knowledge sharing about cyber threats and defenses for the agrifood industries. This ontology will include systems actors/agents, the types of technologies they use and their prevalence across food systems, the cyber and social vulnerabilities associated with these actors and technologies, known and previously unseen attacks on the technologies, and best practices for preventing, detecting, mitigating and deterring cyber attacks. The approach for building this ontology includes bringing together cybersecurity and agriculture experts, applying Large Language Models, and integrating relevant existing ontologies and other structured vocabularies in the cybersecurity and agricultural spaces. At this point the team has constructed a preliminary conceptual model that can act as an initial guide for developing a formal ontology across digital local-to-global food systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agrifood Systems; Cybersecurity; Ontologies; Energy Security; Fertilizers; Knowledge Acquisition; Ontology; Agri-food System; Agricultural Process; Agrifood; Conceptual Model; Cyber Security; Digital Technologies; Environmental Sustainability; Food System; Human Races; Ontology's; Cyber Attacks","Energy security; Fertilizers; Knowledge acquisition; Ontology; Agri-food system; Agricultural process; Agrifood; Conceptual model; Cyber security; Digital technologies; Environmental sustainability; Food system; Human races; Ontology's; Cyber attacks","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214557424"

Recent research employs pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) for AQG to reduce manual costs, but these models are limited by their dependence on training data. This in turn makes LLMs to conterfeit the answer-revealingness challenge in automatic Multi-hop Question Generation. This challenge occurs in the process of Multi-hop Question Generation as it requires integration of named entities from multiple sources and deep comprehension of these interconnected concepts, which is quite challenging. In this context, Retrieval Augmented Models (RAM) have gained attention in NLP for improving text processing through enhanced information extraction, yet their application in AQG is limited. This research addresses this gap by RAM's workflow with attention to its first phase - Input Text Enrichment via Named Entity Expansion—is crucial for generating diverse, comprehensive questions. But, Effective named entity expansion is facilitated by ontology mapping to align entities to various ontologies, which is more demanding. To address this requirement, SPARQL querying techniques such as multi-querying, step-back querying, and sub-querying are examined to enhance named entity expansion accuracy, thereby improving RAM's efficacy, leading to well-formed auto-generated questions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Question Generation; Named Entity Set Expansion; Ontology Mapping; Retrieval Augmented Model; Semantic Similarity; Ontology; Query Languages; Query Processing; Question Answering; Semantics; Automatic Question Generation; Language Model; Multi-hops; Named Entities; Named Entity Set Expansion; Ontology Mapping; Retrieval Augmented Model; Semantic Similarity; Set Expansions; Text-processing; Structured Query Language","Ontology; Query languages; Query processing; Question answering; Semantics; Automatic question generation; Language model; Multi-hops; Named entities; Named entity set expansion; Ontology mapping; Retrieval augmented model; Semantic similarity; Set expansions; Text-processing; Structured Query Language","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214557306"

Creating ontologies, however, is a complex and time-consuming endeavor. ChEBI is a well-known ontology in the field of chemistry, which provides a comprehensive resource for defining chemical entities and their properties. However, it covers only a small fraction of the rapidly growing knowledge in chemistry and does not provide references to the scientific literature. To address this, we propose a methodology that involves augmenting existing annotated text corpora with knowledge from Chebi and fine-tuning a large language model (LLM) to recognize chemical entities and their roles in scientific text. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. By combining ontological knowledge and the language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we achieve high precision and recall rates in identifying both the chemical entities and roles in scientific literature. Furthermore, we extract them from a set of 8,000 ChemRxiv articles, and apply a second LLM to create a knowledge graph (KG) of chemical entities and roles (CEAR), which provides complementary information to ChEBI, and can help to extend it. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chebi; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Named Entity Recognition; Ontologies; Ontology; Automatic Construction; Chebi; Chemical Entity; Formal Representations; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology's; Scientific Literature; Knowledge Graph","Ontology; Automatic construction; ChEBI; Chemical entity; Formal representations; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Ontology's; Scientific literature; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214555647"

Developing them is a complex and time-consuming task, requiring domain expertise to ensure accuracy and consistency. Ontology learning aims to automate this process by learning full ontologies, or parts of them, from sources such as textual data. In this paper, we research the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4o, in ontology learning, using a real-world use case. We introduce a manually constructed ontology based on knowledge in a news article, and compare it to ontologies extracted using three different prompting approaches over multiple runs. The resulting ontologies are evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively, to ensure that differences in performance due to modelling choices are also considered. The results show that, while the LLM effectively identifies important classes and individuals, it often does not include properties between classes, and adds inconsistent and incorrect properties between individuals. Prompting on a sentence level leads to more correct individuals and properties, however, quantitative evaluation shows more hallucinations and incorrect triples. Despite these issues, LLMs advance previous ontology learning methods by considering classes, individuals, and properties as a whole, creating a more complete ontology rather than isolated elements. This provides a new perspective on ontology learning and highlights the potential of LLMs to offer a first version of an ontology or an extension to an existing one based on new information. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information Extraction; Knowledge Graph Extraction; Large Language Models; Ontology Learning; Adversarial Machine Learning; Federated Learning; Knowledge Graph; Graph Extractions; Information Extraction; Knowledge Graph Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Learning From Texts; Ontology Learning; Ontology's; Property; Contrastive Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Federated learning; Knowledge graph; Graph extractions; Information extraction; Knowledge graph extraction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Learning from texts; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Property; Contrastive Learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214243423"

Current implementations typically involve the LMS requesting services from an AI engine, such as responses, suggestions, and content summaries, reflecting a superficial interaction between two distinct systems. This limited integration arises from the architecture of most major LMS platforms (e.g., Moodle, Docebo, Sakai), which were designed in the early 2000s. These systems are structured around relational databases and multi-layered logic, which separates business logic from the user interface. While they offer extensive multimedia resources for education, their content is generally organized into folders based on modules or lessons, limiting their adaptability to modern AI functionalities. Additionally, while some platforms support text-based interactions (forums, FAQs, blogs), their overall design remains outdated. This paper proposes a new software architecture for LMSs, designed to natively support AI functionalities. It advocates for a shift from relational to graph-based models for content storage, allowing the creation of a knowledge graph that integrates ontological frameworks. This transformation would enable more advanced AI-driven functionalities, such as content recommendations, semantic searches, and personalized learning experiences. We also address the challenges inherent in such a transformation, including a) the need for a complete redesign of the platform's persistence and business logic layers; b) the complexity of integrating multi-domain ontologies within educational institutions; and c) the technological hurdles in training large, adaptive language models that can evolve in real-time, especially during periods of high content generation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graphs; Learning Management Systems; Named-entity Recognition; C (programming Language); Ontology; Relational Database Systems; Semantics; 'current; Creative Commons; Design And Implementations; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Learning Management System; Multi-layered; Named Entity Recognition; Relational Database; System Platforms; Knowledge Graph","C (programming language); Ontology; Relational database systems; Semantics; 'current; Creative Commons; Design and implementations; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Learning management system; Multi-layered; Named entity recognition; Relational Database; System platforms; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214206144"

On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently gained popularity for their ability to understand and generate human-like natural language, offering promising ways to automate aspects of this process. This work explores the (semi-)automatic construction of KGs facilitated by different state-of-the-art LLMs: Mixtral 8x22B Instruct v0.1, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, and Gemini. Our pipeline involves formulating competency questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal to no involvement of human experts. We showcase the feasibility of our semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by exploiting scholarly publications.

In order to answer the performance drawback, this paper introduces a novel pipeline, called CO-ISSC (Core Ontology-based Incremental Semi-Supervised Clustering), for concept formation towards ontology learning. This pipeline uses a PLM (Pre-trained Language Model) and combines in an incremental manner a semi-supervised dimension reduction technique and a clustering technique, guided by core concepts as prior knowledge to align results with the ontology domain. Its incremental nature enhances prior knowledge and boosts its performance. The CO-ISSC pipeline's performance is evaluated on the recent and significant AI Act text established by the European Union, which aims to ensure the safety, transparency, and non-discrimination of AI systems. To this end, we manually built a benchmark terminology for the AI Act domain given that no reference model exists yet. The results demonstrate promising performance of the CO-ISSC pipeline, outperforming baseline non-supervised or semi-supervised approaches such as DBSCAN, similarity measure based approaches, support vector machines and ANN. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Act Domain; Clustering; Concept Formation; Dimension Reduction; Incremental Pipeline; Ontology Learning; Prior Knowledge; Adversarial Machine Learning; Contrastive Learning; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Self-supervised Learning; Semi-supervised Learning; Ai Act Domain; Clusterings; Concept Formation; Dimension Reduction; Incremental Pipeline; Ontology Learning; Ontology-based; Performance; Prior-knowledge; Semi-supervised; Support Vector Machines","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Self-supervised learning; Semi-supervised learning; AI act domain; Clusterings; Concept formation; Dimension reduction; Incremental pipeline; Ontology learning; Ontology-based; Performance; Prior-knowledge; Semi-supervised; Support vector machines","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213329685"

Automating the alignment process thus becomes a must-do, especially when involving large datasets, to at least produce a first input for human experts. Automated ontology alignment could benefit from the outstanding language ability of Large Language Models (LLMs), which could implicitly provide the background knowledge that has been the Achilles' heel of traditional alignment systems. However, this requires a correct evaluation of the performance of LLMs and understanding the best way to incorporate them into more specific tools. In this paper, we show that a naive prompting approach on the popular GPT-4 model could face several problems when transferred to real-world use cases. To this end, we replicated the methods of Norouzi et al. (2023), applied to the OAEI 2022 conference track, on a reference alignment between a pair of datasets (reduced versions of two popular thesauri: European Commission's EuroVoc and TESEO, from the Italian Senate of the Republic), which has never been tested in OAEI evaluation campaigns. This reference alignment has several features common to real-world use cases: it is has a larger size than those considered in the study we replicated, it is not published online and is therefore not subject to data contamination and it involves relations between concepts that are more complex than simple equivalence. The replicated methods achieved a significantly lower performance on our reference alignment than on the OAEI 2022 conference track, suggesting that size, data contamination, and semantic complexity need to be considered when using LLMs for the alignment task. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Ontology Alignment; Semantic Technologies; Latent Semantic Analysis; Ontology; Error Prone Tasks; Human Expert; Language Model; Large Datasets; Large Language Model; Ontology Alignment; Performance; Real-world; Semantic Technologies; Semantic-web; Semantics","Latent semantic analysis; Ontology; Error prone tasks; Human expert; Language model; Large datasets; Large language model; Ontology alignment; Performance; Real-world; Semantic technologies; Semantic-Web; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213321670"

Annotating plasmid-encoded proteins with the widely used Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary is a fundamental step in various tasks, including plasmid mobility classification. However, GO prediction for plasmid-encoded proteins faces 2 major challenges: the high diversity of functions and the limited availability of high-quality GO annotations. Results: In this study, we introduce PlasGO, a tool that leverages a hierarchical architecture to predict GO terms for plasmid proteins. PlasGO utilizes a powerful protein language model to learn the local context within protein sentences and a BERT model to capture the global context within plasmid sentences. Additionally, PlasGO allows users to control the precision by incorporating a self-attention confidence weighting mechanism. We rigorously evaluated PlasGO and benchmarked it against 7 state-of-the-art tools in a series of experiments. The experimental results collectively demonstrate that PlasGO has achieved commendable performance. PlasGO significantly expanded the annotations of the plasmid-encoded protein database by assigning high-confidence GO terms to over 95% of previously unannotated proteins, showcasing impressive precision of 0.8229, 0.7941, and 0.8870 for the 3 GO categories, respectively, as measured on the novel protein test set. Conclusions: PlasGO, a hierarchical tool incorporating protein language models and BERT, significantly expanded plasmid protein annotations by predicting high-confidence GO terms. These annotations have been compiled into a database, which will serve as a valuable contribution to downstream plasmid analysis and research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Go Term Prediction; Plasmid Protein Function; Protein Language Model; Bacterial Proteins; Antibiotic Resistance; Article; Gene Ontology; Gene Structure; Human; Microbial Community; Mobile Genetic Element; Plasmid; Prediction; Protein Database; Protein Function; Protein Language Model; Bioinformatics; Genetics; Metabolism; Molecular Genetics; Procedures; Software; Bacterial Protein; Bacterial Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Plasmids; Software","antibiotic resistance; article; gene ontology; gene structure; human; microbial community; mobile genetic element; plasmid; prediction; protein database; protein function; protein language model; bioinformatics; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; procedures; software; bacterial protein; Bacterial Proteins; Computational Biology; Databases, Protein; Gene Ontology; Molecular Sequence Annotation; Plasmids; Software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212964338"

In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enrich ontologies by identifying and asserting class disjointness axioms. Our approach aims at leveraging the implicit knowledge embedded in LLMs, using prompt engineering to elicit this knowledge for classifying ontological disjointness. We validate our methodology on the DBpedia ontology, focusing on open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs, when guided by effective prompt strategies, can reliably identify disjoint class relationships, thus streamlining the process of ontology completion without extensive manual input. For comprehensive disjointness enrichment, we propose a process that takes logical relationships between disjointness and subclass statements into account in order to maintain satisfiability and reduce the number of calls to the LLM. This work provides a foundation for future applications of LLMs in automated ontology enhancement and offers insights into optimizing LLM performance through strategic prompt design.

Our approach uses LLMs to automatically recognize entities and relations between them and resolve conflicts between these values. To prevent hallucination, the interaction with the LLM is grounded in a simple ontology with four types of entities and seven types of relations. To evaluate our architecture, we use a gold standard graph constructed using a small subset of the documents, and compare this to the graph obtained from our approach when processing the same set of documents. Results show that the automatic construction manages to recognize a good portion of all the entities in the gold standard and that those not recognized are explained mainly by the level of granularity in which the information is structured in the graph and not because the automatic approach misses an important entity in the graph. Looking forward, we expect this report to encourage work on other similar projects focused on enhancing research in humanities and social science. However, we remark that better evaluation metrics are needed to accurately fine-tune these types of architectures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","History; Ontology; Automatic Approaches; Automatic Construction; Case-studies; Gold Standards; Historical Documents; Humanities And Social Science; Knowledge Graphs; Ontology's; Simple++; Types Of Relations; Knowledge Graph","History; Ontology; Automatic approaches; Automatic construction; Case-studies; Gold standards; Historical documents; Humanities and social science; Knowledge graphs; Ontology's; Simple++; Types of relations; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212705684"

In this work, the function-calling possibility of LLMs is explored to search for already defined entities in the KG and add information in the form of triples to the KG. A huge improvement over previous techniques is that it can also deal with various large ontologies/KGs and that the added information fits to a provided KG on a schema and instance level.

Translating ontology axioms into natural language can significantly aid in ontology evaluation by making the content more understandable to subject matter experts who may lack a background in knowledge engineering. In this preliminary study, we investigate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in axiom translation from ontologies to facilitate ontology evaluation. We utilize Llama 3 to translate 1,192 ontology axioms across 19 distinct axiom types from five published ontologies. Results show that 163 (13.67%) of the Llama 3 translation of the axiom are accurately represented, 268 (22.48%) are not accurately represented, and 761 (63.84%) are partially accurate. Our manual evaluation of the Llama 3 translation indicates some competency in producing hierarchical natural language equivalents while revealing some limitations when translating complex axioms. Nonetheless, there are opportunities to improve the results with few-shot training or using LLMs to provide support in knowledge engineering for ontologies. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ontology; Translation (languages); Domain Experts; Language Model; Natural Languages; Ontological Elements; Ontology Axioms; Ontology Development; Ontology Evaluations; Ontology's; Subject Matter Experts; Top Down Approaches; Knowledge Engineering","Ontology; Translation (languages); Domain experts; Language model; Natural languages; Ontological elements; Ontology axioms; Ontology development; Ontology evaluations; Ontology's; Subject matter experts; Top down approaches; Knowledge engineering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212688634"

The different components of the R-IO SUITE platform are used to climb the four abstraction layers: data, information, decision and action through interpretation (from data to information), exploitation (from information to decision) and implementation (from decision to action). These transitions between layers are supported by a knowledge base embedding knowledge instances structured according to a crisis management metamodel. From a functional perspective, this platform is fully operational, however, to be able to cover any type of crisis situation, the knowledge base should be enriched, first, from a “resource perspective” (to embed the various available means to deal with any faced situation), and second, from an “issue perspective” (to understand all risks and damage that can appear on a crisis situation). It is not reasonable to consider creating and maintaining such an exhaustive knowledge base. However, the connection of the R-IO SUITE platform with LLM software such as ChatGPT© makes it possible, by generating appropriate prompts, to update on-the-fly the knowledge base according to the faced context. This article shows how the LLM AI can provide complementary knowledge to formally fulfil the knowledge base to make it relevant to the faced crisis situation.

In recent years, most methods have relied on pre-trained language models such as BERT and Roberta to learn semantic representations from the context. However, in texts with ambiguous sentiment expression, the absence of domain knowledge guidance may lead pre-trained language models to miss critical information, and the attention mechanism might incorrectly focus on text that is irrelevant to the aspect categories. To address these issues, this study integrates the ontology of movie reviews to construct an aspect-based sentiment analysis model based on the ERNIE(OMR-EBA). We annotated a new Chinese data set focused on movie reviews to evaluate the model’s performance. Experimental results show that our model achieves 86% accuracy in aspectual sentiment analysis, which is better than other baseline models.

Acknowledging the challenges inherent in directly applying RAG, our approach begins with the development of a specialised ontology framework for NDC reports. This framework supports the construction of a knowledge graph that provides essential, verifiable information for a Question Answering (QA) model. In the next step, the model combines RAG embeddings with ontology-based queries, aiming to enhance the reliability of answers across various NDC reports. We evaluate the performance of our hybrid model through testing with a set of questions and human/AI evaluation across different LLMs. While the results indicate improvements in the efficiency of climate change-related QA models, they also underscore the complexity of achieving significant enhancements in this domain.

It has become clear to the research community that in order to produce reliably correct answers, LLMs need to be enriched in some way with ‘world models’ reflecting the semantics of the domains being queried. We here propose a simple workflow to address this problem through a neuro-symbolic interaction protocol with the LLM treated as a blackbox.

This intricate process can be conceptualized as a hierarchical tree structure, wherein facts are aggregated in a bottom-up manner to highlight pivotal facts. These critical facts are subsequently linked to legal norms, facilitating the derivation of specific decisions. Despite the intrinsic value of this information, there is no legal knowledge graph(KG) that can represent this, and even if there were, the task of text-mining or text-annotation of such legal structures from court judgments presents considerable challenges. We show a legal ontology that links facts and norms and a new collaborative framework that harnesses the capabilities of both LLMs and legal experts for extracting these intricate relationships. Our approach is underpinned by a carefully designed LLM, tailored through prompt engineering, that can capture such structures. The results from this are then refined by legal experts through a graphic user interface, also providing us with an overall score of the annotation.

And what of “the human,” that oft taken-for-granted concept within which lies a whole nest of ontological justifications that have, in many ways, ushered us into the Anthropocene? In this chapter I address these questions through close critical engagement with the discourses of AI chatbots, of which ChatGPT is only the most famous. This analysis demonstrates the need for a new rhetorical paradigm that can account for the rise of agential machines, emergent technocracies, and the translative rhetorical force of technoscience, which instead of foreclosing spaces for rhetoric to thrive are in fact opening up whole new realms of rhetorical action, the likes of which we’ve never seen.

This work investigates the neural sub-structures within LLMs that manifest CoT reasoning from a mechanistic point of view. From an analysis of Llama-2 7B applied to multistep reasoning over fictional ontologies, we demonstrate that LLMs deploy multiple parallel pathways of answer generation for step-by-step reasoning. These parallel pathways provide sequential answers from the input question context as well as the generated CoT. We observe a functional rift in the middle layers of the LLM. Token representations in the initial half remain strongly biased towards the pretraining prior, with the in-context prior taking over in the later half. This internal phase shift mani-fests in different functional components: attention heads that write the answer token appear in the later half, attention heads that move information along ontological relationships appear in the initial half, and so on. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt towards mechanistic investigation of CoT reasoning in LLMs. The source code and data are made available at https://github.com/joykirat18/How-To-Think-Step-by-Step. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209773373"

The objective is to create structured, machine-readable knowledge graphs (KGs) from unstructured texts for better exploration and linkage to external resources. The research introduces a methodology that combines large language models (LLMs) with traditional relation extraction (RE) algorithms to overcome the limitations of current models with Italian literary documents. The process adopts a multilingual LLM, that is, ChatGPT, to extract natural language triples from the text. These are then converted into RDF/XML format using the REBEL model, which maps natural language relations to Wikidata properties. A similarity-based filtering mechanism using SBERT is applied to keep semantic consistency. The final RDF graph integrates these filtered triples with document metadata, utilizing established ontologies and controlled vocabularies. The research uses a dataset of 41 TEI/XML files from a semi-diplomatic edition of Leopardi's letters as case study. The proposed KE pipeline significantly outperformed the baseline model, that is, mREBEL, with remarkable improvements in semantic accuracy and consistency. An ablation study demonstrated that combining LLMs with traditional RE models enhances the quality of KGs extracted from complex texts. The resulting KG had fewer, but semantically richer, relations, predominantly related to Leopardi's literary activities and health, highlighting the extracted knowledge's relevance to understanding his life and work. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entity Linking; Giacomo Leopardi; Knowledge Extraction; Large Language Models (llms); Relation Extraction; Semantic Web; Tei/xml; Wikidata","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209410230"

This approach was tested through a series of experiments aimed at generating natural language phrases from their underlying ontological representations. These representations were automatically derived from sentences in scientific and technical texts using advanced software tools. They encapsulate the entities identified in the text and the semantic relationships between them, which can be expressed in the sentences of the analyzed text. In more detail, the system identifies relationships between concepts and links them to entities within a sentence. These entities can be either simple sentences or parts of complex ones. The structured prompt provided to the language model includes detailed explanations of these semantic relationships and a set of concept pairs connected by these relationships, serving as the building blocks for sentence creation. The generated sentences were then compared to the original ones using the cosine similarity measure across various vectorization methods. The similarity scores, calculated using the xx_ent_wiki_sm model, ranged from 0.8193 to 0.9722. Despite these high similarity scores, some stylistic differences were noted in the generated sentences.

Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7% on a self-built TFCQD test set, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of folklore domain question answering. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Question Answering; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Traditional Folklore; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; 'current; Intangible Cultural Heritages; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Natural Language Understanding; Ontology's; Question Answering; Retrieval-augmented Generation; Traditional Folklore; Question Answering","Domain Knowledge; Knowledge graph; 'current; Intangible cultural heritages; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Natural language understanding; Ontology's; Question Answering; Retrieval-augmented generation; Traditional folklore; Question answering","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85209217304"

This chapter explores the transformative potential of combining large language models (LLMs) with context-aware emotion and fatigue recognition techniques in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). The primary objective is to enhance driving experiences and overall well-being through real-time emotional and fatigue assessments. Grounded in Active and Assisted Living (AAL) principles, this chapter emphasizes the practical implementation of bio-signal-based emotion and fatigue estimation techniques within the ADAS framework. Utilizing formal knowledge representation techniques, such as ontologies, demonstrates how contextual modeling can facilitate optimal support services in dynamic driving contexts. Central to this approach is the integration of LLMs with emotion and fatigue recognition methodologies. The chapter details using non-intrusive bio-signal sensors to analyze facial expressions through video, EEG measurements, and voice analysis. This synergy between language comprehension and bio-signal insights enables real-time emotional assessments and fatigue estimations, empowering safer and more responsive driving experiences. LLMs act as the cognitive bridge, enhancing human driver assistance with context-aware emotion and fatigue recognition. The chapter reveals the potential of language models to decode emotional cues and detect fatigue levels, which are crucial for shaping proactive and adaptive driver assistance strategies. Integrating LLMs within ADAS showcases their ability to anticipate driver needs, provide timely alerts, and improve decision-making processes. Importantly, this chapter offers a roadmap for integrating LLMs with context-aware emotion and fatigue recognition into ADAS. Leveraging the capabilities of LLMs presents a scalable method for embedding bio-signal-based emotion and fatigue estimation techniques into ADAS, highlighting the AAL principles while demonstrating the transformative potential of LLMs. This work envisions an advanced iteration of ADAS, fostering a safer, more intuitive, and supportive driving experience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (adas); Bio-signal Processing; Context-aware Systems; Emotion And Fatigue Detection; Human-centered Design; Large Language Models (llms); Real-time Assessments","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208981614"

Monitoring and maintaining the FCS under dynamic and complex conditions rely heavily on empirical expert knowledge. Domain Knowledge Graphs (KG) serve as an efficient mechanism for FCS status management within expert systems, enabling effective value extraction. This paper outlines the construction of an FCS KG through large language model (LLM) fine-tuning, enriched with aeronautical domain knowledge derived from multi-source heterogeneous FCS texts. The process begins with the creation of an FCS ontology, integrating aeronautical domain knowledge and defining entity-relationship types. Subsequently, the Llama3-8B LLM was fine-tuned using methods such as LoRA, QLoRA, and AdaLoRA for parameter-efficient tuning, and prior aeronautical knowledge was incorporated via a chain of thought (COT) prompt template to facilitate intelligent discovery from a common FCS dataset. Experimental results indicate that the aeronautical domain knowledgeaugmented LLM method achieved an F1 score of 97.86%, representing a 6.48% improvement over traditional methods. Finally, the FCS KG was visualized using the graph database Neo4j, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of this approach in constructing FCS KG. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Flight Control System (fcs), Knowledge Graph (kg); Knowledge Discovery (kd); Large Language Model (llm); Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning (peft); Domain Knowledge; Fine Tuning; Flight Control System , Knowledge Graph; Flight-control Systems; Knowledge Discovery; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning; System Knowledge; Knowledge Graph","Domain knowledge; Fine tuning; Flight control system , knowledge graph; Flight-control systems; Knowledge discovery; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Parameter-efficient fine-tuning; System knowledge; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208787293"

However, in most of the existing design courses, students often work in small groups and peer interactions are limited to group members, which limits the range and depth of knowledge exchange. To complement the group-based activities, this study designs and assesses an analytics-enhanced discussion forum for whole-class interactions. The forum adopts ontology-based recommender systems and anomaly detection techniques to tailor the threads and contents for individual students in a personalized way. This analytics-enhanced forum was implemented in a large-size undergraduate design course (n = 313), and data about student responses to this forum was compared with data from the previous year's course that adopted a conventional forum (n = 280). From the statistical analysis, students learning with the analytics-enhanced forum demonstrated significantly higher degrees of design practices (specifically, empathize, define, ideate, and test), collaborative learning, and course satisfaction. Qualitative analysis of students' focus-group interviews shows their perceived benefits and concerns of the analytics-enhanced forum.

As textual clinical reports are the richest source of phenotypes information, their automatic extraction is a critical task. The main challenges of this Information Extraction (IE) task are to identify precisely the text spans related to a phenotype and to link them unequivocally to referenced entities from a source such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Recently, Language Models (LMs) have been the most suc-cessful approach for extracting phenotypes from clinical reports. Solutions such as PhenoBERT, relying on BERT or GPT, have shown promising results when applied to datasets built on the hypothesis that most phenotypes are explicitly mentioned in the text. However, this assumption is not always true in medical genetics. Hence, although the LMs carry powerful semantic abilities, their contributions are not clear compared to syntactic string-matching steps that are used within the current pipelines. The goal of this study is to improve phenotype extraction from clinical notes related to genetic diseases. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a clear definition of the phenotype extraction task from free text, along with a high-level overview of the involved functions. Second, we conduct an in-depth analysis of PhenoBERT, one of the best existing solutions, to evaluate the proportion of phenotypes predicted with simple string-matching. Third, we demonstrate how utilizing and incorporating large language models (LLMs) for span detection step can improve performance especially with implicit phenotypes. In addition, this experiment revealed that the annotations of existing dataset are not exhaustive, and that LLM can identify relevant spans missed by human labelers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Embed Dings; Entity Linking; Genetic; Llm; Phenobert; Phenotype; Embed Ding; Entity Linking; Genetic; Language Model; Large Language Model; Phenobert; Phenotype; Phenotyping; String Matching; Text Analysis; Semantics","Embed ding; Entity linking; Genetic; Language model; Large language model; Phenobert; Phenotype; Phenotyping; String matching; Text analysis; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208419027"

We introduce a novel approach for assurance of the adversarial robustness of LLMs based on formal argumentation. Using ontologies for formalization, we structure state-of-the-art attacks and defenses, facilitating the creation of a human-readable assurance case, and a machine-readable representation.

However, modeling such complex ontological descriptions is still a manual and error-prone task that requires a significant amount of effort and ontology expertise. This contribution presents an innovative method to automate capability ontology modeling using Large Language Models (LLMs), which have proven to be well suited for such tasks. Our approach requires only a natural language description of a capability, which is then automatically inserted into a predefined prompt using a few-shot prompting technique. After prompting an LLM, the resulting capability ontology is automatically verified through various steps in a loop with the LLM to check the overall correctness of the capability ontology. First, a syntax check is performed, then a check for contradictions, and finally a check for hallucinations and missing ontology elements. Our method greatly reduces manual effort, as only the initial natural language description and a final human review and possible correction are necessary, thereby streamlining the capability ontology generation process. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Capabilities; Large Language Models; Llms; Model-generation; Ontologies; Semantic Web; Skills; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Capability; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model Generation; Natural Languages; Ontology's; Semantic-web; Skill; Modeling Languages","Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Capability; Language model; Large language model; Model generation; Natural languages; Ontology's; Semantic-Web; Skill; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207822437"

Knowledge engineering, like compiling companies' vast bodies of knowledge into these structures, however, still represents a time-consuming, largely manually performed process, esp. with significant amounts of knowledge often only recorded within unstructured text documents. Since the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on text summarization, this raises the question whether these could be exploited within dedicated knowledge fusion architectures to assist human knowledge engineers by automatically suggesting relevant classes, instances and relations extracted from textual corpora. We therefore propose a novel approach that leverages the taxonomic structure of a partially defined ontology to prompt LLMs for hierarchical knowledge organization. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on static ontologies, our methodology dynamically generates prompts based on the ontology's existing class taxonomy, prompting the LLM to generate responses that extract supplementary information from unstructured documents. It thus introduces the concept of using ontologies as scaffolds for guiding LLMs, in order to realize a mutual interplay between structured ontological knowledge and the soft fusion capabilities of LLMs. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on a real-world case study, performing a knowledge fusion task on heterogeneous technical documentation from a medical prosthesis manufacturer. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Engineering; Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Ontology Population; Soft Fusion; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Prosthetics; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Case-studies; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Medical Prosthesis; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Ontology Population; Ontology's; Soft Fusions; Taxonomies","Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Prosthetics; Scaffolds; Scaffolds (biology); Case-studies; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Medical prosthesis; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology Population; Ontology's; Soft fusions; Taxonomies","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207690564"

Integrating biomedical knowledge sources such as SNOMED CT into LLMs may enhance their performance on biomedical tasks. However, the methodologies and effectiveness of incorporating SNOMED CT into LLMs have not been systematically reviewed. Objective: This scoping review aims to examine how SNOMED CT is integrated into LLMs, focusing on (1) the types and components of LLMs being integrated with SNOMED CT, (2) which contents of SNOMED CT are being integrated, and (3) whether this integration improves LLM performance on NLP tasks. Methods: Following the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines, we searched ACM Digital Library, ACL Anthology, IEEE Xplore, PubMed, and Embase for relevant studies published from 2018 to 2023. Studies were included if they incorporated SNOMED CT into LLM pipelines for natural language understanding or generation tasks. Data on LLM types, SNOMED CT integration methods, end tasks, and performance metrics were extracted and synthesized. Results: The review included 37 studies. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers and its biomedical variants were the most commonly used LLMs. Three main approaches for integrating SNOMED CT were identified: (1) incorporating SNOMED CT into LLM inputs (28/37, 76%), primarily using concept descriptions to expand training corpora; (2) integrating SNOMED CT into additional fusion modules (5/37, 14%); and (3) using SNOMED CT as an external knowledge retriever during inference (5/37, 14%). The most frequent end task was medical concept normalization (15/37, 41%), followed by entity extraction or typing and classification. While most studies (17/19, 89%) reported performance improvements after SNOMED CT integration, only a small fraction (19/37, 51%) provided direct comparisons. The reported gains varied widely across different metrics and tasks, ranging from 0.87% to 131.66%. However, some studies showed either no improvement or a decline in certain performance metrics. Conclusions: This review demonstrates diverse approaches for integrating SNOMED CT into LLMs, with a focus on using concept descriptions to enhance biomedical language understanding and generation. While the results suggest potential benefits of SNOMED CT integration, the lack of standardized evaluation methods and comprehensive performance reporting hinders definitive conclusions about its effectiveness. Future research should prioritize consistent reporting of performance comparisons and explore more sophisticated methods for incorporating SNOMED CT’s relational structure into LLMs. In addition, the biomedical NLP community should develop standardized evaluation frameworks to better assess the impact of ontology integration on LLM performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207323832"

Our presented methodology analyzes the proximity of technological terms related to LLMs, leveraging the OpenAlex and arXiv databases, and focuses on extracting nouns from scientific papers to provide a nuanced portrayal of advancements in LLM technologies. The approach aims to counteract the inherent lags in data, accommodate semantic drift, and distinctly differentiate between various topics, offering both retrospective and prospective insights in their analytical purview. The insights derived underline the need for refined, robust, adaptable, and precise forecasting models as LLMs intersect with domains like cyber defense.

They help scientists navigate the vast landscape of research literature and are essential for building intelligent systems such as smart search engines, recommendation systems, conversational agents, and advanced analytics tools. However, the manual creation of these KOSs is costly, time-consuming, and often leads to outdated and overly broad representations. As a result, researchers have been exploring automated or semi-automated methods for generating ontologies of research topics. This paper analyses the use of large language models (LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between research topics. We specifically focus on six open and lightweight LLMs (up to 10.7 billion parameters) and use two zero-shot reasoning strategies to identify four types of relationships: broader, narrower, same-as, and other. Our preliminary analysis indicates that Dolphin2.1-OpenOrca-7B performs strongly in this task, achieving a 0.853 F1-score against a gold standard of 1,000 relationships derived from the IEEE Thesaurus.

In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically extend an existing ontology from streaming data in a zero-shot manner.

Focusing on the medical field, this approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) for two key tasks: Symptom Typing and Symptom Taxonomy among breast and bladder cancer survivors. Symptom Typing involves identifying and classifying medical symptoms from unstructured online patient forum data, while Symptom Taxonomy organizes and integrates these symptoms into an existing ontology. The combined use of online and hierarchical clustering enables real-time and structured categorization and integration of symptoms. The dual-phase model employs multiple LLMs to ensure accurate classification and seamless integration of new symptoms with minimal human oversight.

Protein databases such as SWISS-PROT include curated information on only 570,000 protein sequences, representing a fraction of the 250 million known evidential and predicted sequences; it becomes crucial to cluster proteins into similar groups. This research explores the application of two transformer architectures, BERT and RoBERTa in clustering proteins in the supervised prediction of Gene Ontology (GO) annotations. The detailed methodology for both the pre-training and fine-tuning processes, as well as results that showcase RoBERTa outperforming BERT in the context of protein clustering, on performance metrics of accuracy and loss. Operating under constrained computational resources, the deployed model exhibits strong performance and highlight the robustness of methodology in protein clustering within resource constraints.

Recently, the focus has moved towards semi-supervised methods which concentrate on utilizing unlabeled data, and self-supervised methods which learn the intermediate representation through pretext tasks or contrastive learning. However, both approaches require a vast amount of unlabelled data to improve performance. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Environmental Sound Classification with Hierarchical Ontology-guided semi-supervised Learning (ECHO) that utilizes label ontology-based hierarchy to learn semantic representation by defining a novel pretext task. The model tries to predict coarse labels represented by the Large Language Model (LLM) based on ground truth label ontology, then further fine-tuned in a supervised way to predict the actual task.

However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-Plan-Analyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Database Systems; Document Sets; Downstream Applications; Extraction Modeling; Extraction Ontologies; Infilling; Language Model; Model Agents; On-the-fly; Structured Knowledge; Target Database; Computational Linguistics","Database systems; Document sets; Downstream applications; Extraction modeling; Extraction ontologies; Infilling; Language model; Model agents; On-the-fly; Structured knowledge; Target database; Computational linguistics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205299812"

Despite their encouraging results in various reasoning tasks, these systems often operate as “black boxes”, raising concerns about potential illegal behavior due to opaque decision-making processes. This concern is particularly critical in autonomous driving, where precise decision-making requires a thorough understanding of traffic scenes and strict adherence to established norms. In this paper, we propose a legally-guided automated decision making system (LAD) that employs language models to dynamically retrieve facts for related rules through context-based query generation while delegating decision-making to a symbolic solver. In our experiments, we demonstrate that this neuro-symbolic system, with a limited number of formalized traffic rules, provides a more accurate, interpretable, and traceable solution for rule-compliant decision-making compared to pure language models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Driving; Large Language Model Agent; Neurosymbolic System; Ontological Reasoning; Rule Compliance; Crime; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Query Languages; Structured Query Language; Agent-based Systems; Automated Decision Making Systems; Autonomous Driving; Decisions Makings; Language Model; Large Language Model Agent; Model Agents; Neuro-symbolic System; Ontological Reasoning; Rule Compliance","Crime; Modeling languages; Ontology; Query languages; Structured Query Language; Agent-based systems; Automated decision making systems; Autonomous driving; Decisions makings; Language model; Large language model agent; Model agents; Neuro-symbolic system; Ontological reasoning; Rule compliance","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205093338"

However, distant supervision (DS) is often limited by coarse annotations and insufficient contextual awareness, leading to relational ambiguity and introducing noise in the labeled results. Moreover, although one can optimize the classifiers in DS-RE models through weight updates, the static nature of the guiding rules for such adjustments often falls short when addressing the challenges posed by diverse non-taxonomic relations and complex noise patterns in datasets. In this paper, we propose a DS-RE framework that capitalizes on non-taxonomic relations and a self-optimizing mechanism. We define a set of consistent DS relation candidates and combine DS with a LLM to enhance the perception of entities' contextual states during the DS process. Then, we design a Self-Optimizing Ontology-Enhanced Non-taxonomic Relation Extraction Model (SO-NRE). The model incorporates additional entity-relation knowledge to enhance the semantic depth of Non-taxonomic relation ontologies and uses an adaptive dynamic scheduling mechanism to refine the classification strategy through iterations informed by self-perception outcomes. The experimental results show that the improved DS annotation workflow has enhanced accuracy, and SO-NRE outperforms mainstream baselines in RE performance. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction; Llm; Non-taxonomic Relation; Self-optimization; Ontology; Self-supervised Learning; Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction; Extraction Modeling; Labeled Data; Llm; Non-taxonomic Relation; Ontology's; Relation Extraction; Self-optimization; Self-optimizing; Weight Update; Semantics","Ontology; Self-supervised learning; Distantly supervised relation extraction; Extraction modeling; Labeled data; LLM; Non-taxonomic relation; Ontology's; Relation extraction; Self-optimization; Self-optimizing; Weight update; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85205022179"

Most existing methods for few-shot ED use event ontology and related knowledge to construct prototypes and fail to fully leverage the rich knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs) which could help improve the representation of prototypes. Motivated by this, we propose an prompt-enhanced prototype framework which combines prototype and prompt for few-shot ED. Considering the scarcity of labeled data, we also introduce contrastive learning to enrich prototypes. Specifically, we use heuristic rules to align FrameNet with annotated data to get corresponding prompts for each event and convert them into prompt prototype. We then leverage contrastive learning to aggregate event mentions into prototypes and maintain these prototypes for few-shot ED.

One significant advancement is the development of pre-training protein language models through self-supervised learning from massive protein sequences. These pre-trained models encode various information about protein sequences, evolution, structures, and even functions, which can be easily transferred to various downstream tasks and demonstrate robust generalization capabilities. Recently, researchers have further developed multimodal pre-trained models that integrate more diverse types of data. The recent studies in this direction are summarized and reviewed from the following aspects in this paper. Firstly, the protein pre-training models that integrate protein structures into language models are reviewed: this is particularly important, for protein structure is the primary determinant of its function. Secondly, the pretrained models that integrate protein dynamic information are introduced. These models may benefit downstream tasks such as protein-protein interactions, soft docking of ligands, and interactions involving allosteric proteins and intrinsic disordered proteins. Thirdly, the pre-trained models that integrate knowledge such as gene ontology are described. Fourthly, we briefly introduce pre-trained models in RNA fields.

In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage system for information extraction where we annotate biomedical articles based on a specific ontology (HOIP). The major challenge is annotating relation between biomedical processes often not explicitly mentioned in text articles. Here, we first predict the candidate processes and then determine the relationships between these processes without relying on mentions. The experimental results show promising outcomes in mention-agnostic process identification using Large Language Models (LLMs).

Our method enables LLMs to comprehend KG inputs and infer with a combination of implicit and external knowledge. Moreover, our method elicits the mind map of LLMs, which reveals their reasoning pathways based on the ontology of knowledge. We evaluate our method on diverse question & answering tasks, especially in medical domains, and show significant improvements over baselines.

These approaches yield sporadic successes, yet generally fall short of expectations. In this work, we aim to improve zero-shot event detection by training models to better follow event definitions. We hypothesize that a diverse set of event types and definitions are the key for models to learn to follow event definitions while existing event extraction datasets focus on annotating many high-quality examples for a few event types. To verify our hypothesis, we construct an automatically generated Diverse Event Definition (DivED) dataset and conduct comparative studies. Our experiments reveal that a large number of event types (200) and diverse event definitions can significantly boost event extraction performance; on the other hand, the performance does not scale with over ten examples per event type.

Multiple terms can refer to the same core concepts which can be referred as a clinical entity. Ontologies like the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) are developed and maintained to store millions of clinical entities including the definitions, relations and other corresponding information. These ontologies are used for standardization of clinical text by normalizing varying surface forms of a clinical term through Biomedical entity linking. With the introduction of transformer-based language models, there has been significant progress in Biomedical entity linking. In this work, we focus on learning through synonym pairs associated with the entities. As compared to the existing approaches, our approach significantly reduces the training data and resource consumption. Moreover, we propose a suite of context-based and context-less reranking techniques for performing the entity disambiguation. Overall, we achieve similar performance to the state-of-the-art zero-shot and distant supervised entity linking techniques on the Medmentions dataset, the largest annotated dataset on UMLS, without any domain-based training.

We employ an approach which combines ontology-guided triplet extraction and in-context learning. By using only 20 semantically similar examples with the Llama-3-70B-Instruct model, we achieve performance comparable to previous methods that relied on fine-tuning techniques like SpERT and REBEL.

Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities in various tasks, they still suffer from poor performances compared to most supervised fine-tuned RE methods. Utilizing ICL for RE with LLMs encounters two challenges: (1) retrieving good demonstrations from training examples, and (2) enabling LLMs exhibit strong ICL abilities in RE. On the one hand, retrieving good demonstrations is a non-trivial process in RE, which easily results in low relevance regarding entities and relations. On the other hand, ICL with an LLM achieves poor performance in RE while RE is different from language modeling in nature or the LLM is not large enough. In this work, we propose a novel recall-retrieve-reason RE framework that synergizes LLMs with retrieval corpora (training examples) to enable relevant retrieving and reliable in-context reasoning. Specifically, we distill the consistently ontological knowledge from training datasets to let LLMs generate relevant entity pairs grounded by retrieval corpora as valid queries. These entity pairs are then used to retrieve relevant training examples from the retrieval corpora as demonstrations for LLMs to conduct better ICL via instruction tuning. Extensive experiments on different LLMs and RE datasets demonstrate that our method generates relevant and valid entity pairs and boosts ICL abilities of LLMs, achieving competitive or new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level RE compared to previous supervised fine-tuning methods and ICL-based methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Modeling Languages; Problem Oriented Languages; Self-supervised Learning; Structured Query Language; Supervised Learning; Context Learning; Context Reasoning; Extraction Method; In Contexts; Language Model; Learning Abilities; Non-trivial; Poor Performance; Relation Extraction; Training Example; Demonstrations","Modeling languages; Problem oriented languages; Self-supervised learning; Structured Query Language; Supervised learning; Context learning; Context reasoning; Extraction method; In contexts; Language model; Learning abilities; Non-trivial; Poor performance; Relation extraction; Training example; Demonstrations","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204281542"

Notably, these inquiries may extend beyond mere questions to encompass action commands articulated by the user, which the robot proficiently recognizes and executes. The integration of a Large Language Model enhances the system's capabilities, particularly in the domain of questionanswering. To bolster the recognition and execution of action commands, we have employed a robot action ontology established in previous research endeavors. This ontology defines relevant classes and individuals, forming the basis for a nuanced understanding of user-inputted action commands. Further refinement involves the generation of succinct three-word strings for each action, ensuring semantic alignment with the user's verbal instructions. Importantly, our system operates in two distinctive modes: STATELESS and STATEFUL. In STATEFUL mode, the robot possesses awareness of its present posture, allowing it to execute action commands only when they align with its current state.

While existing research has primarily explored the utilisation of LLMs for constructing and completing semantic resources such as ontologies and knowledge graphs, the evaluation of these resources-addressing quality issues- has not yet been thoroughly investigated. To address this gap, we propose an LLM-driven approach for the verification of ontology restrictions. We replicate our previously conducted human-in-the-loop experiment using ChatGPT-4 instead of human contributors to assess whether comparable ontology verification results can be obtained. We find that (1) ChatGPT-4 achieves intermediate-to-expert scores on an ontology modelling qualification test; (2) the model performs ontology restriction verification with accuracy of 92.22%; (3) combining model answers on the same ontology axiom represented in different formalisms improves the accuracy to 96.67%; and (4) higher accuracy is observed in identifying defects related to the incompleteness of ontology axioms compared to errors due to restrictions misuse. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs in supporting knowledge engineering tasks and outline future research directions in the area. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defect Detection; Large Language Models; Ontology Evaluation; Engineering Research; Errors; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Defect Detection; Engineering Tasks; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model-driven; Ontology Axioms; Ontology Evaluations; Ontology Graphs; Ontology's; Semantic Resources; Semantics","Engineering research; Errors; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Ontology; Defect detection; Engineering tasks; Language model; Large language model; Model-driven; Ontology axioms; Ontology evaluations; Ontology graphs; Ontology's; Semantic resources; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203385177"

Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics are a fundamental part of this environment as they allow intelligent systems and scientists to navigate the ever-growing number of research papers. However, creating these classifications manually is an expensive and time-consuming process, often resulting in outdated and coarse-grained representations. Consequently, researchers have been focusing on developing automated or semi-automated methods to create taxonomies of research topics. This paper studies the application of transformer-based language models for generating research topic ontologies. Specifically, we have developed a model leveraging SciBERT to identify four semantic relationships between research topics (supertopic, subtopic, same-as, and other) and conducted a comparative analysis against alternative solutions. The preliminary findings indicate that the transformer-based model significantly surpasses the performance of models reliant on traditional features. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Generation; Language Models; Ontology Generation; Research Topics; Scibert; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Recommender Systems; Semantics; Taxonomies; Artificial Intelligence Technologies; Current Generation; Graph Generation; Knowledge Graph Generation; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Ontology Generation; Ontology's; Research Topics; Scibert; Question Answering","Knowledge graph; Ontology; Recommender systems; Semantics; Taxonomies; Artificial intelligence technologies; Current generation; Graph generation; Knowledge graph generation; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Ontology generation; Ontology's; Research topics; SciBERT; Question answering","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203384989"

Extracting and manipulating this type of information is a crucial step in complex processes such as human reasoning. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to be useful for extracting and enriching knowledge graphs and ontologies, previous work has largely focused on comparing architecture-specific models (e.g. encoder-decoder only) across benchmarks from similar domains. In this work, we provide a large-scale comparison of the performance of certain LLM features (e.g. model architecture and size) and task learning methods (fine-tuning vs. in-context learning (iCL)) on text-to-graph benchmarks in the biomedical domain. Our experiment suggests that, while a simple truncation-based heuristic can notably boost the performance of decoder-only models used with iCL, small fine-tuned encoder-decoder models produce the most stable and strong performance. Moreover, we found that a massive out-of-domain text-graph pre-training has a positive impact on fine-tuned models, while we observed only a marginal impact of pre-training and size for decoder-only iCL models. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","In-context Learning; Information Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Word Embeddings; Benchmarking; Contrastive Learning; Decoding; Graph Embeddings; Ontology; Context Learning; Embeddings; In Contexts; In-context Learning; Information Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Performance; Word Embedding; Knowledge Graph","Benchmarking; Contrastive Learning; Decoding; Graph embeddings; Ontology; Context learning; Embeddings; In contexts; In-context learning; Information extraction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Performance; Word embedding; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85203342156"

Despite the significant progress made in protein function prediction by the community in the last decade, the general accuracy of protein function prediction is still not high, particularly for rare function terms associated with few proteins in the protein function annotation database such as the UniProt. Results: We introduce TransFew, a new transformer model, to learn the representations of both protein sequences and function labels [Gene Ontology (GO) terms] to predict the function of proteins. TransFew leverages a large pre-trained protein language model (ESM2-t48) to learn function-relevant representations of proteins from raw protein sequences and uses a biological natural language model (BioBert) and a graph convolutional neural network-based autoencoder to generate semantic representations of GO terms from their textual definition and hierarchical relationships, which are combined together to predict protein function via the cross-attention. Integrating the protein sequence and label representations not only enhances overall function prediction accuracy, but delivers a robust performance of predicting rare function terms with limited annotations by facilitating annotation transfer between GO terms.

This study delves into the utilization of these large language models (LLMs) in two learning scenarios - zero-shot and in-context learning - to address the extraction of procedures from unstructured PDF texts through incremental question-answering techniques. Specifically, we employ the cutting-edge GPT-4 (Generative Pre-trained Transformer 4) model, alongside two variations of in-context learning methodologies. These methods incorporate an ontology with definitions of procedures and steps, as well as a limited set of samples for few-shot learning.

Nonetheless, the intricacy of medical terminology and the breadth of ontological data often obscure the inner workings of such models. Despite the growing complexity of artificial intelligence methodologies and the pressing demand for medical tools that seamlessly integrate into clinical workflows, this opacity persists. We propose enhancing clinical Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) models with graph attention networks that encode diagnosis and medication concept hierarchies derived from primary care data. In 10-fold cross-validation on cardiovascular and respiratory detection tasks, our graph-enhanced model marginally improves F1 performance over baseline BERT. More importantly, our approach surfaces clinically deterministic patterns in patient groups, provides modular visualisations of influential terminal and ancestral medical concepts, and improves clustering of related conditions. Additionally, the hierarchical encoding allows quantitative analysis of edge relevance within and across diagnosis and medical ontologies. Our research shows that injecting structured knowledge graphs into language model architectures can improve performance through domain-specific regularisation. Additionally, the use of class activation maps throughout the approach allows for richer interpretations of predictions by following activation flows along concept relationships. The dual utility of precise ontology encoding and Large Language Models makes our graph-injected clinical language model more accurate and trustworthy, propelling preventive precision medicine forward. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Health Records; Graph Neural Networks; Large Language Models; Medical Ontology; Clinical Research; Diagnosis; Electronic Health Record; Ontology; Clinical Interventions; Electronic Health; Graph Neural Networks; Health Records; Language Model; Large Language Model; Medical Ontology; Ontology's; Predictive Models; Primary Care","Clinical research; Diagnosis; Electronic health record; Ontology; Clinical interventions; Electronic health; Graph neural networks; Health records; Language model; Large language model; Medical ontology; Ontology's; Predictive models; Primary care","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201980956"

Despite its stringent regulation within the medical field, the process of obtaining informed consent is frequently hindered by systemic, clinician-related, and patient-related factors, necessitating interventions at various levels. Notably, studies have shown that these factors often result in uninformed decisions, particularly in the context of hospitalization or intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach for enhancing the medical e-consent process by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge graphs. The objective is to provide support during the consent process. Our proposal deal with 1) legal validation of consent documents for content clarity and comprehension verification; 2) personalization of content and interactions based on patient preferences and medical history; and 3) semantic reasoning integration into healthcare system information using knowledge graphs and ontologies. The overarching architectural objective of our proposal is to ensure a well-informed, adaptable, and legally valid consent process. Scenarios explaining the process based on data provided by our collaborators, is also detailed. The results show an improvement in the process and confirm the interest of the proposed LLM for informed consent management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","E-consent; Healthcare Information Systems; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Electronic Health Record; Modeling Languages; Consent Managements; E-consent; Healthcare Information System; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Medical Fields; Personalizations; Related Factors; Stringent Regulations; Knowledge Graph","Electronic health record; Modeling languages; Consent managements; E-consent; Healthcare information system; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Medical fields; Personalizations; Related factors; Stringent regulations; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201949912"

This paper introduces a novel approach that integrates large language models (LLMs) with domain-specific knowledge graphs to tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional and intricate fault data in power distribution networks. A multi-dimensional fault ontology [13] is proposed to efficiently structure the fault data, facilitating the creation of a comprehensive fault knowledge graph. To enhance the diagnostic predictions of the LLM, a reinforcement learning-based node selection algorithm is implemented, strategically choosing pertinent nodes from the fault graph to enhance the model’s reasoning abilities. Experimental findings illustrate that this approach surpasses traditional statistical methods and direct LLM reasoning, achieving superior accuracy and efficiency in fault diagnosis. By incorporating selective knowledge graph node sampling, irrelevant noise is filtered out from the fault data, sharpening the LLM’s focus and eradicating “AI hallucinations,” thereby improving analytical precision. Validation on a real-world dataset from a power company confirms the method’s efficacy, promising swift and accurate fault analysis while reducing the time required for power grid fault diagnosis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Fault Attribution Analysis; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Models; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Electric Fault Currents; Electric Network Analysis; Electric Power Distribution; Electric Utilities; Fault Detection; Graph Theory; Graphic Methods; Knowledge Graph; Reinforcement Learning; Reliability Analysis; Sentiment Analysis; Fault Attribution Analyse; Fault Data; Faults Diagnosis; Graph-based; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Node Sampling; Power Distribution Network; System's Stabilities; Failure Analysis","Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Electric fault currents; Electric network analysis; Electric power distribution; Electric utilities; Fault detection; Graph theory; Graphic methods; Knowledge graph; Reinforcement learning; Reliability analysis; Sentiment analysis; Fault attribution analyse; Fault data; Faults diagnosis; Graph-based; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Node sampling; Power distribution network; System's stabilities; Failure analysis","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85201126619"

These range from generating labels for computer vision use cases, natural language tasks, language models, and other custom enterprise models. Label engineering is becoming a hot topic when it comes to training intelligent systems with initial ground truth data and iterating on existing models for improvement, for large-scale business use cases. The processes for generating ground truth data through labeling and natural language annotations can be very cumbersome, because very few standardization approaches have been researched on. In this paper, we review the existing literature and present the challenges in label engineering. We also propose methodologies that can help generate trustworthy and reliable labels through well-governed and regulated processes and pipelines. It is important to understand the benefits and drawbacks of different approaches and choose which best suits our use cases. After understanding these challenges and choosing what approach to take during the architecture phase, it becomes important to have explainability for the model. In case of unexpected outcomes, the model can be traced back to the set of labels that led to the model training in a direction leading to the problematic classification.

The integration of ontology facilitates the formulation of educational knowledge concepts, student behaviors, and their relations. Traditional ontology creation requires deep domain knowledge and significant manual effort. However, advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have offered a novel opportunity to automate and refine this process. In this paper, we propose an LLMs-driven educational ontology learning approach aimed to enhance student performance predictions. We leverage LLMs to process lecture slide texts to identify knowledge concepts and their interrelations, while question texts are used to associate them with the concepts they assess. This process facilitates the generation of the educational ontology that links knowledge concepts and maps to student interactions. Additionally, we deploy a dual-branch Graph Neural Network (GNN) with distance-weighted pooling to analyze both global and local graph information for student performance prediction. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of using LLMs for ontology-based enhancements in educational settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Educational Data Mining; Gnn; Knowledge Graph; Llm; Ontology; Student Performance Prediction; Domain Knowledge; Education Computing; Forecasting; Graph Neural Networks; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Ontology; Students; Educational Data Mining; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model-driven; Ontology's; Performance Prediction; Student Performance; Student Performance Prediction; Data Mining","Domain Knowledge; Education computing; Forecasting; Graph neural networks; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Ontology; Students; Educational data mining; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Model-driven; Ontology's; Performance prediction; Student performance; Student performance prediction; Data mining","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200754108"

While Large Language Models have recently demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating natural language, their trustworthiness remains difficult to ascertain. The deployment of an explainable pipeline enables its application in high-risk activities, such as decision making. Addressing this demanding requirement is facilitated by the fertile ground of knowledge representation and automated reasoning research. Building upon previous work that explored the first step, we focus on the second step, named Concept2Text. The design of an explainable translation naturally lends itself to a logic-based model, once again highlighting the contribution of declarative programming to achieving explainability in AI. This paper explores a Prolog/CLP-based rewriting system designed to interpret concepts expressed in terms of classes and relations derived from a generic ontology, generating text in natural language. Its key features encompass hierarchical tree rewritings, modular multilingual generation, support for equivalent variants across semantic, grammar, and lexical levels, and a transparent rule-based system. We present the architecture and illustrate a simple working example that allows the generation of hundreds of different and equivalent rewritings relative to the input concept. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concept-to-text; Explainable Ai; Natural Language; Prolog; Abstracting; Decision Making; Logic Programming; Program Translators; Prolog (programming Language); Semantics; Translation (languages); Abstract Concept; Concept-to-text; Critical Steps; Data Interpretation; Explainable Ai; Its Applications; Language Model; Natural Languages; Prolog; Property; Knowledge Representation","Abstracting; Decision making; Logic programming; Program translators; PROLOG (programming language); Semantics; Translation (languages); Abstract concept; Concept-to-text; Critical steps; Data interpretation; Explainable AI; ITS applications; Language model; Natural languages; Prolog; Property; Knowledge representation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85200126703"

However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise, while sharing similar privacy concerns if the reasoning is performed in the cloud. An extensive evaluation using two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Context-awareness; Human Activity Recognition; Large Language Models; Computational Linguistics; Learning Systems; Ontology; Pattern Recognition; Professional Aspects; Activity Recognition; Commonsense Knowledge; Context- Awareness; Context-aware; Human Activities; Human Activity Recognition; Language Model; Large Language Model; Model Knowledge; Ontology's; Deep Learning","Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Ontology; Pattern recognition; Professional aspects; Activity recognition; Commonsense knowledge; Context- awareness; Context-Aware; Human activities; Human activity recognition; Language model; Large language model; Model knowledge; Ontology's; Deep learning","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199931500"

A challenging scenarios for artificial intelligence (AI) is using biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging, omics, and clinical) to provide diagnosis and treatment recommendations for cancerous conditions. Data and knowledge about biomedical entities like cancer, drugs, genes, proteins, and their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources. A knowledge graph (KG) can be constructed by integrating and extracting facts about semantically interrelated entities and relations. Such a KG not only allows exploration and question answering (QA) but also enables domain experts to deduce new knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for non-domain users due to their lack of understanding of the data assets and semantic technologies. In this paper1, we develop a domain KG to leverage cancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA. We constructed a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONO), which enables semantic reasoning for validating gene-disease (different types of cancer) relations. The KG is further enriched by harmonizing the ONO, controlled vocabularies, and biomedical concepts from scientific articles by employing BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extractors. Further, since the medical domain is evolving, where new findings often replace old ones, without having access to up-to-date scientific findings, there is a high chance an AI system exhibits concept drift while providing diagnosis and treatment. Therefore, we finetune the KG using large language models (LLMs) based on more recent articles and KBs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bioinformatics; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Machine Learning; Ontology; Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Decision Making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene Ontology; Genes; Machine Learning; Semantics; Bio-marker Discovery; Biological Process; Domain Experts; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Machine-learning; Ontology's; Question Answering; Scientific Articles; Knowledge Graph","Bioinformatics; Biomarkers; Computational linguistics; Data mining; Decision making; Diagnosis; Diseases; Gene Ontology; Genes; Machine learning; Semantics; Bio-marker discovery; Biological process; Domain experts; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Ontology's; Question Answering; Scientific articles; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199807340"

The aim of the International Workshop of Semantic Digital Humanities (SemDH) was to bridge this division and encourage closer collaboration and networking across diverse fields. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cultural Heritage; Digital Humanities; Fair; Knowledge Graphs; Large Language Models; Ontologies; Semantic Representation; Historic Preservation; Knowledge Graph; Semantic Web; Co-located; Cultural Heritages; Digital Humanities; Fair; International Workshops; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Semantic Representation; Ontology","Historic preservation; Knowledge graph; Semantic Web; Co-located; Cultural heritages; Digital humanities; FAIR; International workshops; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Semantic representation; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199140076"

Achieving effective individualization relies on dynamic adaptation of the learning path, typically facilitated by recommender systems. These systems offer personalized suggestions, commonly employing content-based or collaborative filtering approaches. However, traditional recommender systems often lack consideration of the semantics of learning elements. To address this limitation, ontology-based recommender systems integrate semantic modeling, establishing additional connections within a domain to enhance precision and context in recommendations. Notably, these systems mitigate the cold start problem and are particularly advantageous in learning environments with limited data. While videos are prevalent in learning platforms, their unstructured nature poses challenges for processing. This paper introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Large Language Models, specifically GPT, to extract metadata from learning videos. The proposed method intelligently augments videos and links them to a domain ontology, enabling the integration of videos into ontology-based recommender systems. The application of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in software engineering education, showcasing its potential to enhance individualized learning experiences in specific domains. The presented method offers an automated alternative to manual video processing, aligning with the evolving landscape of education technology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Learning Environments; Generative Ai; Large Language Models; Learning Analytics; Learning Videos; Ontology-based Recommender Systems; Collaborative Filtering; Computational Linguistics; Computer Aided Instruction; Engineering Education; Learning Systems; Metadata; Ontology; Semantics; Video Signal Processing; Adaptive Learning Environment; Generative Ai; Individualized Learning; Language Model; Large Language Model; Learning Analytic; Learning Environments; Learning Video; Ontology-based; Ontology-based Recommende System; Recommender Systems","Collaborative filtering; Computational linguistics; Computer aided instruction; Engineering education; Learning systems; Metadata; Ontology; Semantics; Video signal processing; Adaptive learning environment; Generative AI; Individualized learning; Language model; Large language model; Learning analytic; Learning environments; Learning video; Ontology-based; Ontology-based recommende system; Recommender systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199069048"

Statistical modelling alone is insufficient for such analyses, mandating higher-level representations such as ontology to capture important relationships. However, constructing ontologies for ABI, ensuring they remain grounded to real-world entities, and maintaining their applicability to downstream tasks requires substantial hand-tooling by domain experts. In this paper, we propose the use of a Large Language Model (LLM) to bootstrap a grounding for such an ontology. Subsequently, we demonstrate that the experience encoded within the weights of a pre-trained LLM can be used in a zero-shot manner to provide a model of normalcy, enabling ABI analysis at the semantics level, agnostic to the precise coordinate data. This is accomplished through a sequence of two transformations, made upon a kinematic track, toward natural language narratives suitable for LLM input. The first transformation generates an abstraction of the low-level kinematic track, embedding it within a knowledge graph using a domain-specific ABI ontology. Secondly, we employ a template-driven narrative generation process to form natural language descriptions of behavior. Computation of the LLM perplexity score upon these narratives achieves grounding of the ontology. This use does not rely on any prompt engineering. In characterizing the perplexity score for any given track, we observe significant variability given chosen parameters such as sentence verbosity, attribute count, clause ordering, and so on. Consequently, we propose an approach that considers multiple generated narratives for an individual track and the distribution of perplexity scores for downstream applications. We demonstrate the successful application of this methodology against a semantic track association task. Our subsequent analysis establishes how such an approach can be used to augment existing kinematics-based association algorithms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Activity Based Intelligence; Large Language Model; Ontology; Track Association; Computational Linguistics; Kinematics; Knowledge Graph; Semantics; Zero-shot Learning; Activity Based Intelligences; Down-stream; Kinematics Tracks; Language Model; Large Language Model; Natural Languages; Ontology's; Real-world Entities; Statistic Modeling; Track Association; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Kinematics; Knowledge graph; Semantics; Zero-shot learning; Activity based intelligences; Down-stream; Kinematics tracks; Language model; Large language model; Natural languages; Ontology's; Real-world entities; Statistic modeling; Track association; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197783254"

There is much discussion in the media and a rapidly growing academic debate about its benefits and ethical risks. This article explores the profound influence of Socratic dialogue on Western and non-Western thought, emphasizing its role in the pursuit of truth through active thinking and dialectics. Unlike Socratic dialogue, ChatGPT generates plausible-sounding answers based on pre-trained data, lacking the pursuit of objective truth, personal experience, intuition, and empathy. The LLM’s responses are limited by its training dataset and algorithms, which can perpetuate biases or misinformation. While a true dialogue is a creative, philosophical exchange filled with ontological, ethical, and existential meanings, interactions with ChatGPT are characterized as interactive data processing. But is this really true? Perhaps we are underestimating the evolutionary growth potential of large language models? These questions have important implications for theoretical debates in cognitive science, changing our understanding of what cognition means in artificial and natural intelligence. This special issue examines ChatGPT as a subject of philosophical analysis from a position of cautious optimism and rather harsh criticism. It includes six articles covering a wide range of topics. The first group of researchers emphasizes that machine understanding and communication matches human practice. Others argue that AI cannot reach human levels of intelligence because it lacks conceptual thinking and the ability to create. Such contradictory interpretations only confirm the complexity and ambiguity of the phenomenon. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai Ethics Code; Articificial Intelligence; Chatgpt; Dialogue; Large Language Model; Responsibility","","Editorial","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85197669522"

By integrating the ontology of actions, user intentions, and context and connecting it to spatial data mapping, this forward-looking framework aims to create a contextually adaptive user interaction environment.

However, current models lack adequate semantics of the terminology of the underlying domain model, leading to inconsistent interpretations and uses of information. Ontology-driven conceptual modeling languages provide primitives for articulating these domain notions based on the ontological categories, i.e., stereotypes put forth by upper-level (or foundational) ontologies. Existing CMs have been created using ontologically-neutral languages (e.g., UML, ER). Enriching these models with ontological categories can better support model evaluation, meaning negotiation, semantic interoperability, and complexity management. However, manual stereotyping is prohibitive, given the sheer size of the legacy base of ontologically-neutral models. In this paper, we present a graph language modeling framework for conceptual models that combines finetuning pre-trained language models to learn the vector representation of OntoUML models’ data and then perform a graph neural networks-based node classification that exploits the model’s graph structure to predict the stereotype of model classes and relations. We show with an extensive comparative evaluation that our approach significantly outperforms existing stereotype prediction approaches. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Neural Networks; Ontology-driven Conceptual Models; Pre-trained Language Model; Representation Learning; Computational Linguistics; Graph Neural Networks; Graphic Methods; Ontology; Semantics; Conceptual Model; Current Modeling; Domain Model; Graph Languages; Language Model; Modelling Framework; Ontology-driven Conceptual Modeling; Pre-trained Language Model; Representation Learning; Modeling Languages","Computational linguistics; Graph neural networks; Graphic methods; Ontology; Semantics; Conceptual model; Current modeling; Domain model; Graph languages; Language model; Modelling framework; Ontology-Driven Conceptual Modeling; Pre-trained language model; Representation learning; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196728599"

Objective: As cohort studies form the basis of data-driven analysis, harmonizing them is crucial for cross-cohort analysis. We aimed to accelerate this task by constructing an automatic harmonization tool. Methods: We created a common data model (CDM) through cross-mapping data from 20 cohorts, three CDMs, and ontology terms, which was then used to fine-tune a BioBERT model. Finally, we evaluated the model using three previously unseen cohorts and compared its performance to a string-matching baseline model. Results: Here, we present our AD-Mapper interface for automatic harmonization of AD cohort studies, which outperformed a string-matching baseline on previously unseen cohort studies. We showcase our CDM comprising 1218 unique variables.

Nevertheless, numerous studies have disregarded its potential applications in the zero-shot setting. In this article, a novel framework, called knowledge-based prompt tuning for zero-shot relation triplet extraction (KBPT), was developed, founded on external ontology knowledge. This framework serves as a catalyst for exploring relation triplet extraction (RTE) methods within low-resource scenarios, warranting further scrutiny. Zero-shot setting RTE aims to extract multiple triplets that consist of head entities, tail entities, and relation labels from an input sentence, where the extracted relation labels are those that do not exist in the training set. To address the data scarcity problem in zero-shot RTE, a technique was introduced to synthesize training samples by prompting language models to generate structured texts. Specifically, this involves integrating language model prompts with structured text methodologies to create a structured prompt template. This template draws upon relation labels and ontology knowledge to generate synthetic training examples. The incorporation of external ontological knowledge enriches the semantic representation within the prompt template, enhancing its effectiveness. Further, a multiple triplets decoding (MTD) algorithm was developed to overcome the challenge of extracting multiple relation triplets from a sentence. To bridge the gap between knowledge and text, a collective training method was established to jointly optimize embedding representations. The proposed model is model-agnostic and can be applied to various PLMs. Exhaustive experiments on four public datasets with zero-shot settings were conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Compared to the baseline models, KBPT demonstrated enhancements of up to 14.65% and 24.19% in F1 score on the Wiki-ZSL and TACRED-Revisit datasets, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model achieved better performance compared with the current state-ofthe- art (SOTA) model in terms of F1 score, precision-recall (P–R) curves and AUC.

Recent studies have highlighted the improvements that can be made to the quality of information retrieved from PLMs by adding explicit knowledge from external source like KGs to otherwise naive PEFTs. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledgeable adapter, Know-adapter, to incorporate structure and semantic knowledge of knowledge graphs into PLMs for few-shot NER. First, we construct a related KG entity type sequence for each sentence using a knowledge retriever. However, the type system of a domain-specific NER task is typically independent of that of current KGs and thus exhibits heterogeneity issue inevitably, which makes matching between the original NER and KG types (e.g. Person in NER potentially matches President in KBs) less likely, or introduces unintended noises. Thus, then we design a unified taxonomy based on KG ontology for KG entity types and NER labels. This taxonomy is used to build a learnable shared representation module, which provides shared representations for both KG entity type sequences and NER labels. Based on these shared representations, our Know-adapter introduces high semantic relevance knowledge and structure knowledge from KGs as inductive bias to guide the updating process of the adapter. Additionally, the shared representations guide the learnable representation module to reduce noise in the unsupervised expansion of label words. Extensive experiments on multiple NER datasets show the superiority of Know-Adapter over other state-of-the-art methods in both full-resource and low-resource settings. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Few-shot Ner; Knowledge Graph; Peft; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Entity-types; Explicit Knowledge; Few-shot Named Entity Recognition; Fine Tuning; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Model Adaptation; Named Entity Recognition; Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning; Shared Representations; Taxonomies","Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Entity-types; Explicit knowledge; Few-shot named entity recognition; Fine tuning; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Model Adaptation; Named entity recognition; Parameter-efficient fine-tuning; Shared representations; Taxonomies","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195978715"

An exception is the Multidimensional Quality Metrics (MQM) framework which offers a fine-grained ontology of quality dimensions for scoring (such as style, fluency, accuracy, and terminology). Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of MQM annotation but there are, to our knowledge, no computational models that predict MQM scores for novel texts, due to a lack of resources. In this paper, we address these shortcomings by (a) providing a 1200-sentence MQM evaluation benchmark for the language pair English-Korean and (b) reframing MT evaluation as the multi-task problem of simultaneously predicting several MQM scores using SOTA language models, both in a reference-based MT evaluation setup and a reference-free quality estimation (QE) setup. We find that reference-free setup outperforms its counterpart in the style dimension while reference-based models retain an edge regarding accuracy.

However, such models have also made it possible to learn high-quality decontextualised concept embeddings. Three main strategies for learning such embeddings have thus far been considered: (i) fine-tuning the LM to directly predict concept embeddings from the name of the concept itself, (ii) averaging contextualised representations of mentions of the concept in a corpus, and (iii) encoding definitions of the concept. As these strategies have complementary strengths and weaknesses, we propose to learn a unified embedding space in which all three types of representations can be integrated. We show that this allows us to outperform existing approaches in tasks such as ontology completion, which heavily depends on access to high-quality concept embeddings. We furthermore find that mentions and definitions are well-aligned in the resulting space, enabling tasks such as target sense verification, even without the need for any fine-tuning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Concept Embeddings; Definitions; Language Models; Lexical Semantics; Computational Linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Modeling Languages; Semantics; Signal Encoding; Concept Embedding; Definition; Embeddings; Encodings; Fine Tuning; High Quality; Language Model; Learn+; Lexical Semantics; Modeling Concepts","Computational linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Modeling languages; Semantics; Signal encoding; Concept embedding; Definition; Embeddings; Encodings; Fine tuning; High quality; Language model; Learn+; Lexical semantics; Modeling concepts","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195976382"

Many dictionaries also provide examples to illustrate the prototypical usage of words, which brings further opportunities for training or enriching NLP models. The intrinsic qualities of dictionaries, and related lexical resources such as glossaries and encyclopedias, are however still not well-understood. While there has been significant work on developing best practices, such guidance has been aimed at traditional usages of dictionaries (e.g. supporting language learners), and it is currently unclear how different quality aspects affect the NLP systems that rely on them. To address this issue, we compare WordNet, the most commonly used lexical resource in NLP, with a variety of dictionaries, as well as with examples that were generated by ChatGPT. Our analysis involves human judgments as well as automatic metrics. We furthermore study the quality of word embeddings derived from dictionary examples, as a proxy for downstream performance. We find that WordNet's examples lead to lower-quality embeddings than those from the Oxford dictionary. Surprisingly, however, the ChatGPT generated examples were found to be most effective overall. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dictionary Examples; Lexical Resources; Semantics; Embeddings; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Best Practices; Dictionary Definitions; Dictionary Example; Human Judgments; Language Model; Lexical Resources; Nlp Systems; Quality Aspects; Wordnet; Semantics","Embeddings; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Best practices; Dictionary definitions; Dictionary example; Human judgments; Language model; Lexical resources; NLP systems; Quality aspects; Wordnet; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195959037"

However models trained on datasets where KG and text pairs are not equivalent can suffer from more hallucination and poorer recall. In this paper, we verify this empirically by generating datasets with different levels of noise and find that noisier datasets do indeed lead to more hallucination. We argue that the ability of forward and reverse models trained on a dataset to cyclically regenerate source KG or text is a proxy for the equivalence between the KG and the text in the dataset. Using cyclic evaluation we find that manually created WebNLG is much better than automatically created TeKGen and T-REx. Informed by these observations, we construct a new, improved dataset called LAGRANGE using heuristics meant to improve equivalence between KG and text and show the impact of each of the heuristics on cyclic evaluation. We also construct two synthetic datasets using large language models (LLMs), and observe that these are conducive to models that perform significantly well on cyclic generation of text, but less so on cyclic generation of KGs, probably because of a lack of a consistent underlying ontology. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Forward Modeling; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Neural Modelling; Noisy Datasets; Ontology's; Reverse Modeling; Synthetic Datasets; Large Datasets","Knowledge graph; Forward modeling; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Neural modelling; Noisy datasets; Ontology's; Reverse Modeling; Synthetic datasets; Large datasets","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195942803"

Injecting open rule knowledge into the machine helps to improve the performance of downstream tasks such as dialogue and relation extraction.

To address these issues, we propose a progressive multi-stage open rule generation method called PRIMO. We introduce ontology information during the rule generation stage to reduce ambiguity and improve rule accuracy. PRIMO constructs a multi-stage structure consisting of generation, extraction, and ranking modules to fully leverage the latent knowledge within the language model across multiple dimensions. Furthermore, we employ reinforcement learning from human feedback to further optimize model, enhancing the model's understanding of commonsense knowledge.

However, traditional WSD systems rely on WordNet as the underlying sense inventory, often differentiating meticulously between subtle nuances of word meanings, which may lead to excessive complexity and reduced practicality of WSD systems in today's NLP. Indeed, current Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) do seem to be able to perform disambiguation, but it is not clear to what extent, or to what level of granularity, they actually operate. In this paper, we address these points and, firstly, introduce a new large-scale resource that leverages homonymy relations to systematically cluster WordNet senses, effectively reducing the granularity of word senses to a very coarse-grained level; secondly, we use this resource to train Homonymy Disambiguation systems and investigate whether PLMs are inherently able to differentiate coarse-grained word senses. Our findings demonstrate that, while state-of-the-art models still struggle to choose the correct fine-grained meaning of a word in context, Homonymy Disambiguation systems are able to differentiate homonyms with up to 95% accuracy scores even without fine-tuning the underlying PLM.

Particularly, scheduling textual data often exists in natural language form, lacking clear structure and standardization. Processing and utilizing such diverse data necessitates extensive domain knowledge and professional expertise. To tackle this challenge, a method based on large language model has been proposed to construct a knowledge graph for water engineering scheduling. This approach involves collecting and preprocessing scheduling rule data at the data layer, leveraging large language models to extract embedded knowledge, constructing the ontology at the conceptual layer, and extracting the“three- step”method prompt strategy at the instance layer. Under the interaction of the data, conceptual, and instance layers, high-performance extraction of rule texts is achieved, and the construction of the dataset and knowledge graph is completed. Experimental results show that the F1 value of the extraction method in this paper reaches 85.5%, and the effectiveness and rationality of the modules of the large language model are validated through ablation experiments. This graph integrates dispersed water conservancy rule information, effectively handles unstructured textual data, and offers visualization querying and functionality tracing. It aids professionals in assessing water conditions and selecting appropriate scheduling schemes, providing valuable support for conservancy decision-making and intelligent reasoning. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Extraction; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model (llm); Ontology Construction; Water Engineering Scheduling","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195585807"

Most visual datasets are created and curated for specific tasks or with limited data distribution for very specific fields of interest, and there is no unified approach to manage and access them across diverse sources, tasks, and taxonomies. This not only creates unnecessary overheads when building robust visual recognition systems, but also introduces biases into learning systems and limits the capabilities of data-centric AI. To address these problems, we propose the VisionKnowledge Graph (VisionKG), a novel resource that interlinks, organizes and manages visual datasets via knowledge graphs and Semantic Web technologies. It can serve as a unified framework facilitating simple access and querying of state-of-the-art visual datasets, regardless of their heterogeneous formats and taxonomies. One of the key differences between our approach and existing methods is that VisionKG is not only based on metadata but also utilizes a unified data schema and external knowledge bases to integrate, interlink, and align visual datasets. It enhances the enrichment of the semantic descriptions and interpretation at both image and instance levels and offers data retrieval and exploratory services via SPARQL and natural language empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). VisionKG currently contains 617 million RDF triples that describe approximately 61 million entities, which can be accessed at https://vision.semkg.org and through APIs.

Several techniques have been developed for KG construction from text, but the lack of standardized datasets hinders the evaluation of triple extraction methods. The evaluation of existing KG construction approaches is based on structured data or manual investigations. To overcome this limitation, this work introduces a novel dataset specifically designed to evaluate KG construction techniques from unstructured text. Our dataset consists of a diverse collection of compound and complex sentences meticulously annotated by human annotators with potential triples (subject, predicate, object). The annotations underwent further scrutiny by expert ontologists to ensure accuracy and consistency. For evaluation purposes, the proposed F-measure criterion offers a robust approach to quantify the relatedness and assess the alignment between extracted triples and the ground-truth triples, providing a valuable tool for evaluating the performance of triple extraction systems. By providing a diverse collection of high-quality triples, our proposed benchmark dataset offers a comprehensive training and evaluation set for refining the performance of state-of-the-art language models on a triple extraction task.

Utilizing the linking between Princeton WordNet, Wikidata, and multilingual resources from Wikipedia, the proposed approach successfully mapped 17% of Princeton WordNet (PWN) content to Ukrainian Wikipedia. Furthermore, the study introduces three innovative strategies for generating new entries to fill in the gaps of the Ukrainian WordNet: machine translation, the Hypernym Discovery model, and the Hypernym Instruction-Following LLaMA model.

Especially the latter tasks require knowledge about the relations underlying the associations (e.g., Taxonomic vs. Situational); however, to date, there is neither an established ontology of relations nor an effective labelling paradigm. Here, we test GPT-4’s ability to infer semantic relations for human-produced word associations. We use four human-labelled data sets of word associations and semantic features, with differing relation inventories and various levels of annotator agreement. We directly prompt GPT-4 with detailed relation definitions without further fine-tuning or training. Our results show that while GPT-4 provided a good account of higher-level classifications (e.g., Taxonomic vs Situational), prompting instructions alone cannot obtain similar performance for detailed classifications (e.g., superordinate, subordinate or coordinate relations) despite high agreement among human annotators. This suggests that latent relations can at least be partially recovered from word associations and highlights ways in which LLMs could be improved and human annotation protocols could adapted to reduce coding ambiguity. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Semantic Relations; Word Associations; Ontology; Commonsense Knowledge; Labeled Data; Labelings; Language Model; Large Language Model; Latent Semantics; Ontology's; Semantic Ontology; Semantic Relations; Word-association; Semantics","Ontology; Commonsense knowledge; Labeled data; Labelings; Language model; Large language model; Latent semantics; Ontology's; Semantic ontology; Semantic relations; Word-association; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195200635"

As large language models (LLMs) are trained to maximize the conditional probabilities of upcoming words, they may capture the subtlety and nuances of the semantic constraints underlying the texts, and texts aligning with the encoded semantic constraints are more compressible than those that do not. This paper systematically tests whether and how LLMs can act as compressors of semantic pairs. Using semantic relations from English and Chinese Wordnet, we empirically demonstrate that texts with correct semantic pairings are more compressible than incorrect ones, measured by the proposed compression advantages index. We also show that, with the Pythia model suite and a fine-tuned model on Chinese Wordnet, compression capacities are modulated by the model’s seen data. These findings are consistent with the view that LLMs encode the semantic knowledge as underlying constraints learned from texts and can act as compressors of semantic information or potentially other structured knowledge. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Arithmetic Encoding; Chinese Wordnet; Compression; Large Language Model; Lexical Resource; Compressors; Computational Linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Ontology; Signal Encoding; Arithmetic Encoding; Chinese Wordnet; Compression; Encodings; Language Model; Large Language Model; Lexical Resources; Semantic Constraints; Semantic Relations; Wordnet; Semantics","Compressors; Computational linguistics; Encoding (symbols); Ontology; Signal encoding; Arithmetic encoding; Chinese wordnet; Compression; Encodings; Language model; Large language model; Lexical resources; Semantic constraints; Semantic relations; Wordnet; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195184478"

Specifically, our research question centres on the potential of LLMs in assisting human modellers, by generating OWL modelling suggestions and alternatives. We experiment with several state-of-the-art models. Our methodology incorporates diverse prompting techniques like Chain of Thoughts (CoT), Graph of Thoughts (GoT), and Decomposed Prompting, along with the Zero-shot method. Results show that currently, GPT-4 is the only model capable of providing suggestions of sufficient quality, and we also note the benefits and drawbacks of the prompting techniques. Overall, we conclude that it seems feasible to use advanced LLMs to generate OWL suggestions, which are at least comparable to the quality of human novice modellers.

We explore an approach with three steps: edge search which is to find a set of candidate locations to insert (i.e., subsumptions between concepts), edge formation and enrichment which leverages the ontological structure to produce and enhance the edge candidates, and edge selection which eventually locates the edge to be placed into. In all steps, we propose to leverage neural methods, where we apply embedding-based methods and contrastive learning with Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) such as BERT for edge search, and adapt a BERT fine-tuning-based multi-label Edge-Cross-encoder, and Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT series, FLAN-T5, and Llama 2, for edge selection. We evaluate the methods on recent datasets created using the SNOMED CT ontology and the MedMentions entity linking benchmark. The best settings in our framework use fine-tuned PLM for search and a multi-label Cross-encoder for selection. Zero-shot prompting of LLMs is still not adequate for the task, and we propose explainable instruction tuning of LLMs for improved performance.

However, the challenge lies in watching numerous videos and connecting key points from these videos with relevant study domains. This requires video characterization. Existing research on video characterization focuses on manual or automatic methods. These methods either require substantial human resources (experts to identify domain related videos and domain related areas in the videos) or rely on learner input (by relating video parts to their learning), often overlooking the assessment of their effectiveness in aiding learning. Manual methods are subjective, prone to errors and time consuming. Automatic supervised methods require training data which in many cases is unavailable. In this paper we propose a weakly supervised method that utilizes concepts from an ontology to guide models in thematically classifying and characterising video segments. Our research is concentrated in the health domain, conducting experiments with several models, including the large language model GPT-4. The results indicate that CorEx significantly outperforms other models, while GLDA and Guided BERTopic show limitations in this task. Although GPT-4 demonstrates consistent performance, it still falls behind CorEx. This study offers an innovative perspective in video-based learning, especially in automating the detection of learning themes in video content. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Model; Video-based Learning; Weakly Supervised Text Classification; Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Computer Vision; Learning Systems; Supervised Learning; Text Processing; Language Model; Large Language Model; Manual Methods; Short Text Classifications; Supervised Methods; Text Classification; Video Characterization; Video Segments; Video-based Learning; Weakly Supervised Text Classification; Image Segmentation","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Computer vision; Learning systems; Supervised learning; Text processing; Language model; Large language model; Manual methods; Short text classifications; Supervised methods; Text classification; Video characterization; Video segments; Video-based learning; Weakly supervised text classification; Image segmentation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85193977562"

One of these questions pertains to the quality of proposed pipelines employing language models for classifying informal definitions when training and testing samples are from different knowledge domains. This can introduce challenges due to varying vocabularies across domains or the potential for an entity to belong to different top-level concepts based on its domain. In this study, we present a study case where terms and informal definitions are extracted from 81 domain ontologies organized into 12 knowledge domains. We investigate the performance of a pipeline that utilizes the BERT language model for classifying domain entities into top-level concepts within a cross-domain classification scenario. Additionally, we explore various pipeline setups for input, preprocessing, and training steps. Our optimal classifier setup employs an unbalanced training methodology, no text preprocessing, and the concatenation of terms and informal definitions as input.

Although a variety of machine-learning approaches have been proposed that can simplify this task by learning the patterns from experts, such techniques are still susceptible to domain knowledge updates that could potentially change the patterns and lead to extra expert involvement. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated a general cognitive ability, which has the potential to assist ontology alignment from the cognition level, thus obviating the need for costly expert involvement. However, the process by which the output of LLMs is generated can be opaque and thus the reliability and interpretability of such models is not always predictable. This paper proposes a dialogue model, in which multiple agents negotiate the correspondence between two knowledge sets with the support from an LLM. We demonstrate that this approach not only reduces the need for the involvement of a domain expert for ontology alignment, but that the results are interpretable despite the use of LLMs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dialogue; Large Language Model; Multi-agent System; Negotiation; Ontology Alignment; Autonomous Agents; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Learning Systems; Ontology; Cross-domain; Dialog; Domain Experts; Human Domain; Language Model; Large Language Model; Machine Learning Approaches; Multi Agent; Negotiation; Ontology Alignment; Multi Agent Systems","Autonomous agents; Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Learning systems; Ontology; Cross-domain; Dialog; Domain experts; Human domain; Language model; Large language model; Machine learning approaches; Multi agent; Negotiation; Ontology alignment; Multi agent systems","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192997204"

The proposed layer computes the relevance between each input token and the classes in the ontology and then fuses the encoded token vectors and the class vectors to enhance the token vectors by explicit superior knowledge. In our experiments, we apply the proposed layer to various language models for an NER task based on a Chinese clinical dataset to evaluate the performance of the layer. We also investigate the influence of the granularity of the classes utilized in the ontology attention layer.

Natural language processing (NLP) offers the potential to extract valuable exercise information from clinical notes, aiding in the development of more effective rehabilitation strategies. Objective: This study aims to develop and evaluate a variety of NLP algorithms to extract and categorize physical rehabilitation exercise information from the clinical notes of patients who had a stroke treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. Methods: A cohort of 13,605 patients diagnosed with stroke was identified, and their clinical notes containing rehabilitation therapy notes were retrieved. A comprehensive clinical ontology was created to represent various aspects of physical rehabilitation exercises. State-of-the-art NLP algorithms were then developed and compared, including rule-based, machine learning–based algorithms (support vector machine, logistic regression, gradient boosting, and AdaBoost) and large language model (LLM)–based algorithms (ChatGPT [OpenAI]). The study focused on key performance metrics, particularly F<inf>1</inf>-scores, to evaluate algorithm effectiveness. Results: The analysis was conducted on a data set comprising 23,724 notes with detailed demographic and clinical characteristics. The rule-based NLP algorithm demonstrated superior performance in most areas, particularly in detecting the “Right Side” location with an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 0.975, outperforming gradient boosting by 0.063. Gradient boosting excelled in “Lower Extremity” location detection (F<inf>1</inf>-score: 0.978), surpassing rule-based NLP by 0.023. It also showed notable performance in the “Passive Range of Motion” detection with an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 0.970, a 0.032 improvement over rule-based NLP. The rule-based algorithm efficiently handled “Duration,” “Sets,” and “Reps” with F<inf>1</inf>-scores up to 0.65. LLM-based NLP, particularly ChatGPT with few-shot prompts, achieved high recall but generally lower precision and F<inf>1</inf>-scores. However, it notably excelled in “Backward Plane” motion detection, achieving an F<inf>1</inf>-score of 0.846, surpassing the rule-based algorithm’s 0.720. Conclusions: The study successfully developed and evaluated multiple NLP algorithms, revealing the strengths and weaknesses of each in extracting physical rehabilitation exercise information from clinical notes. The detailed ontology and the robust performance of the rule-based and gradient boosting algorithms demonstrate significant potential for enhancing precision rehabilitation. These findings contribute to the ongoing efforts to integrate advanced NLP techniques into health care, moving toward predictive models that can recommend personalized rehabilitation treatments for optimal patient outcomes. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Chatgpt; Electronic Health Records; Exercise; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Physical Exercise; Physical Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation; Rehabilitation Therapy; Stroke","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85191372441"

Its diverse primary applications include social media analysis on Facebook groups and YouTube learning videos related to the 2023 IEEE CIS Education Portal (EP) Subcommittee, as well as in the areas of Taiwanese/English language learning and dialogue experience with GAI image generation. To establish the knowledge and inference models for the QCI agent, we initially developed a Taiwanese/English learning and experience ontology, including a content attention ontology, and an image attention ontology. The QCI agent utilizes metrics such as the number of views, posts, and comments to predict the fuzzy number of reactions. In addition, the GAI image agent generates Taiwanese speech-based/English text-based images and evaluates the fuzzy similarity score between Taiwanese/English and the attention ontology together with the Sentence BERT (SBERT) agent. This Taiwanese/English fuzzy similarity score is further validated through human assessments, with these evaluations subsequently serving as an additional metric for comparative analysis of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). Furthermore, the GAI image agent is designed to create images and Chinese/English texts from text/speech translated by the Meta AI Universal Speech Translator (UST) Taiwanese/English agent. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based machine learning mechanism is employed to train the QCI model for assessing learners' performance and predicting the performance of others. The National University of Tainan (NUTN) Taiwan-Large Language Model (NUTN.TW-LLM) agent has been further enhanced to support interactive learning experiences for HMI. An SBERT-based assessment agent is used to calculate fuzzy similarities between questions and answers in Taiwanese/English experiences and dialogues.

However, the heterogeneity of IoT environments and the complexity and volume of IoT data present significant challenges to forensic practitioners. The advent of question answering (QA) systems and large language models (LLM) offers a potential solution to accessing sophisticated IoT forensic knowledge and data. In light of this, we propose ForensiQ, a framework based on knowledge graph question answering (KGQA), to help investigators navigate complex IoT forensic artifacts and cybersecurity knowledge. Our framework integrates knowledge graphs (KG) into the IoT forensic workflow to better organize and analyze forensic artifacts. We also have developed a novel KGQA model that serves as a natural-language user interface to the IoT forensic KG. Our evaluation results show that, compared to existing KGQA models, ForensiQ demonstrates higher accuracy in answering natural language questions when applied to our experimental IoT forensic KG. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Forensics; Internet Of Things; Knowledge Graph; Ontology Design; Question Answering; Computer Forensics; Cybersecurity; Electronic Crime Countermeasures; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing Systems; User Interfaces; Cyber Security; Evaluation Results; Forensic Practitioner; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Natural Languages; Ontology Design; Question Answering; Question Answering Systems; Work-flows; Internet Of Things","Computer forensics; Cybersecurity; Electronic crime countermeasures; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; User interfaces; Cyber security; Evaluation results; Forensic practitioner; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Natural languages; Ontology design; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Work-flows; Internet of things","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190706066"

Still, there is an increasing effort to combine the unstructured nature of LMs with structured knowledge and reasoning. Particularly in the rapidly evolving field of biomedical NLP, knowledge-enhanced language models (KELMs) have emerged as promising tools to bridge the gap between large language models and domain-specific knowledge, considering the available biomedical knowledge graphs (KGs) curated by experts over the decades. In this paper, we develop an approach that uses lightweight adapter modules to inject structured biomedical knowledge into pre-trained language models (PLMs). We use two large KGs, the biomedical knowledge system UMLS and the novel biochemical ontology OntoChem, with two prominent biomedical PLMs, BERT and BioLinkBERT. The approach includes partitioning knowledge graphs into smaller subgraphs, fine-tuning adapter modules for each subgraph, and combining the knowledge in a fusion layer. We test the performance on three downstream tasks: document classification, question answering, and natural language inference. We show that our methodology leads to performance improvements in several instances while keeping requirements in computing power low.

Yet, with more extensive use, it's evident that this approach has its own limitations. The inherent ambiguity of natural language proposes challenges to auto-generate synergistically structured artifacts that can be deployed. Model Driven Development (MDD) is therefore being highlighted in this research as a proper approach to overcome these challenges. Accordingly, we introduced an Agile Model- Driven Development (AMDD) approach that enhances code auto-generation using OpenAI's GPT-4. Our work emphasizes ""Agility"" as a significant contribution to the current MDD approach, particularly when the model undergoes changes or needs deployment in a different programming language. Thus, we presented a case-study showcasing a multi-agent simulation system of an Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF). In the first and second layer of our proposed approach, we modelled the structural and behavioural aspects of the case-study using Unified Modeling Language (UML). In the next layer, we introduced two sets of meta-modelling constraints that minimize the model ambiguity. Object Constraints Language (OCL) is applied to fine-tune the code constructions details, while FIPA ontology is used to shape the communication semantics. Ultimately, GPT-4 is used to auto-generate code from the model in both Java and Python. The Java code is deployed within the JADE framework, while the Python code is deployed in PADE framework. Concluding our research, we engaged in a comprehensive evaluation of the generated code. From a behavioural standpoint, the auto-generated code not only aligned with the expected UML sequence diagram, but also added new behaviours that improved the interaction among the classes. Structurally, we compared the complexity of code derived from UML diagrams constrained solely by OCL to that influenced by both OCL and FIPA-ontology. Results showed that ontology-constrained model produced inherently more intricate code, however it remains manageable. Thus, other constraints can still be added to the model without passing the complexity high risk threshold. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Ai-empowered; Auto-generated Code; Cyclomatic Complexity; Gpt-4; Model Driven Development; Object Constraint Language; Ontology-constrained Class Diagram","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85190369863"

It has many challenges, among which including the quality of data used. In our research we focus on generating and including quality Proactive Control Data (PCD) to improve iContracts, which is a novel research scope in literature. Our scope is defined by the main challenge in regards to emerging legal technologies. Currently, the legal system is more reactive than proactive, leading to high consequential legal costs. By shifting the focus to proactiveness, we discuss and improve upon the available methodologies (Bow-Tie Method and Logocratic Method) and technologies (Ontology Engineering, Software Engineering and Large Language Models [LLMs]) to demonstrate a higher degree of proactiveness in iContracts. Our results are threefold. First, we prove that the generation of PCD is possible with the development of a prototype that leverages the foundations of the Bow-Tie Method. Second, we demonstrate that the impact of PCD on contract drafting is significant, as the explicit inclusion of PCD in prompt engineering alters significantly the content of an LLM-drafted contract. Third, we show how the quality of PCD can be assessed and improved upon with the application of the Logocratic Method. The discussion highlights the feasibility of the research with available technologies. Ultimately, the implementation of our research depends on organisational considerations and resource allocation. We conclude that the generation of PCD is feasible, their impact on contract drafting is significant and their quality assessment is both possible and novel. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bow-tie Method; Contract Automation; Intelligent Contracts; Large Language Models; Legal Technology; Logocratic Method; Ontology Engineering; Preventive/proactive Law; Software Engineering; Computational Linguistics; Contracts; Software Engineering; Bow-tie Methods; Contract Automation; Control Data; Intelligent Contract; Language Model; Large Language Model; Legal Technology; Logocratic Method; Ontology Engineering; Preventive/proactive Law; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Contracts; Software engineering; Bow-tie methods; Contract automation; Control data; Intelligent contract; Language model; Large language model; Legal technology; Logocratic method; Ontology engineering; Preventive/proactive law; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187647502"

Their general nature, and ability to ""understand"" natural language, has already stimulated multiple areas of research at our company. Here we successfully demonstrate a Natural Language querying system, which is able to search a large repository of unstructured exploration data. The system supports follow up querying on the returned results, plus automatic summarization of content. The system is integrated into our novel end-to-end data-mining platform, which continuously mines our unstructured exploration data for new changes and indexes the results. Important in our method are the enrichment processes that occur prior to use of the LLM. Our approach avoids usual ""chunking"" techniques, which in our experience results in inferior results, especially in the multiple domain areas of Exploration. By integrating our novel ontology-model AI in the enrichment of the initial Index, we drastically boost the performance of search resulting from the LLM steps. In order to perform the search, key parts of our unstructured data, plus the query itself, need to be transformed into a vector form. This is performed using the embedding feature of the LLM. For this work, we had around 500,000 embeddings to calculate. To improve performance these were indexed in a leading Analytics Engine as a vector object, allowing fast search via cosine or Euclidian similarity. A custom dashboard was made to allow fresh searches of the vector datastore to be returned for further analysis. Our current search time across 500,000 embeddings is under 20 milli-seconds. Our custom dashboard returns the top matches for further interrogation and analysis. This includes follow-up Natural Language question support on the returned matches for summarization tasks and other customised querying. Since our exploration-specific, ontology model is able to tag each piece of data with over 40 exploration-specific labels, we are able to cross-examine the LLM returned results with the tags. Agreement on a range of queries - ranging from targeted, highly specific questions to general, open-ended queries - was surprisingly good. Natural Language based querying of our unstructured data is opening a whole new approach to data discovery in our company. Tailoring it to the exploration domain has required specific domain expertise and a novel ontology-model be used to ensure relevant prompts and query results. Obtaining search results quickly has also required expertise and fine-tuning. Future directions include ingesting more data, scaling the support infrastructure and further capability enhancement. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Gasoline; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Search Engines; Embeddings; Exploration Data; Follow Up; General Nature; Language Model; Model Embedding; Multiple Areas; Natural Languages; Ontology Model; Unstructured Data","Data mining; Gasoline; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Search engines; Embeddings; Exploration data; Follow up; General nature; Language model; Model embedding; Multiple areas; Natural languages; Ontology model; Unstructured data","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187576256"

This processing includes creating language understanding models and translating resources into other natural languages to share domain-specific cross-lingual knowledge. In this work, we conduct investigations on clinical text machine translation by examining multilingual neural network models using deep learning such as Transformer based structures. Furthermore, to address the language resource imbalance issue, we also carry out experiments using a transfer learning methodology based on massive multilingual pre-trained language models (MMPLMs). The experimental results on three sub-tasks including (1) clinical case (CC), (2) clinical terminology (CT), and (3) ontological concept (OC) show that our models achieved top-level performances in the ClinSpEn-2022 shared task on English-Spanish clinical domain data. Furthermore, our expert-based human evaluations demonstrate that the small-sized pre-trained language model (PLM) outperformed the other two extra-large language models by a large margin in the clinical domain fine-tuning, which finding was never reported in the field. Finally, the transfer learning method works well in our experimental setting using the WMT21fb model to accommodate a new language space Spanish that was not seen at the pre-training stage within WMT21fb itself, which deserves more exploitation for clinical knowledge transformation, e.g. to investigate into more languages.

This devastating complication may cause consistent pain and dramatically reduction of functionality. Unfortunately, the conservative treatments to prevent the AF in the early stage are largely unknown due to the lack of specific biomarkers and reliable therapeutic targets. Methods: In this study, we extracted1782 fibrosis related genes (FRGs) from 373,461published literature based on the large natural language processing models (ChatGPT) and intersected with the 2750 differential expressed genes (DEGs) from mRNA microarray (GSE135854). A total of 311 potential AF biomarker genes (PABGs) were obtained and functional analysis were performed including gene ontology (GO) annotation and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses. Subsequently, we accomplished validation in AF animal models with immobilization of the unilateral knee joints of 16 rabbits for 1-week, 2-weeks, 3-weeks and 4-weeks. Finally, we tested the biomarkers in a retrospective cohort enrolled 35 AF patients and 35 control group patients. Results: We identified G-protein-coupled receptor 17 (GPR17) as a reliable therapeutic biomarker for AF diagnosis with higher AUC (0.819) in the ROC curve. A total of 21 potential drugs targeted to GPR17 were screened. Among them, pranlukast and montelukast have achieved therapeutic effect in animal models. In addition, we established an online AF database for data integration (https://chenxi2023.shinyapps.io/afdbv1). Conclusions: These results unveiling therapeutic biomarkers for AF diagnosis, and provide potential drugs for clinical treatment. The translational potential of this article: Our study demonstrated that GPR17 holds significant promise as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for arthrofibrosis.

The goal is to detect out-of-scope user intents that do not belong to a predefined intent ontology. However, establishing a reliable OOS detection system is challenging due to limited data availability. This situation necessitates solutions rooted in few-shot learning techniques. For such few-shot text classification tasks, prompt-based learning has been shown more effective than conventionally finetuned large language models with a classification layer on top. Thus, we advocate for exploring prompt-based approaches for OOS intent detection. Additionally, we propose a new evaluation metric, the Area Under the In-scope and Out-of-Scope Characteristic curve (AU-IOC). This metric addresses the shortcomings of current evaluation standards for OOS intent detection. AU-IOC provides a comprehensive assessment of a model’s dual performance capacities: in-scope classification accuracy and OOS recall. Under this new evaluation method, we compare our prompt-based OOS detector against 3 strong baseline models by exploiting the metadata of intent annotations, i.e., intent description. Our study found that our prompt-based model achieved the highest AU-IOC score across different data regimes. Further experiments showed that our detector is insensitive to a variety of intent descriptions. An intriguing finding shows that for extremely low data settings (1- or 5-shot), employing a naturally phrased prompt template boosts the detector’s performance compared to rather artificially structured template patterns. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dialogue Intent Classification; Few-shot Learning; Outlier/novelty Detection; Prompt-based Models; Learning Systems; Text Processing; Detection System; Dialog Intent Classification; Few-shot Learning; Intent Detection; Limited Data; Novelty Detection; Ontology's; Outlier/novelty Detection; Performance; Prompt-based Model; Classification (of Information)","Learning systems; Text processing; Detection system; Dialog intent classification; Few-shot learning; Intent detection; Limited data; Novelty detection; Ontology's; Outlier/novelty detection; Performance; Prompt-based model; Classification (of information)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85181448600"

Machine learning-based protein function prediction is an effective approach to solve this problem. Most of the existing methods only use the protein sequence but ignore the three-dimensional structure which is closely related to the protein function. And the hierarchy of protein functions is not adequately considered. To solve this problem, we propose a graph neural network (GNNGO3D) that combines the three-dimensional structure and functional hierarchy learning. GNNGO3D simultaneously uses three kinds of information: protein sequence, tertiary structure, and hierarchical relationship of protein function to predict protein function. The novelty of GNNGO3D lies in that it integrates the learning of functional level information into the method of predicting protein function by using tertiary structure information, fully learning the relationship between protein functions, and helping to better predict protein function. Experimental results show that our method is superior to existing methods for predicting protein function based on sequence and structure. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Graph Neural Networks; Language Model; Machine Learning; Protein Function Prediction; Feature Extraction; Gene Ontology; Graph Neural Networks; Job Analysis; Learning Systems; Proteins; Three Dimensional Displays; Convolutional Neural Network; Features Extraction; Gene Ontology; Language Model; Machine-learning; Ontology's; Protein Function Prediction; Protein Sequences; Task Analysis; Three-dimensional Display; Forecasting","Feature extraction; Gene Ontology; Graph neural networks; Job analysis; Learning systems; Proteins; Three dimensional displays; Convolutional neural network; Features extraction; Gene ontology; Language model; Machine-learning; Ontology's; Protein function prediction; Protein sequences; Task analysis; Three-dimensional display; Forecasting","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177076809"

However, given the online reviews of attractions involve overabundant mixed and intangible dimensions, the widely-used unsupervised text mining could be incomplete or inaccurate. Furthermore, the existing literature typically restricted to the certain types of attractions within several tourist destinations and origins, can hardly guarantee comprehensive insights. To overcome these limitations, the study proposes a novel knowledge-graph-driven framework, involving the systematic construction as well as the thorough investigation and inference of a tourism-oriented knowledge graph (TKG). Following the ontology of domain expertise, 11,296,716 structured triplets of multifaceted knowledge about 1,174,034 tourists and 20,481 attractions within all 340 city-level destinations across China are extracted from multi-source text corpus by the transferring learning on pre-training language model with 43.64–50.65 % accuracy enhancement. In virtue of TKG, a comprehensive decision-support system can be established, which bifurcates into two distinct modes of knowledge application: symbolic query and distributed reasoning. Through the implementation of multiple spatiotemporal analyses via SPARQL queries on TKG, the distribution regularities of tourist preference, causal interpretations, and their effects on destination development can be progressively detected. Refining the distributed representations of objects by injecting abundant contextual knowledge from TKG can significantly enhance the downstream inferential tasks, such as tourist demand prediction and attraction competitive intelligence. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Decision-making Support; Information Extraction; Knowledge Reasoning; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Tourism Knowledge Graph; Competition; Competitive Intelligence; Data Mining; Decision Support Systems; Knowledge Graph; Tourism; Decision Making Support; Decision Supports; Development Strategies; Information Extraction; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge Reasoning; Management Research; Spatiotemporal Analysis; Tourism Knowledge Graph; Tourism Management; Decision Making","Competition; Competitive intelligence; Data mining; Decision support systems; Knowledge graph; Tourism; Decision making support; Decision supports; Development strategies; Information extraction; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge reasoning; Management research; Spatiotemporal analysis; Tourism knowledge graph; Tourism management; Decision making","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85173611224"

These protein subcellular localization identifiers are unique regarding the database used, organisms, Machine Learning Technique, and accuracy. Despite the availability of these identifiers, the majority of the work has been done on the subcellular localization of proteins and, less work has been done specifically on locations of transmembrane proteins. This systematic review accounts for computational techniques implemented on transmembrane protein localization. Moreover, a literature search on PubMed, Science Direct, and IEEE Databases disclosed no systematic review or meta-analysis on the cell’s transmembrane protein locale. A Systematic review was formed under the guidelines of PRISMA by using Science Direct, PubMed, and IEEE Databases. Journal publications from 2000 to 2023 were taken into consideration and screened. This review has focused only on computational studies rather than experimental techniques. 1004 studies were reviewed and were categorized as relevant and non-relevant according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All the screening was done through Endnote after importing citations.

This research focuses on minimizing variability in the reporting of outcome measures through a comparative analysis of rule-based and advanced language modeling techniques. The rule-based method employs established ontologies, while the language model-based approach utilizes large language models.

LLMs have been applied to various application domains, including Knowledge Graph (KG) generation, question and answering over KGs and text-to-SPARQL translation. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs in text-to-SWRL translation, i.e., translation of Natural Language (NL) rules into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, put in the context of an industrial Ontology Engineering (OE) environment called GLUON, presenting our first experimental results. The aim of this work is to identify the level of automation that is adequate for the LLM to generate well-formed SWRL rules, towards the development of an LLM-based framework, as a plugin to the GLUON OE environment. In this direction we leverage and combine the reasoning capabilities of GPT-4o model, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology, and prompt engineering.

Essentially, it entails linking entities across different ontologies or knowledge graphs in order to resolve ambiguity and enhance the interoperability of data. While various techniques exist, many still rely on rule-based or logic-based approaches, often requiring human intervention and domain specificity. Despite these challenges, ontology alignment remains crucial for seamlessly integrating disparate knowledge sources and facilitating effective data integration. In this paper, we tackle the limitations of current ontology alignment models by introducing a novel, lightweight, semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning model called Deep Reinforcement Adaptive Learning for Ontology Alignment (DRAL-OA). The DRAL-OA method incorporates both syntactic and structural information into the training phase. In addition, this approach is semi-supervised, utilizing a portion of the training data and automatically generating the rest, which reduces the need for human intervention. Moreover, DRAL-OA uses non-domain-specific language models to ensure broad applicability and reduce the need for extensive domain expertise. We evaluate our proposed approach using two datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). In our experiments, we have shown that the proposed model can achieve high-quality alignments with F-measures on par with other state-of-the-art systems, all while maintaining a very short runtime and a compact model size. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Ontology Alignment; Reinforcement Learning; Semantic Web; Alignment; Data Integration; Deep Learning; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Knowledge Graph; Learning Algorithms; Ontology; Semantic Web; Supervised Learning; Syntactics; Adaptive Learning; Human Intervention; Knowledge Graphs; Ontology Alignment; Ontology Graphs; Ontology Matching; Reinforcement Learnings; Semantic-web; Semantics Heterogeneity; Semi-supervised; Reinforcement Learning","Alignment; Data integration; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Knowledge graph; Learning algorithms; Ontology; Semantic Web; Supervised learning; Syntactics; Adaptive learning; Human intervention; Knowledge graphs; Ontology alignment; Ontology graphs; Ontology matching; Reinforcement learnings; Semantic-Web; Semantics Heterogeneity; Semi-supervised; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008494417"

This paper presents a novel oversampling method for named entity recognition (NER) datasets using a generative approach. Our method leverages the power of the GPT-3 large language models in combination with the DBpedia knowledge graphs to create high-quality synthetic examples for underrepresented entity classes. The process starts by analyzing the dataset to identify entity types that require balancing. For each such entity, we explore the DBpedia knowledge graph to find similar or equivalent concepts using ontological relationships. These concepts are then used to create GPT-3 prompts, guiding them to generate contextually appropriate examples of the type of target entity. This process is repeated until a balanced distribution across all entity classes is achieved. Our approach aims to address the common challenge of class imbalance in NER datasets while maintaining semantic coherence and linguistic diversity in the generated examples.

To address this, this paper proposes an ontology embedding framework based on graph language models, named GLMSubs, aimed at enhancing the prediction of subclass relationships. The GLMSubs framework adopts a two-stage strategy of 'multi-semantic view partitioning' and 'advanced training of graph language models'. Initially, it deconstructs the ontology's concepts, attributes, and instance information into five types of semantic views, such as class hierarchy view and class-attribute relationship view, through a multi-view partitioning mechanism, comprehensively capturing information from different semantic dimensions. Subsequently, the framework employs graph language models for joint training on the multi-view data to obtain embeddings that integrate both semantic and structural information. Experiments on datasets such as FoodOn and GO validate the effectiveness of GLMSubs, demonstrating that its performance in class hierarchy relationship prediction tasks significantly surpasses existing methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Graph Language Models; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Representation Learning; Owl Ontology; Image Representation; Embeddings; Graph Language Model; Graph Languages; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge Representation Learning; Knowledge-representation; Language Model; Ontology's; Owl Ontologies; Semantic Views; Knowledge Graph","Image representation; Embeddings; Graph language model; Graph languages; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge representation learning; Knowledge-representation; Language model; Ontology's; OWL ontologies; Semantic views; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105007428875"

While extracting this information into a Knowledge Graph (KG) is a common approach, it suffers from challenges when texts are added, removed, or changed, or when the schema of the intended KG changes. Instead we advocate an approach where text and models evolve together in an interactive manner. We present LINTEXT, a system accompanying a published method which allows users to jointly explore and model the information held within text documents. The modeling is accomplished by specifying fill-in-the-blank prompts along with some metadata which are then recorded as specifications for simple relations that can be used to generate an ontology. The exploration aspect is accomplished by having the system complete each prompt with entities identified from the text and presenting the completions as a ranked list to the user, allowing users to verify the quality of the extracted triples. By elevating the development of the ontology to a visual and interactive level, it has an immediate text connection and users can be more certain that the documents they wish to model contain the information they wish to extract or query. Additionally, our system is designed to support the development of relation extraction (RE) pipelines underlying the document analysis, with a particular focus on supporting methods for improving vector representations of the extracted entities. To this end, users can choose to analyze documents from pre-annotated RE data sets to understand how changes in different elements of the pipeline affect the results. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Document-level Relation Extraction; Entity Embedding; Interactive Knowledge Modeling; Knowledge Graphs; Machine Reading; Masked Language Models; Document-level Relation Extraction; Embeddings; Entity Embedding; Interactive Knowledge Modeling; Knowledge Graphs; Knowledge Model; Language Model; Machine Reading; Masked Language Model; Relation Extraction; Knowledge Graph","Document-level relation extraction; Embeddings; Entity embedding; Interactive knowledge modeling; Knowledge graphs; Knowledge model; Language model; Machine reading; Masked language model; Relation extraction; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006925553"

A key strategy to overcome these challenges is integrating external knowledge into PLMs, enhancing their adaptability and clinical usefulness. Current biomedical knowledge graphs like UMLS (Unified Medical Language System), SNOMED CT (Systematized Medical Nomenclature for Medicine–Clinical Terminology), and HPO (Human Phenotype Ontology), while comprehensive, fail to effectively connect general biomedical knowledge with physician insights. There is an equally important need for a model that integrates diverse knowledge in a way that is both unified and compartmentalized. This approach not only addresses the heterogeneous nature of domain knowledge but also recognizes the unique data and knowledge repositories of individual health care institutions, necessitating careful and respectful management of proprietary information. Objective: This study aimed to enhance the clinical relevance and interpretability of PLMs by integrating external knowledge in a manner that respects the diversity and proprietary nature of health care data. We hypothesize that domain knowledge, when captured and distributed as stand-alone modules, can be effectively reintegrated into PLMs to significantly improve their adaptability and utility in clinical settings. Methods: We demonstrate that through adapters, small and lightweight neural networks that enable the integration of extra information without full model fine-tuning, we can inject diverse sources of external domain knowledge into language models and improve the overall performance with an increased level of interpretability. As a practical application of this methodology, we introduce a novel task, structured as a case study, that endeavors to capture physician knowledge in assigning cardiovascular diagnoses from clinical narratives, where we extract diagnosis-comment pairs from electronic health records (EHRs) and cast the problem as text classification. Results: The study demonstrates that integrating domain knowledge into PLMs significantly improves their performance. While improvements with ClinicalBERT are more modest, likely due to its pretraining on clinical texts, BERT (bidirectional encoder representations from transformer) equipped with knowledge adapters surprisingly matches or exceeds ClinicalBERT in several metrics. This underscores the effectiveness of knowledge adapters and highlights their potential in settings with strict data privacy constraints. This approach also increases the level of interpretability of these models in a clinical context, which enhances our ability to precisely identify and apply the most relevant domain knowledge for specific tasks, thereby optimizing the model’s performance and tailoring it to meet specific clinical needs. Conclusions: This research provides a basis for creating health knowledge graphs infused with physician knowledge, marking a significant step forward for PLMs in health care. Notably, the model balances integrating knowledge both comprehensively and selectively, addressing the heterogeneous nature of medical knowledge and the privacy needs of health care institutions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adapters; Data Privacy; Ehr; Electronic Health Record; Electronic Health Records; Healthcare; Healthcare Data; Healthcare Institution; Healthcare Institutions; Heterogeneous; Knowledge Integration; Medical Knowledge; Methodology; Physician; Physician Reasoning; Physicians; Pre-trained Language Models; Proprietary Information; Text Classification","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006921223"

Even when clear requirements are available for an ontology modeling endevour, many times the requirements can be solved in several different ways. Even further, when requirements change and evolve, a certain modeling style, or pattern, may no longer be the best choice. However, refactoring an ontology due to such changes in requirements, or due to the desire to align better with other external ontologies or data sets, is a complex and tedious process, also requiring extensive expertise. Attempting to automate part of the ontology transformation process, by identifying typical transformation patterns, and creating tool support for their semi-automated application, is therefore an important research topic. One specific sub-task of such automation is the naming of new entities (e.g. classes or properties) that are generated through the pattern application.

Our work evaluates the capabilities of LLMs in ontology learning in the context of highly specialized and complex domains such as life science domains.

While LLMs excel in static text classification tasks, they struggle in real-time scenarios where news topics and narratives evolve rapidly. The dynamic nature of news, with frequent introductions of new concepts and events, challenges pre-trained models, which often fail to adapt quickly to changes. Additionally, the potential of ontology-based semantic enrichment to enhance model adaptability in these contexts has been underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose a novel supervised news classification system that incorporates semantic enrichment to enhance real-time adaptability. This approach bridges the gap between static language models and the dynamic nature of modern newsrooms. The system operates on an adaptive prequential learning framework, continuously assessing model performance on incoming data streams to simulate real-time newsroom decision-making. It supports diverse content formats - text, images, audio, and video - and multiple languages, aligning with the demands of digital journalism. We explore three strategies for deploying LLMs in this dynamic environment: using pre-trained models directly, fine-tuning classifier layers while freezing the initial layers to accommodate new data, and continuously fine-tuning the entire model using real-time feedback combined with data selected based on specified criteria to enhance adaptability and learning over time. These approaches are evaluated incrementally as new data is introduced, reflecting real-time news cycles. Our findings demonstrate that ontology-based semantic enrichment consistently improves classification performance, enabling models to adapt effectively to emerging topics and evolving contexts. This study highlights the critical role of semantic enrichment, prequential evaluation, and continuous learning in building robust and adaptive news classification systems capable of thriving in the rapidly evolving digital news landscape. By augmenting news content with third-party ontology-based knowledge, our system provides deeper contextual understanding, enabling LLMs to navigate emerging topics and shifting narratives more effectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Llm; News Classification; Nlp; Semantic Enrichment; Supervised Online Learning; Labeled Data; Language Model; Large Language Model; News Classification; Online Learning; Online News; Ontology-based; Real- Time; Semantic Enrichment; Supervised Online Learning; Text Classification; Supervised Learning","Labeled data; Language model; Large language model; News classification; Online learning; Online news; Ontology-based; Real- time; Semantic enrichment; Supervised online learning; Text classification; Supervised learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006892349"

In such a scenario, we face the challenges of word sense disambiguation (WSD), multiword expressions (MWE), and multilinguality (of models and content) in the retrieval process. For WSD and MWE, there is a need for contextual knowledge to differentiate word senses of expressions in the content. For multilinguality, we aim for systems which support content that comes in a mix of languages, as well as querying across languages. To support both goals, we propose a combination of knowledge models, multilingual linguistic data (including lexicographic resources) and large language models (LLMs). Via dictionaries with additional lexical information for multiple languages, we implement cross-language queries, and with the integration of LLMs we use these quality language resources to drive multilingual disambiguation for Graph RAG systems.

Due to the specification of theme-specific documents, these NER models are considerably hard to identify potential theme-specific entities. To address this challenge, we propose an effective two-stage approach of masked theme-specific NER associated with Large Language Models (LLMs), which uses the unsupervised mechanism rather than the supervised one. The approach involves theme-specific entity ontology construction and masked NER in heterogeneous documents. The first stage is associated with LLMs and Wikipedia category pages, and the second one is implemented with the masked NER based on the created ontology in the first stage. Extensive experimental results suggest that the proposed masked NER can precisely locate the known entities in the theme-specific entity ontology while improving the accuracy of NER in the remaining text. Compared to the mainstream NER frameworks such as spaCy 3, the masked NER can identify more valid entities in the input Markdown text and continuously use the newly detected unknown entities to update the created ontology. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Heterogeneous Documents; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Theme-specific Entity Ontology; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Heterogeneous Documents; Language Model; Language Processing; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Ontology's; Recognition Models; Theme-specific Entity Ontology; Ontology","Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Heterogeneous documents; Language model; Language processing; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology's; Recognition models; Theme-specific entity ontology; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002040147"

ABM represents subsystems and their entities as agents while employing flexible rules to describe complex relationships and interactions among the agents. The Metaverse, with its sophisticated agents like digital twins (DTs) and human digital twins (HDTs), can significantly boost ABM performance. However, current cognitive architectures are not ready for HDTs use in the Metaverse. Here we show that extending current digital cognitive architectures is a crucial first step towards building more robust HDTs. We introduce Cybonto, a novel ontology that packages 108 psychology constructs and thousands of related paths based on 20 time-tested psychology theories. Using 20 network science centrality algorithms, we rank the Cybonto psychology constructs by their influences, identifying the top 10 constructs: behavior, arousal, goals, perception, self-efficacy, circumstances, evaluating, behavior-controllability, knowledge, and intentional modality. These findings confirm the need for specific extensions of current digital cognitive architectures in preparation for future HDTs in the Metaverse. Additionally, Cybonto can be used to develop cognitive evaluation metrics for large language models, moving the field forward in terms of practical applications and theoretical advancements. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agent-based Modeling; Cognitive Computing; Human Digital Twins; Metaverse; Smart Agents","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001780564"

In this paper, a novel framework for product recommendation is proposed by integrating large language models jointly with deep learning. The contribution of large language models is that it adds semantic understanding capability to the predictive power provided through neural networks. Domain ontologies will be used in this hybrid model to enhance the accuracy and personalization of recommendations, considering complex user preferences and product attributes in e-commerce platforms. It takes a state-of-the-art pre-trained LLM, such as Llama-3, as input and generates personalized embeddings of users based on history, item descriptions, and contextual information. In this work, the Transformer architecture has been used in re-fining and ranking the products for relevance using attention mechanisms that select the most important features in each recommendation task. Besides, knowledge distillation will be used to conduct the small and efficient student model training process. The distilled model receives soft predictions that involve the teacher LLM, which greatly reduces computational overhead but preserves high recommendation accuracy.

The selection of evaluation metrics in IR depends on specific tasks, relevant standards, and desired characteristics. To thoroughly assess an IR system's performance, a combination of metrics is necessary. This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in semantic and personalized information retrieval (SIR), focusing on BERT and other large language models (LLMs) that provide context-sensitive embeddings and advanced language comprehension capabilities. Through a detailed analysis, this paper demonstrates how DL models can significantly enhance accuracy and relevance in IR, using evaluation metrics critical for assessing model performance. Metrics like recall, precision, and F1-score are key in capturing model accuracy and coverage; for example, a recall of 1.0 indicates complete retrieval of relevant instances, while a precision of 0.6 reflects a 60% accuracy in positive predictions, balancing these measures at an F1-score of 46.15%. Ranking and prioritization metrics, such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), evaluated at 91.67% and 95.1%, respectively highlight the models' capabilities in prioritizing relevant results effectively. In personalized and semantic search, selecting the right evaluation metrics is essential to maximize DL model potential and improve the user experience. Recent LLM advancements, like GPT-4, are instrumental in capturing nuanced meanings and understanding complex user queries, which enhances the accuracy of search engines. Continuous optimization of these models through tailored metrics can improve IR systems' contextual relevance and accuracy, fostering greater user satisfaction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Deep Learning Models; Evaluation; Metrics; Ontology; Personalized Ir; Semantic Ir; Transformer Models; User Profiling; Adversarial Machine Learning; Data Accuracy; Deep Learning; Deep Reinforcement Learning; Federated Learning; Information Retrieval; Semantics; Bert; Deep Learning Model; Evaluation; Learning Models; Metric; Ontology's; Personalized Information Retrieval; Semantic Information Retrieval; Transformer Modeling; User's Profiling; Contrastive Learning","Adversarial machine learning; Data accuracy; Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Federated learning; Information retrieval; Semantics; BERT; Deep learning model; Evaluation; Learning models; Metric; Ontology's; Personalized information retrieval; Semantic information retrieval; Transformer modeling; User's profiling; Contrastive Learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001342750"

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Agents; Artificial Intelligence; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing; Non-negative Tensor Factorization; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Topic Modeling; Anomaly Detection; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Non-negative Matrix Factorization; Ontology; Photomapping; Problem Oriented Languages; Question Answering; Domain Specific; Knowledge Graphs; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Non Negatives; Non-negative Tensor Factorization; Retrieval Augmented Generation; Tensor Factorization; Topic Modeling; Tensors","Anomaly detection; Domain Knowledge; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Non-negative matrix factorization; Ontology; Photomapping; Problem oriented languages; Question answering; Domain specific; Knowledge graphs; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Non negatives; Non-negative tensor factorization; Retrieval augmented generation; Tensor factorization; Topic Modeling; Tensors","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000862118"

The system is implemented by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with computer vision to detect and provide detailed information about drugs from pill images.

Then, the Google Gemini LLM model is customized by using binary values of the image, target language, and ontology-based prompt engineering. As a result, the LLM model provides drug descriptions in text. Then, the textual description of the drug is converted into the target language audio format by using the Google Text to Speech Converter.

Traditional methods, often reliant on costly and time-consuming experimental approaches, further complicate rapid innovation. Addressing these challenges, the integration of artificial intelligence with materials science has opened avenues for accelerating the discovery process, though it also demands precise annotation, data extraction, and traceability of information. To tackle these issues, this article introduces the Materials Knowledge Graph (MKG), which utilizes advanced natural language processing techniques integrated with large language models to extract and systematically organize a decade's worth of high-quality research into structured triples, contains 162,605 nodes and 731,772 edges. MKG categorizes information into comprehensive labels such as Name, Formula, and Application, structured around a meticulously designed ontology, thus enhancing data usability and integration. By implementing network-based algorithms, MKG not only facilitates efficient link prediction but also significantly reduces reliance on traditional experimental methods. This structured approach not only streamlines materials research but also lays the groundwork for more sophisticated science knowledge graphs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000530840"

To tackle these challenges, we introduce ProtGO, a unified model that harnesses a teacher network equipped with a customized graph neural network (GNN) and a Gene Ontology (GO) encoder to learn hybrid embeddings. Notably, our approach eliminates the need for additional functions as input for the student network, which shares the same GNN module. Importantly, we utilize a domain adaptation method to facilitate distribution approximation for guiding the training of the teacher-student framework. This approach leverages distributions learned from latent representations to avoid the alignment of individual samples. Benchmark experiments highlight that ProtGO significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, clearly demonstrating the advantages of the proposed unified framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000508851"

Yet, constructing ontologies requires substantial manual effort. To automate part of this process, large language models (LLMs) have been applied to solve various subtasks of ontology learning. However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to the ground truth. In contrast to standard syntax-based metrics, our metrics use deep learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs. Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. We further demonstrate that our model can be effectively adapted to new domains, like arXiv, needing only a small number of training examples.

These different database models have a big impact on query complexity and performance. While this has been a known fact in database research, its implications for the growing number of Text-to-Query systems have surprisingly not been investigated so far. In this paper, we present SM3-Text-to-Query, the first multi-model medical Text-to-Query benchmark based on synthetic patient data from Synthea, following the SNOMED-CT taxonomy-a widely used knowledge graph ontology covering medical terminology. SM3-Text-to-Query provides data representations for relational databases (PostgreSQL), document stores (MongoDB), and graph databases (Neo4j and GraphDB (RDF)), allowing the evaluation across four popular query languages, namely SQL, MQL, Cypher, and SPARQL. We systematically and manually develop 408 template questions, which we augment to construct a benchmark of 10K diverse natural language question/query pairs for these four query languages (40K pairs overall). On our dataset, we evaluate several common in-context-learning (ICL) approaches for a set of representative closed and open-source LLMs. Our evaluation sheds light on the trade-offs between database models and query languages for different ICL strategies and LLMs. Last, SM3-Text-to-Query is easily extendable to additional query languages or real, standard-based patient databases. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000461190"

Despite the reported success, little effort has been put into evaluating the musical knowledge of Large Language Models (LLM). In this paper, we demonstrate that LLMs suffer from 1) prompt sensitivity, 2) inability to model negation (e.g. “rock song without guitar”), and 3) sensitivity towards the presence of specific words. We quantified these properties as a triplet-based accuracy, evaluating the ability to model the relative similarity of labels in a hierarchical ontology. We leveraged the Audioset ontology to generate triplets consisting of an anchor, a positive (relevant) label, and a negative (less relevant) label for the genre and instruments sub-tree. We evaluated the triplet-based musical knowledge for six general-purpose Transformer-based models. The triplets obtained through this methodology required filtering, as some were difficult to judge and therefore relatively uninformative for evaluation purposes. Despite the relatively high accuracy reported, inconsistencies are evident in all six models, suggesting that off-the-shelf LLMs need adaptation to music before use. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computer Music; Musical Instruments; Trees (mathematics); Audio Retrieval; Information Research; Language Model; Multimodal System; Music Information; Music Understanding; New Approaches; Ontology's; Research Applications; Rock Song; Ontology","Computer music; Musical instruments; Trees (mathematics); Audio retrieval; Information research; Language model; Multimodal system; Music information; Music understanding; New approaches; Ontology's; Research applications; Rock song; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000198786"

The relationship between product assurance effort, mission risk and total mission costs are well understood (Wertz et al [1]). International Space Engineering Standards such as NASA’s NPR series, NASA centre guides, and ECSS exist to codify known best practices [2, 3]. These may or may not be complied to, depending on the risk, schedule and budget appetite of mission stakeholders [4].

However, when applied in video retrieval, traditional contrastive learning strategies have faced challenges in achieving satisfactory results due to redundancy of video contents. We discern several potential reasons: (1)Current methodologies sometimes overlook the significant information imbalance between videos and query text, specifically neglecting the in-depth textual representation of the content within the videos. (2) Current video matching methodologies typically focus on cross-model alignment at general entity similarity level, without specific consideration for how entity pair preferences and similarity properties affect the task at hand. (3) Previous vectorized retrieval based on video content features have been somewhat flawed. They primarily focused on aligning overall features without having an video content tags feature for meaningful feature discrimination. Considering the shortcomings identified in the mentioned three aspects, we propose an ontology semantic labels augments retrieval model and introduce a method to integrate video ontology semantic labels into the contrastive learning framework. In particular, we have developed ontology semantic descriptions about entities encompassing both human figures and textual elements within the videos. Subsequently, we conducted training and testing on the CMIVQA dataset to assess the performance of our approach. The experimental results show that employing fine-grained ontology labels as sample pairs for contrastive learning leads to an increased level of precision in video retrieval tasks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Multimodal Alignment; Ontology Description; Video Content Understanding; Alignment; Image Retrieval; Learning Systems; Semantics; Statistical Tests; Video Recording; 'current; Multi-modal; Multimodal Alignment; Ontology Description; Ontology Semantics; Ontology's; Performance; Video Content Understanding; Video Contents; Video Retrieval; Ontology","Alignment; Image retrieval; Learning systems; Semantics; Statistical tests; Video recording; 'current; Multi-modal; Multimodal alignment; Ontology description; Ontology semantics; Ontology's; Performance; Video content understanding; Video contents; Video retrieval; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188340399"

This task plays a crucial role in many downstream tasks and applications in academia and industry. Since manually aligning ontologies is inefficient and costly, numerous approaches exist to do this automatically. However, most approaches are tailored to specific domains, are rule-based systems or based on feature engineering, and require external knowledge. The most recent advances in the field of OA rely on the widely proven effectiveness of pre-trained language models to represent the human-generated language that describes the entities in an ontology. However, these approaches additionally require sophisticated algorithms or Graph Neural Networks to exploit an ontology's graphical structure to achieve state-of-the-art performance. In this work, we present NLFOA, or Natural Language Focused Ontology Alignment, which purely focuses on the natural language contained in ontologies to process the ontology's semantics as well as graphical structure. An evaluation of our approach on common OA datasets shows superior results when finetuning with only a small number of training samples.

Operationalizing the BSM into research and clinical care is challenging because most investigators work in silos that concentrate on only one or two BSM domains. Furthermore, the expanding, multidisciplinary nature of BSM research creates practical limitations as to how individual investigators integrate current data into their processes of generating impactful hypotheses. The rapidly advancing field of artificial intelligence (AI) is providing new tools for organizing knowledge, but the practical aspects for how AI may advance LBP research and clinical are beginning to be explored. The goals of the work presented here are to: (1) explore the current capabilities of knowledge integration technologies (large language models (LLM), similarity graphs (SGs), and knowledge graphs (KGs)) to synthesize biomedical literature and depict multimodal relationships reflected in the BSM, and; (2) highlight limitations, implementation details, and future areas of research to improve performance. We demonstrate preliminary evidence that LLMs, like GPT-3, may be useful in helping scientists analyze and distinguish cLBP publications across multiple BSM domains and determine the degree to which the literature supports or contradicts emergent hypotheses. We show that SG representations and KGs enable exploring LBP's literature in novel ways, possibly providing, trans-disciplinary perspectives or insights that are currently difficult, if not infeasible to achieve. The SG approach is automated, simple, and inexpensive to execute, and thereby may be useful for early-phase literature and narrative explorations beyond one's areas of expertise. Likewise, we show that KGs can be constructed using automated pipelines, queried to provide semantic information, and analyzed to explore trans-domain linkages. The examples presented support the feasibility for LBP-tailored AI protocols to organize knowledge and support developing and refining trans-domain hypotheses. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Biopsychosocial Model; Chronic Low Back Pain; Knowledge Graphs; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Biopsychosocial Model; Chronic Pain; Data Classification; Human; Hypothesis; Information Processing; Interdisciplinary Research; Knowledge; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Model; Low Back Pain; Medical Literature; Musculoskeletal System; Ontology; Preliminary Data; Scientist; Similarity Graph","Article; artificial intelligence; biopsychosocial model; chronic pain; data classification; human; hypothesis; information processing; interdisciplinary research; knowledge; knowledge graph; large language model; low back pain; medical literature; musculoskeletal system; ontology; preliminary data; scientist; similarity graph","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177452510"

Extensive evaluations showed that protein representations using the domain embeddings are superior to those of large-scale protein language models in GO prediction tasks.

These models are driven by diverse retrieval mechanisms that offer varying similarity calculations and directly influence the final result ranking. However, despite decades of work due to technical constraints, deep semantic analysis has been challenging. This gap emphasizes the importance of a precise semantic understanding of information acquisition through learning approaches. Based on the above opening, this paper establishes a fast retrieval model of English sentences based on the statistical language model (SLM). First, the proposed method utilizes SLM to extract significant feature words from the corpus. These feature words are identified by analyzing co-occurrence patterns and frequency distributions within the standard. Second, it employs the N-gram model to calculate the probabilities of word occurrences based on their contextual dependencies. This framework represents feature words and their associated probabilities in a structured manner by capturing the intricate nuances of language semantics. Third, the model integrates ontology to bridge the gap between human language and machine understanding by enabling the mapping natural language expressions to conceptual entities. Finally, the suggested model retrieves English sentences through semantic matching by leveraging the comprehensive semantic framework and ontology-based search. The experimental study revealed that the proposed model demonstrated an impressive retrieval ratio of 98.5% by outperforming existing models in the comparison. Moreover, these results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) algorithm, and the accuracy of this algorithm is improved by 7.52% compared with TF-IDF. When the labelled corpus is very small and the unlabeled corpus is relatively large, the algorithm enhances the classifier’s performance by 12.6%. This shows that the algorithm used in this paper reduces the influence of the synonym processing stage on the overall performance while retaining the advantages of high precision and accuracy of calculation results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","English Sentences; Machine Learning; N-gram Model; Quick Retrieval; Semantic Similarity; Tf-idf Algorithm; Computational Linguistics; Learning Algorithms; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Text Processing; English Sentences; Feature Words; Frequency Algorithms; Machine-learning; N-gram Models; Quick Retrieval; Retrieval Models; Semantic Similarity; Term Frequency-inverse Document Frequency Algorithm; Term Frequencyinverse Document Frequency (tf-idf); Machine Learning","Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Text processing; English sentences; Feature words; Frequency algorithms; Machine-learning; N-gram models; Quick retrieval; Retrieval models; Semantic similarity; Term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Machine learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171833456"

Employing that for knowledge-driven NLP tasks such as gene-disease association prediction represents a promising way to increase the predictive power of a model. Methods: We investigated the power of infusing the embedding of two aligned ontologies as prior knowledge to the NLP models. We evaluated the performance of different models on some large-scale gene-disease association datasets and compared it with a model without incorporating contextualized knowledge (BERT). Results: The experiments demonstrated that the knowledge-infused model slightly outperforms BERT by creating a small number of bridges. Thus, indicating that incorporating cross-references across ontologies can enhance the performance of base models without the need for more complex and costly training. However, further research is needed to explore the generalizability of the model. We expected that adding more bridges would bring further improvement based on the trend we observed in the experiments. In addition, the use of state-of-the-art knowledge graph embedding methods on a joint graph from connecting OGG and DOID with bridges also yielded promising results. Conclusion: Our work shows that allowing language models to leverage structured knowledge from ontologies does come with clear advantages in the performance.

To address the shortcomings of existing language models (such as Word2vec and Glove) that cannot solve polysemous words and have a poor ability to fuse contexts, we propose a geological named entity recognition and relationship extraction model jointly with Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT) pretrained language model.

The results show that the F1-score of the BERT-BiGRU-CRF named entity recognition model is 0.91 and the F1-score of the BERT-BiGRU-Attention relationship extraction model is 0.84, which are significant performance improvements when compared to classic language models (e.g., word2vec and Embedding from Language Models (ELMo)). © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert Model; Knowledge Graph; Name Entity Recognition; Ontology; Relation Extraction; Hazard Assessment; Knowledge Based System; Language; Mineralization; Prediction","hazard assessment; knowledge based system; language; mineralization; prediction","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174464909"

Nevertheless, mapping concepts to ontologies is often done with generic tools and is labor-intensive. Contextualizing candidate concepts within source data is also done in an ad hoc manner. Methods and Results: We present AnnoDash, a flexible dashboard to support annotation of concepts with terms from a given ontology. Text-based similarity is used to identify likely matches, and large language models are used to improve ontology ranking. A convenient interface is provided to visualize observations associated with a concept, supporting the disambiguation of vague concept descriptions. Time-series plots contrast the concept with known clinical measurements. We evaluated the dashboard qualitatively against several ontologies (SNOMED CT, LOINC, etc.) by using MIMIC-IV measurements. The dashboard is web-based and step-by-step instructions for deployment are provided, simplifying usage for nontechnical audiences.

It covers more than 5000 terms hierarchically organized into a directed acyclic graph and known functional annotations. Automatically annotating protein functions by using GO-based computational models has been an area of active research for a long time. However, due to the limited functional annotation information and complex topological structures of GO, existing models cannot effectively capture the knowledge representation of GO. To solve this issue, we present a method that fuses the functional and topological knowledge of GO to guide protein function prediction. This method employs a multi-view GCN model to extract a variety of GO representations from functional information, topological structure, and their combinations. To dynamically learn the significance weights of these representations, it adopts an attention mechanism to learn the final knowledge representation of GO. Furthermore, it uses a pre-trained language model (i.e., ESM-1b) to efficiently learn biological features for each protein sequence. Finally, it obtains all predicted scores by calculating the dot product of sequence features and GO representation. Our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated by the experimental results on datasets from three different species, namely Yeast, Human and Arabidopsis.

Prediction by machine learning techniques such as contextual semantic embedding is a promising direction, but the relevant research is still preliminary especially for expressive ontologies in Web Ontology Language (OWL). In this paper, we present a new subsumption prediction method named BERTSubs for classes of OWL ontology. It exploits the pre-trained language model BERT to compute contextual embeddings of a class, where customized templates are proposed to incorporate the class context (e.g., neighbouring classes) and the logical existential restriction. BERTSubs is able to predict multiple kinds of subsumers including named classes from the same ontology or another ontology, and existential restrictions from the same ontology. Extensive evaluation on five real-world ontologies for three different subsumption tasks has shown the effectiveness of the templates and that BERTSubs can dramatically outperform the baselines that use (literal-aware) knowledge graph embeddings, non-contextual word embeddings and the state-of-the-art OWL ontology embeddings. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Ontology Alignment; Ontology Embedding; Owl; Pre-trained Language Model; Subsumption Prediction; Artificial Intelligence; Birds; Computational Linguistics; Embeddings; Ontology; Semantics; Bert; Language Model; Ontology Alignment; Ontology Embedding; Ontology In Web Ontology Language; Ontology's; Pre-trained Language Model; Subsumption Prediction; Web Ontology Language (owl); Forecasting","Artificial intelligence; Birds; Computational linguistics; Embeddings; Ontology; Semantics; BERT; Language model; Ontology alignment; Ontology embedding; Ontology in web ontology language; Ontology's; Pre-trained language model; Subsumption prediction; Web ontology language (OWL); Forecasting","Article","Final","All Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85156109122"

The majority of existing PPI research has relied mainly on sequence-based approaches. With the availability of multi-omics datasets (sequence, 3D structure) and advancements in deep learning techniques, it is feasible to develop a deep multi-modal framework that fuses the features learned from different sources of information to predict PPI. In this work, we propose a multi-modal approach utilizing protein sequence and 3D structure. To extract features from the 3D structure of proteins, we use a pre-trained vision transformer model that has been fine-tuned on the structural representation of proteins. The protein sequence is encoded into a feature vector using a pre-trained language model. The feature vectors extracted from the two modalities are fused and then fed to the neural network classifier to predict the protein interactions. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we conduct experiments on two popular PPI datasets, namely, the human dataset and the S. cerevisiae dataset. Our approach outperforms the existing methodologies to predict PPI, including multi-modal approaches. We also evaluate the contributions of each modality by designing uni-modal baselines. We perform experiments with three modalities as well, having gene ontology as the third modality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Language Model; Protein-protein Interaction; Vision Transformer; Protein; Proteins; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Gene Ontology; Three Dimensional Displays; 3d Structure; Amino-acids; Features Extraction; Language Model; Protein Sequences; Protein-protein Interactions; Three-dimensional Display; Transformer; Vision Transformer; Proteins; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Artificial Neural Network; Chemistry; Human; Metabolism; Multiomics; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Amino Acid Sequence; Humans; Multiomics; Neural Networks, Computer","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Forecasting; Gene Ontology; Three dimensional displays; 3D Structure; Amino-acids; Features extraction; Language model; Protein sequences; Protein-protein interactions; Three-dimensional display; Transformer; Vision transformer; Proteins; protein; amino acid sequence; artificial neural network; chemistry; human; metabolism; multiomics; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Amino Acid Sequence; Humans; Multiomics; Neural Networks, Computer","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149378413"

This task has considerably benefited from pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, when it comes to the trigger-word mismatch problem in languages without natural delimiters, existing methods ignore the complement of lexical information to BERT. In addition, the inherent multi-role noise problem could limit the performance of methods when one sentence contains multiple events. In this article, we propose a Mask-Attention-based BERT (MABERT) framework for Chinese event extraction to address the above problems. Firstly, in order to avoid trigger-word mismatch and integrate lexical features into BERT layers directly, a mask-attention-based transformer augmented with two mask matrices is devised to replace the original one in BERT. By the mask-attention-based transformer, the character sequence interacts with external lexical semantics sufficiently and keeps its structure information at the same time. Moreover, against the multi-role noise problem, we make use of event type information from representation and classification, two aspects to enrich entity features, where type markers and event-schema-based mask matrix are proposed. Experimental results on the widely used ACE2005 dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed MABERT on Chinese event extraction task compared with other state-of-the-art methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Additional Key Words And Phrasesevent Extraction; Event Ontology; Event Type Markers; Mask-attention-based Transformer; Classification (of Information); Semantics; Additional Key Word And Phrasesevent Extraction; Event Ontology; Event Type Marker; Event Types; Events Extractions; Key Words; Language Model; Mask-attention-based Transformer; Matrix; Noise Problems; Noise Pollution","Classification (of information); Semantics; Additional key word and phrasesevent extraction; Event ontology; Event type marker; Event Types; Events extractions; Key words; Language model; Mask-attention-based transformer; matrix; Noise problems; Noise pollution","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85167671193"

Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, pre-trained language models have thus far only enabled modest improvements to the quality of such concept embeddings. Current strategies for using language models typically represent a concept by averaging the contextualised representations of its mentions in some corpus. This is potentially sub-optimal for at least two reasons. First, contextualised word vectors have an unusual geometry, which hampers downstream tasks. Second, concept embeddings should capture the semantic properties of concepts, whereas contextualised word vectors are also affected by other factors. To address these issues, we propose two contrastive learning strategies, based on the view that whenever two sentences reveal similar properties, the corresponding contextualised vectors should also be similar. One strategy is fully unsupervised, estimating the properties which are expressed in a sentence from the neighbourhood structure of the contextualised word embeddings. The second strategy instead relies on a distant supervision signal from ConceptNet. Our experimental results show that the resulting vectors substantially outperform existing concept embeddings in predicting the semantic properties of concepts, with the ConceptNet-based strategy achieving the best results. These findings are furthermore confirmed in a clustering task and in the downstream task of ontology completion. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Commonsense Knowledge; Contrastive Learning; Language Models; Word Embedding; Computational Linguistics; Embeddings; Semantics; Commonsense Knowledge; Conceptnet; Contrastive Learning; Down-stream; Language Model; Property; Semantic Properties; Word Embedding; Word Vectors; Vectors","Computational linguistics; Embeddings; Semantics; Commonsense knowledge; ConceptNet; Contrastive learning; Down-stream; Language model; Property; Semantic properties; Word embedding; Word vectors; Vectors","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168689425"

Automated annotation of protein function at a large scale is becoming increasingly important. Existing computational prediction methods are typically based on expanding the relatively small number of experimentally determined functions to large collections of proteins with various clues, including sequence homology, protein–protein interaction, gene co-expression, etc. Although there has been some progress in protein function prediction in recent years, the development of accurate and reliable solutions still has a long way to go. Here we exploit AlphaFold predicted three-dimensional structural information, together with other non-structural clues, to develop a large-scale approach termed PredGO to annotate Gene Ontology (GO) functions for proteins. We use a pre-trained language model, geometric vector perceptrons and attention mechanisms to extract heterogeneous features of proteins and fuse these features for function prediction. The computational results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches for predicting GO functions of proteins in terms of both coverage and accuracy. The improvement of coverage is because the number of structures predicted by AlphaFold is greatly increased, and on the other hand, PredGO can extensively use non-structural information for functional prediction. Moreover, we show that over 205 000 (∼100%) entries in UniProt for human are annotated by PredGO, over 186 000 (∼90%) of which are based on predicted structure.

With the aim of improving the work of human assistants, we developed a collaborative bot (cobot) to help them in the process of handling customer voice interactions. The cobot is a reasoning agent that starts from loading background customer data into a dynamic knowledge graph. Then it captures the audio stream of the conversation, converts it to text in real time, analyzes the blocks of conversation with neural technologies and 'thinks' about the results. Assistants can also supply data to the cobot, based on the information they gather from the ongoing conversation. The reasoning agent provides information and action suggestions to the human assistant by applying heuristics on data collected from both automatic and human sources, based on a task and domain-specific conceptual models (ontologies). While designing a prototypical solution for utility services in Italy, we are faced with many problems, including spontaneous speech understanding, factual and linguistic knowledge representation, and efficient heuristic reasoning.

This adoption occurs in a context where AI is dramatically remapping ""the human,""the purposes of schooling, and pedagogy. Focus of Study: The paper examines how different formulations of ""human""became interwoven with the sliding signifier of ""intelligence""through a series of violent exclusions, and how the shifting contour of ""intelligence""produces uneven and unjust ontological scales undergirding both education and AI fields. Its purpose is to engage the education research community in dialogue about biases, the nature of ethics, and decision-making concerning AI in education. Research Design: This paper adapts a historical-philosophical method. It traces the effects of colonialism and racialization within humanism's emergence through Sylvia Wynter's historiography of ""figure of Man,""especially via the invention of ""intelligence,""which has linked education and computer science. It also investigates themes central to modern education such as justice, equity, and in/exclusion through a philosophical examination of the ontological scales of ""human.""Conclusions: After outlining how ""intelligence""has shifted from reason-as-morality to concepts of natural intelligence, we argue that current examples of AI in Education (AIEd), like classroom chatbots and social agents, constitute an intermediary point in the arc toward a new computational superintelligence-the emergence of man3- illustrating the opportunities, risks, and ethical issues in pedagogical applications based on emotion. We outline three differing visions of AIEd's future, concluding with a series of provocations (onto-epistemological, practice-based, and purposes of schooling) that exceed such models and that, given rapid innovations in machine learning, require urgent consideration from multiple stakeholders. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence (ai); Chatbot; Emotion; Figure Of Man; Intelligence","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85208671333"

One of the critical tasks in building knowledge graphs is knowledge extraction. The existing knowledge extraction models in the Chinese medical domain usually require high-quality and large-scale manually labeled corpora for model training. In this study, we investigate rheumatoid arthritis (RA)-related Chinese electronic medical records (CEMRs) and address the automatic knowledge extraction task with a small number of annotated samples from CEMRs, from which an authoritative RA knowledge graph is constructed. Methods: After constructing the domain ontology of RA and completing manual labeling, we propose the MC-bidirectional encoder representation from transformers-bidirectional long short-term memory-conditional random field (BERT-BiLSTM-CRF) model for the named entity recognition (NER) task and the MC-BERT + feedforward neural network (FFNN) model for the entity extraction task. The pretrained language model (MC-BERT) is trained with many unlabeled medical data and fine-tuned using other medical domain datasets. We apply the established model to automatically label the remaining CEMRs, and then an RA knowledge graph is constructed based on the entities and entity relations, a preliminary assessment is conducted, and an intelligent application is presented. Results: The proposed model achieved better performance than that of other widely used models in knowledge extraction tasks, with mean F1 scores of 92.96% in entity recognition and 95.29% in relation extraction. This study preliminarily confirmed that using a pretrained medical language model could solve the problem that knowledge extraction from CEMRs requires a large number of manual annotations. An RA knowledge graph based on the above identified entities and extracted relations from 1,986 CEMRs was constructed. Experts verified the effectiveness of the constructed RA knowledge graph. Conclusions: In this paper, an RA knowledge graph based on CEMRs was established, the processes of data annotation, automatic knowledge extraction, and knowledge graph construction were described, and a preliminary assessment and an application were presented. The study demonstrated the viability of a pretrained language model combined with a deep neural network for knowledge extraction tasks from CEMRs based on a small number of manually annotated samples. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Electronic Medical Records (emrs); Entity Recognition; Entity Relation Extraction; Knowledge Graph; Rheumatoid Arthritis (ra); Article; Artificial Intelligence; China; Classification Algorithm; Clinical Effectiveness; Conditional Random Field; Data Visualization; Deep Neural Network; Electronic Medical Record; Feature Extraction; Feed Forward Neural Network; Human; Information Processing; Knowledge; Knowledge Base; Knowledge Graph; Long Short Term Memory Network; Mathematical Model; Natural Language Processing; Preliminary Data; Recurrent Neural Network; Rheumatoid Arthritis; Semantics","Article; artificial intelligence; China; classification algorithm; clinical effectiveness; conditional random field; data visualization; deep neural network; electronic medical record; feature extraction; feed forward neural network; human; information processing; knowledge; knowledge base; knowledge graph; long short term memory network; mathematical model; natural language processing; preliminary data; recurrent neural network; rheumatoid arthritis; semantics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162134405"

Due to the explosive growth of proteins in sequence databases and the diversity of their functions, it remains challenging to fast and accurately predict protein functions from sequences alone. Although many methods have integrated protein structures, biological networks or literature information to improve performance, these extra features are often unavailable for most proteins. Here, we propose SPROF-GO, a Sequence-based alignment-free PROtein Function predictor, which leverages a pretrained language model to efficiently extract informative sequence embeddings and employs self-attention pooling to focus on important residues. The prediction is further advanced by exploiting the homology information and accounting for the overlapping communities of proteins with related functions through the label diffusion algorithm. SPROF-GO was shown to surpass state-of-the-art sequence-based and even network-based approaches by more than 14.5, 27.3 and 10.1% in area under the precision-recall curve on the three sub-ontology test sets, respectively. Our method was also demonstrated to generalize well on non-homologous proteins and unseen species. Finally, visualization based on the attention mechanism indicated that SPROF-GO is able to capture sequence domains useful for function prediction. The datasets, source codes and trained models of SPROF-GO are available at https://github.com/biomed-AI/SPROF-GO.

However, re-using an existing ontology for a new task requires a detailed evaluation of the candidate ontology as it may cover only a subset of the domain concepts, contain information that is redundant or misleading, and have inaccurate relations and hierarchies between concepts. Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology's concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology's relations. We demonstrate our automated approach on several large ontologies from the oceanographic domain and show its agreement with a manual evaluation by domain experts and its superiority over the state-of-the-art. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Knowledge Engineering; Natural Language Processing; Ontology; Automation; Knowledge Engineering; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Automated Evaluation; Bert; Domain Concepts; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Ontology Evaluations; Ontology's; Web Information; Web Semantics; Ontology","Automation; Knowledge engineering; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Automated evaluation; BERT; Domain concepts; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Ontology evaluations; Ontology's; Web information; Web semantics; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159640436"

It is also difficult to define all possible slots and values in advance, especially with the wide application of dialogue systems in more and more new-rising applications. In this paper, we focus on improving DST module to generate dialogue states in circumstances with limited annotations and knowledge about slot ontology. To this end, we design a dual prompt learning framework for few-shot DST. The dual framework aims to explore how to utilize the language understanding and generation capabilities of pre-trained language models for DST efficiently. Specifically, we consider the learning of slot generation and value generation as dual tasks, and two kinds of prompts are designed based on this dual structure to incorporate task-related knowledge of these two tasks respectively. In this way, the DST task can be formulated as a language modeling task efficiently under few-shot settings. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on two task-oriented dialogue datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot methods, but also can generate unseen slots. It indicates that DST-related knowledge can be probed from pre-trained language models and utilized to address low-resource DST efficiently with the help of prompt learning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dialogue State Tracking; Few-shot Learning; Prompt Learning; Learning Systems; Modeling Languages; Speech Processing; Dialog State Tracking; Dialogue Systems; Few-shot Learning; Language Model; Learning Frameworks; Prompt Learning; State Tracking; Task-oriented; Tracking Module; User Goals; Computational Linguistics","Learning systems; Modeling languages; Speech processing; Dialog state tracking; Dialogue systems; Few-shot learning; Language model; Learning frameworks; Prompt learning; State tracking; Task-oriented; Tracking module; User goals; Computational linguistics","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85159312513"

Whilst a number of ontologies exist, none of these perfectly represent the entire human phenome and exposome. Mapping trait names across large datasets is therefore time-consuming and challenging. Recent developments in language modelling have created new methods for semantic representation of words and phrases, and these methods offer new opportunities to map human trait names in the form of words and short phrases, both to ontologies and to each other. Here, we present a comparison between a range of established and more recent language modelling approaches for the task of mapping trait names from UK Biobank to the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO), and also explore how they compare to each other in direct trait-to-trait mapping. Results: In our analyses of 1191 traits from UK Biobank with manual EFO mappings, the BioSentVec model performed best at predicting these, matching 40.3% of the manual mappings correctly. The BlueBERT-EFO model (finetuned on EFO) performed nearly as well (38.8% of traits matching the manual mapping). In contrast, Levenshtein edit distance only mapped 22% of traits correctly. Pairwise mapping of traits to each other demonstrated that many of the models can accurately group similar traits based on their semantic similarity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Article; Biobank; Human; Human Experiment; Language; Ontology; Biological Ontology; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Semantics; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Semantics","article; biobank; human; human experiment; language; ontology; biological ontology; natural language processing; phenotype; semantics; Biological Ontologies; Humans; Language; Natural Language Processing; Phenotype; Semantics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85152491445"

It has a significant impact on a broad range of applications, such as question–answering systems, information retrieval, entity recognition, text analytics, sentiment classification, and so on. Despite their widespread use, many traditional machine learning techniques are incapable of identifying the semantics of short text. Traditional methods are based on ontologies, knowledge graphs, and corpus-based methods. The performance of these methods is influenced by the manually defined rules. Applying such measures is still difficult, since it poses various semantic challenges. In the existing literature, the most recent advances in short-text semantic similarity (STSS) research are not included. This study presents the systematic literature review (SLR) with the aim to (i) explain short sentence barriers in semantic similarity, (ii) identify the most appropriate standard deep learning techniques for the semantics of a short text, (iii) classify the language models that produce high-level contextual semantic information, (iv) determine appropriate datasets that are only intended for short text, and (v) highlight research challenges and proposed future improvements.

The framework automatically indexes a set of conceptual terms as research topics from the domain ontology by inputting the titles, abstracts and keywords of the papers using natural language processing techniques such as syntactic dependencies, text similarity calculation, pre-trained language models, semantic similarity calculation, and weighting factors such as word frequency statistics and graph path calculation. Finally, we evaluated the proposed method using the gold standard of manually annotated articles and demonstrated significant improvements over the other five alternative methods in terms of precision, recall and F1-score. Overall, the method proposed in this study is able to identify the research topics of academic papers more accurately, and also provides useful references for the application of domain ontologies and unsupervised data annotation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automatic Subject Indexing; Climate Change; Deep Mining; Ontology; Semantic; Academic Research; Climate Change; Conceptual Framework; Index Method; Language","academic research; climate change; conceptual framework; index method; language","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149997585"

It allows defining non-existing SNOMED CT concepts by their relationships with existing ones. Manually building postcoordinated expressions is a difficult task. It requires a deep knowledge of the terminology and the support of specialized tools that barely exist. In order to support the building of postcoordinated expressions, we have implemented KGE4SCT: a method that suggests the corresponding SNOMED CT postcoordinated expression for a given clinical term. We leverage on the SNOMED CT ontology and its graph-like structure and use knowledge graph embeddings (KGEs). The objective of such embeddings is to represent in a vector space knowledge graph components (e.g. entities and relations) in a way that captures the structure of the graph. Then, we use vector similarity and analogies for obtaining the postcoordinated expression of a given clinical term. We obtained a semantic type accuracy of 98%, relationship accuracy of 90%, and analogy accuracy of 60%, with an overall completeness of postcoordination of 52% for the Spanish SNOMED CT version. We have also applied it to the English SNOMED CT version and outperformed state of the art methods in both, corpus generation for language model training for this task (improvement of 6% for analogy accuracy), and automatic postcoordination of SNOMED CT expressions, with an increase of 17% for partial conversion rate. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Embeddings; Ontology; Postcoordination; Snomed Ct; Graph Embeddings; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Management; Semantics; Vector Spaces; Advanced Systems; Automatic Extraction; Clinical Terms; Encodings; Knowledge Graph Embedding; Knowledge Graphs; Ontology's; Postcoordination; Snomed-ct; Ontology; Article; Embedding; Human; Human Experiment; Language; Nomenclature; Ontology; Protein Expression; Systematized Nomenclature Of Medicine; Automated Pattern Recognition; Natural Language Processing; Semantics; Language; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated","Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management; Semantics; Vector spaces; Advanced systems; Automatic extraction; Clinical terms; Encodings; Knowledge graph embedding; Knowledge graphs; Ontology's; Postcoordination; SNOMED-CT; Ontology; article; embedding; human; human experiment; language; nomenclature; ontology; protein expression; Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine; automated pattern recognition; natural language processing; semantics; Language; Natural Language Processing; Pattern Recognition, Automated","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149060154"

Although many causal knowledge bases for medicine have been constructed, a comprehensive evaluation based on real-world data and methods for handling potential knowledge noise are still lacking. Objective: The objectives of our study are threefold: (1) propose a framework for the construction of a large-scale and high-quality causal knowledge graph (CKG); (2) design the methods for knowledge noise reduction to improve the quality of the CKG; (3) evaluate the knowledge completeness and accuracy of the CKG using real-world data. Material and methods: We extracted causal triples from three knowledge sources (SemMedDB, UpToDate and Churchill's Pocketbook of Differential Diagnosis) based on rule methods and language models, performed ontological encoding, and then designed semantic modeling between electronic health record (EHR) data and the CKG to complete knowledge instantiation. We proposed two graph pruning strategies (co-occurrence ratio and causality ratio) to reduce the potential noise introduced by SemMedDB. Finally, the evaluation was carried out by taking the diagnostic decision support (DDS) of diabetic nephropathy (DN) as a real-world case. The data originated from a Chinese hospital EHR system from October 2010 to October 2020. The knowledge completeness and accuracy of the CKG were evaluated based on three state-of-the-art embedding methods (R-GCN, MHGRN and MedPath), the annotated clinical text and the expert review, respectively. Results: This graph included 153,289 concepts and 1,719,968 causal triples. A total of 1427 inpatient data were used for evaluation. Better results were achieved by combining three knowledge sources than using only SemMedDB (three models: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): p < 0.01, F1: p < 0.01), and the graph covered 93.9 % of the causal relations between diseases and diagnostic evidence recorded in clinical text. Causal relations played a vital role in all relations related to disease progression for DDS of DN (three models: AUC: p > 0.05, F1: p > 0.05), and after pruning, the knowledge accuracy of the CKG was significantly improved (three models: AUC: p < 0.01, F1: p < 0.01; expert review: average accuracy: + 5.5 %). Conclusions: The results demonstrated that our proposed CKG could completely and accurately capture the abstract CK under the concrete EHR data, and the pruning strategies could improve the knowledge accuracy of our CKG. The CKG has the potential to be applied to the DDS of diseases. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Knowledge; Diabetic Nephropathy; Electronic Health Record; Knowledge Graph; Thyrotropin; Decision Support Systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Knowledge Graph; Modeling Languages; Ontology; Records Management; Semantics; Causal Knowledge; Decision Supports; Diabetic Nephropathy; Diagnostic Decisions; Electronic Health; Electronic Health Record; Health Records; Knowledge Graphs; Real-world; Three Models; Quality Control; Thyrotropin; Article; Cardiovascular Disease; Chronic Kidney Failure; Chronic Respiratory Tract Disease; Clinical Evaluation; Controlled Study; Decision Support System; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathy; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Differential Diagnosis; Disease Exacerbation; Electronic Health Record; Glomerulopathy; Human; Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Kidney Disease; Knowledge; Machine Learning; Mathematical Phenomena; Metabolic Acidosis; Natural Language Processing; Noise Reduction; Non Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sentiment Analysis; Automated Pattern Recognition; Clinical Decision Support System; Language; Semantics; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; Humans; Language; Pattern Recognition, Automated","Decision support systems; Diagnosis; Diseases; Knowledge graph; Modeling languages; Ontology; Records management; Semantics; Causal knowledge; Decision supports; Diabetic nephropathy; Diagnostic decisions; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Health records; Knowledge graphs; Real-world; Three models; Quality control; thyrotropin; Article; cardiovascular disease; chronic kidney failure; chronic respiratory tract disease; clinical evaluation; controlled study; decision support system; diabetes mellitus; diabetic nephropathy; diagnostic test accuracy study; differential diagnosis; disease exacerbation; electronic health record; glomerulopathy; human; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; kidney disease; knowledge; machine learning; mathematical phenomena; metabolic acidosis; natural language processing; noise reduction; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; receiver operating characteristic; sentiment analysis; automated pattern recognition; clinical decision support system; language; semantics; Decision Support Systems, Clinical; Diabetes Mellitus; Diabetic Nephropathies; Humans; Language; Pattern Recognition, Automated","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85147538756"

We discuss the advances and shortcomings, differences, and concordance of the models. Of note, all of the models revealed that the uncharacterized proteins in yeast tend to be less than 200 amino acids long, contain fewer aspartates and glutamates, and are enriched for cysteine. Less than half of these proteins can be annotated with GO terms with high confidence. The distribution of the cosine similarity scores of benign and pathogenic mutations to the reference human proteins shows a statistically significant difference.

With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, an abundance of proteins are discovered. However, the gap between proteins and function annotations is still huge. To accelerate the process of protein function prediction, some computational methods taking advantage of multiple data have been proposed. Among these methods, the deep-learning-based methods are currently the most popular for their capability of learning information automatically from raw data. However, due to the diversity and scale difference between data, it is challenging for existing deep learning methods to capture related information from different data effectively. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method that can adaptively learn information from protein sequences and biomedical literature, namely DeepAF. DeepAF first extracts the two kinds of information by using different extractors, which are built based on pre-trained language models and can capture rudimentary biological knowledge. Then, to integrate those information, it performs an adaptive fusion layer based on a Cross-attention mechanism that considers the knowledge of mutual interactions between two information. Finally, based on the mixed information, DeepAF utilizes logistic regression to obtain prediction scores. The experimental results on the datasets of two species (i.e., Human and Yeast) show that DeepAF outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cross-attention Mechanism; Deep Learning; Multiple Data; Pre-trained Language Models; Protein Function Prediction; Protein; Proteins; Biological Systems; Data Mining; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Http; Modeling Languages; Semantics; Amino-acids; Attention Mechanisms; Biological System Modeling; Cross-attention Mechanism; Language Model; Multiple Data; Pre-trained Language Model; Predictive Models; Protein Engineering; Protein Function Prediction; Proteins; Ablation Therapy; Accuracy; Adaptive Fusion Module; Amino Acid Sequence; Area Under The Curve; Area Under The Precision Recall Curve; Article; Biomedicine; Computer Model; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; F Max Numeric Value; Gene Ontology; High Throughput Analysis; Human; Human Versus Nonhuman Data; Logistic Regression Analysis; Molecular Genetics; Nonhuman; Protein Function; Receiver Operating Characteristic; Sequence Homology; Statistical Concepts; Yeast; Metabolism; Saccharomyces Cerevisiae; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Humans","Biological systems; Data mining; Deep learning; Forecasting; HTTP; Modeling languages; Semantics; Amino-acids; Attention mechanisms; Biological system modeling; Cross-attention mechanism; Language model; Multiple data; Pre-trained language model; Predictive models; Protein engineering; Protein function prediction; Proteins; ablation therapy; accuracy; adaptive fusion module; amino acid sequence; area under the curve; area under the precision recall curve; Article; biomedicine; computer model; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; f max numeric value; gene ontology; high throughput analysis; human; human versus nonhuman data; logistic regression analysis; molecular genetics; nonhuman; protein function; receiver operating characteristic; sequence homology; statistical concepts; yeast; metabolism; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Humans","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142828087"

Unlike chit-chat dialogue models, task-oriented dialogue models fulfill at least two task-specific modules: Dialogue state tracker (DST) and response generator (RG). The dialogue state consists of the domain-slot-value triples, which are regarded as the user’s constraints to search the domain-related databases. The large-scale task-oriented dialogue data with the annotated structured dialogue state usually are inacces-sible. It prevents the development of the pretrained language model for the task-oriented dialogue. We propose a simple yet effective pretraining method to alleviate this problem, which consists of two pretraining phases. The first phase is to pretrain on large-scale contextual text data, where the structured information of the text is extracted by the information extracting tool. To bridge the gap between the pretraining method and downstream tasks, we design two pretraining tasks: ontology-like triple recovery and next-text generation, which simulates the DST and RG, respectively. The second phase is to fine-tune the pretrained model on the TOD data. The experimental re-sults show that our proposed method achieves an exciting boost and obtains competitive performance even without any TOD data on CamRest676 and MultiWOZ benchmarks. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benchmarking; Bridges; Computational Linguistics; Dialogue Models; End-to-end Task; Language Model; Large-scales; Modeling Task; Ontology's; Pre-training; Simple++; Task-oriented; Task-specific Modules; Ontology","Benchmarking; Bridges; Computational linguistics; Dialogue models; End-to-end task; Language model; Large-scales; Modeling task; Ontology's; Pre-training; Simple++; Task-oriented; Task-specific modules; Ontology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146952463"

Automatically solving ageWPs is a challenging task as we need to tackle temporal relationships between the agent's ages, frame and solve the equations for the required unknowns. To the best of our knowledge, there exists only one ageWP dataset consisting of just 124 examples. The dataset is too small to employ a learning-based solver, mainly consisting of ageWPs with simple temporal relationships. To address this issue, in our earlier work, we designed a description-logic based ontology (ageWP-ont) for the domain of age word problems and utilized it to automatically generate a large number of ageWPs. Sentences in these ageWPs relate the ages of agents in a temporally complex manner. In this paper, we focus on solving these problems. We analyzed an existing learning-based solver of algebraic word-problems that uses a traditional machine learning approach and found that the solver can be adapted to our domain. But we found that this approach does not seem to perform well, perhaps due to the complex nature of the ageWPs. As we have the ontology of the domain on hand, we propose a new approach of utilizing it in the deep-learning based NLU component of the solution. We annotate parts of the ageWP sentences with class-names from ageWP-ont and train a BERT-based language model (LM) that learns to predict the instances for these classes in the given sentences. An RDF graph is populated with these values and serves as a concrete problem-specific instance of the ontology. The dataset for training the LM is automatically generated with the help of ageWP-ont. Finally, for the actual solving of a given ageWP, we make use of its RDF graph and employ Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We implemented the proposed system and achieved 68.8% accuracy. The work demonstrates that combining deep learning with ontologies can give impressive results. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Age-word Problem Solver; Bert; Owl-dl Ontology; Swrl; Data Description; Deep Learning; Resource Description Framework (rdf); Age-word Problem Solv; Bert; Ontology's; Owl-dl Ontology; Problem Solvers; Rules Languages; Semantic Web Rule Language; Semantic Web Rules; Temporal Relationships; Word Problem; Ontology","Data description; Deep learning; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Age-word problem solv; BERT; Ontology's; OWL-DL ontology; Problem solvers; Rules languages; Semantic web rule language; Semantic Web rules; Temporal relationships; Word problem; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146150779"

To mitigate this issue, we propose a low-cost and effective knowledge-enhanced method to facilitate domain-specific semantics modeling in joint entity and relation extraction. Precisely, we use ontology and entity type descriptions as domain knowledge sources, which are encoded and incorporated into the downstream entity and relation extraction model to improve its understanding of domain-specific information.

The primary goal of the approach is to increase the efficiency of support processes during the life cycle of general-purpose software systems. The book is structured in seven chapters. Chapter 1 presents the objectives and significance of the research, as well as a summary of the contents of the work. Chapter 2 analyses the existing classical DSL design and implementation methodology for modelling human-machine interfaces in the context of the lifecycle of general-purpose software systems. Next, chapter 3 is devoted to an analysis of existing methods and formalisms used in describing the structure of a DSL for modelling human-machine interfaces of software systems. Subsequently, chapter 4 provides a detailed description of the proposed new projection-based approach for developing such DSLs. Chapter 5 then describes the software implementation of the human-machine interface evolution based on an example of an external DSL in two domains. Eventually, chapter 6 analyses the application of the proposed projection approach for more complex systems, namely, decision support systems based on heterogeneous information of decision makers. The concluding chapter 7 summarizes the main results of the research and suggests further development paths and practical applications.

Predictions for the masks were evaluated in two different test sets. Results achieved by the monolingual models are interesting enough for considering these models as a source for enriching wordnets, especially when predicting hypernyms of nouns. Previously reported performances on prediction were improved with new patterns and with the large model.

Can we define the amount of contextualized concept forming needed given the abstracted representation of a word? Specifically, we consider samples of words with different polysemy profiles shared across three languages, assuming that words with a different polysemy profile require a different degree of concept shaping by context. We conduct probing experiments to investigate the impact of prior polysemy profiles on the representation in different layers.

Recent research in explainability has focused on explaining the workings of AI models or model explainability. There have also been several position statements and review papers detailing the needs of end-users for user-centered explainability but fewer implementations. Hence, this thesis seeks to bridge some gaps between model and user-centered explainability. We create an explanation ontology (EO) to represent literature-derived explanation types via their supporting components. We implement a knowledge-augmented question-answering (QA) pipeline to support contextual explanations in a clinical setting. Finally, we are implementing a system to combine explanations from different AI methods and data modalities. Within the EO, we can represent fifteen different explanation types, and we have tested these representations in six exemplar use cases. We find that knowledge augmentations improve the performance of base large language models in the contextualized QA, and the performance is variable across disease groups. In the same setting, clinicians also indicated that they prefer to see actionability as one of the main foci in explanations. In our explanations combination method, we plan to use similarity metrics to determine the similarity of explanations in a chronic disease detection setting. Overall, through this thesis, we design methods that can support knowledge-enabled explanations across different use cases, accounting for the methods in today's AI era that can generate the supporting components of these explanations and domain knowledge sources that can enhance them. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Explainable Ai; Knowledge-enabled Explanations; User-centered Explanations; Domain Knowledge; Natural Language Processing Systems; User Interfaces; Artificial Intelligence Systems; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Knowledge-enabled Explanation; Ontology's; Performance; Question Answering; Recent Researches; User Knowledge; User-centered Explanation; User-centred; Ontology","Domain Knowledge; Natural language processing systems; User interfaces; Artificial intelligence systems; Explainable artificial intelligence; Knowledge-enabled explanation; Ontology's; Performance; Question Answering; Recent researches; User knowledge; User-centered explanation; User-centred; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85192738787"

This allows them to create a mental map of the environment, allowing them to navigate on-demand when given linguistic instructions. A natural goal in Vision Language Navigation (VLN) research is to impart autonomous agents with similar capabilities. Recent works take a step towards this goal by creating a semantic spatial map representation of the environment without any labeled data. However, their representations are limited for practical applicability as they do not distinguish between different instances of the same object. In this work, we address this limitation by integrating instance-level information into spatial map representation using a community detection algorithm and utilizing word ontology learned by large language models (LLMs) to perform open-set semantic associations in the mapping representation. The resulting map representation improves the navigation performance by two-fold (233%) on realistic language commands with instance-specific descriptions compared to the baseline. We validate the practicality and effectiveness of our approach through extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autonomous Agents; Semantics; Community Detection Algorithms; Labeled Data; Language Model; Map Representations; Mental Maps; On Demands; Ontology's; Semantic Associations; Semantic Map; Spatial Maps; Navigation","Autonomous agents; Semantics; Community detection algorithms; Labeled data; Language model; Map representations; Mental maps; On demands; Ontology's; Semantic associations; Semantic map; Spatial maps; Navigation","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85187015327"

We assess the framework empirically in the autonomous driving domain and present our key observations. In our implementation, we construct the domain knowledge ontology by 'chatting' with ChatGPT. The key finding is that while fully automated domain ontology construction is possible, human supervision and early intervention typically improve efficiency and output quality as they lessen the effects of response randomness and the butterfly effect. We, therefore, also develop a web-based distillation assistant enabling supervision and flexible intervention at runtime.

Though, the scattered nature of cellulose knowledge with ambiguous terms and datasets presents significant obstacles to its optimal utilization. This project seeks to address these challenges by systematically accumulating scattered knowledge about cellulose, enabling it to be modifiable, extensible, and reusable. The objective of the project is to develop an automated system to extract relevant cellulosic terms from scientific publications which will show an improved performance in named entity classification by taking additional context and disambiguous information from an existing cellulose ontology. An incremental training process will be utilized to train a ScispaCy language model, which is specifically designed for analyzing scientific, clinical, and biomedical texts, in order to accomplish this task. The system will also generate new terms for the ontology by taking the existing ontology into account. Therefore, the proposed system will facilitate the extension of the ontology, while simultaneously benefiting from the ontology to enhance performance in named entity classification.

The subsequent natural language (NL) question generation is conducted through crowdsourcing or other automated methods, such as rule-based paraphrasing or NL question templates. Although some of these datasets are of considerable size, their pitfall lies in their pattern-based generation approaches, which do not always generalize well to the vague and linguistically diverse questions asked by humans in real-world contexts.

Predicting the functions of isoforms is an essential topic in bioinformatics as it can provide valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms of gene regulation and biological processes. Conventionally, gene function labels are standardized in Gene Ontology (GO) terms. However, traditional methods for predicting isoform function are largely limited by the absence of isoform-specific labels, sparse annotations, and the vast number of GO terms. To address these issues, we propose HANIso, a deep learning-based method for isoform function prediction. HANIso leverages a pretrained protein language model to extract features from protein sequences. It also integrates heterogeneous information, such as isoform sequence features, GO annotations, and isoform interaction data, using a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN). This allows the model to learn the importance of different sources of information and their semantic relationships through the attention mechanism. Our method can predict function labels at both the gene level and isoform level. We conduct experiments on two species datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on both AUROC and AUPRC. HANIso has the potential to overcome the limitations of traditional methods and provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of isoform function. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alternative Splicing; Gene Ontology; Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network; Isoform Function Prediction; Protein Language Model; Bioinformatics; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Forecasting; Genes; Proteins; Semantics; Alternative Splicing; Function Prediction; Gene Ontology; Gene Ontology Terms; Heterogeneous Graph; Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network; Isoform Function Prediction; Isoforms; Language Model; Protein Language Model; Gene Ontology","Bioinformatics; Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Forecasting; Genes; Proteins; Semantics; Alternative splicing; Function prediction; Gene ontology; Gene ontology terms; Heterogeneous graph; Heterogeneous graph attention network; Isoform function prediction; Isoforms; Language model; Protein language model; Gene Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184931633"

Ontologies exist in a spectrum of formality, from lexical thesauri to knowledge graphs, to collections of statements of first-order logic. The recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to bear interactive 'knowledge bases' with general awareness of most things. As ontologists create ontologies from their understanding of reality; and as LLMs, presumably, possess some 'understanding' of reality, embedded in their vector matrices corresponding to lexical terms from massive quantities of learned texts, a question is posed: what form of ontology can an LLM create when prompted about some novel facet of reality, without explicitly asking it for an ontology? I.e., will an LLM categorize things into bins, or a subsumption hierarchy, or perhaps something else? LLMs, as they are understood, respond when prompted with the most likely response, because they are predictors of next tokens, i.e., they are stochastic parrots. In any case, it is posited that, if prompted without any explicit request for an ontology, an LLM can produce an ontology of novel form, effectively granting insight into the 'understanding' an LLM has of the world, as all humans possess an understanding of the world that ontologies are based upon.

Due to the rapid growth of unstructured data on the web, studying how to automatically get ontology from unstructured text is important. Therefore, ontology learning (OL) is an important process in the business world. It involves finding and extracting concepts from the text so that these concepts can be used for things such as information retrieval. Unfortunately, learning ontology is not easy for some reasons, and there has not been much research on how to automatically learn a domain-specific ontology from data.Ontology Studying Arabic text is not as developed as learning Latin text. There is almost no automated support for using Arabic literary knowledge in semantically enabled systems. Machine learning (ML) has proven beneficial in numerous fields, including text mining. By employing neural language models such as AraBERT, it is possible to obtain word embeddings as distributed word representations from textual input using machine learning. However, the application of machine learning to aid the development of Arabic ontology is largely unexplored. This research examines the performance of AraBERT for ontology learning tasks in Arabic. Early performance results as an application of Arabic ontology learning are promising.

In computer science, ontologies are software artifacts containing the schematic structure for machine-readable knowledge, typically formed as a graph of subject-predicate-object triples, constrained through Description Logics. These resources and their relations are self-defining, i.e., some resource may be defined by considering all its stated relations. Resources are often attended with natural language annotations, that humans may read and interpret, such as labels and definitions. Many long-standing ontologies have useless lexical definitions that define resources cyclically, e.g., a FOAF: Person is simply defined as 'A person'. In Aristotelian terms, the definition of a thing should be reducible, by using terms simpler than itself, such that every definition can be unpacked up to the most general thing, which can only be defined by stating examples and use cases.

Expanding requirements is one of the techniques involved in finding information. In the search engine environment, the query extension includes the evaluation of the value of the construction and the extension of search queries to match new documents. In natural language processing (NLP), word embedding is a term used in textbook parsing, usually as a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of adjacent words in the vector. It is assumed that the space will be analogous in meaning. Word embedding can be achieved using a set of language models and point literacy methods where vocabulary words or expressions are mapped to vectors of real numbers. For query expansion, one method used is natural language processing through word embedding. Other approaches are ontology, machine learning, and deep learning for automatic query expansion.

However, publicly available data have been scarce for these tasks due to strict privacy constraints and high annotation costs. To make things worse, the non-overlapping entity spaces from different datasets hinder the knowledge transfer between document types. In this paper, we propose a method to collect massive-scale and weakly labeled data from the web to benefit the training of VDER models. The collected dataset, named DocumentNet, does not depend on specific document types or entity sets, making it universally applicable to all VDER tasks.

However, approaches that use ontologies face a challenge because common-sense knowledge is often implicit, i.e., it is obvious to humans but not explicitly stated. This paper investigates if Large Language Models (LLMs) can fill this gap. Our experiments reveal limited effectiveness in the selective extraction of contextual action knowledge, suggesting that LLMs may not be sufficient on their own. However, the large-scale extraction of general, actionable knowledge shows potential, indicating that LLMs can be a suitable tool for efficiently creating ontologies for robots. This paper shows that the technique used for knowledge extraction can be applied to populate a minimalist ontology, showcasing the potential of LLMs in synergy with formal knowledge representation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Common-sense Knowledge; Knowledge Extraction; Large Language Models; Robotics; Computational Linguistics; Extraction; Knowledge Representation; Robots; Commonsense Knowledge; Formal Knowledge Representations; Knowledge Extraction; Language Model; Large Language Model; Large-scales; Ontology's; Selective Extraction; Service Robots; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Extraction; Knowledge representation; Robots; Commonsense knowledge; Formal knowledge representations; Knowledge extraction; Language model; Large language model; Large-scales; Ontology's; Selective extraction; Service robots; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184382211"

However, the lack of adequate metadata often transforms these data lakes into data swamps, making it challenging to locate relevant data for critical organizational tasks and consequently limiting their utility. Recent advancements in large language models and foundation models have enabled the automation of metadata generation using generative AI models and the use of generated metadata for mapping tabular data into semantically richer glossaries, taxonomies, or ontologies. In this talk, we will present a semantic enrichment process that generates table metadata such as descriptive table captions, tags, expanded column names, and column descriptions and then uses that information to map table columns to concepts in a given business glossary or an ontology. Furthermore, during this process, we represent both table metadata and business glossaries as knowledge graphs and connect them by mapping columns to business concepts. As a result, the enrichment process makes the data in data lakes more meaningful to the organization and enhances downstream tasks, including improved table search and discovery, efficient table joins, and advanced business analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Lakes; Foundation Models; Knowledge Graph; Large Language Models; Semantic Enrichment; Computational Linguistics; Glossaries; Knowledge Graph; Lakes; Mapping; Ontology; Semantics; Business Glossary; Data Lake; Foundation Models; Heterogeneous Data; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Organisational; Semantic Enrichment; Metadata","Computational linguistics; Glossaries; Knowledge graph; Lakes; Mapping; Ontology; Semantics; Business glossary; Data lake; Foundation models; Heterogeneous data; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Organisational; Semantic enrichment; Metadata","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184379489"

We seek to develop a large language model (LLM) that can perform Open-world Entity Profiling with instruction tuning to extract desirable entity profiles characterized by (possibly fine-grained) natural language instructions. In particular, we construct INSTRUCTOPENWIKI, a substantial instruction-tuning dataset for Open-world Entity Profiling enriched with a comprehensive corpus, extensive annotations, and diverse instructions.

Most existing methods are based on entity-independent features such as graph structure information and relationship information to inference.

In this work, we propose a knowledge graph inductive inference method that fuses ontology information. Based on the enclosing subgraph, we bring in feature embeddings of concepts corresponding to entities to learn the semantic information implicit in the ontology. Considering that the ontology information of entities may be missing, we build a type constraint regular loss to explicitly model the semantic connections between entities and concepts, and thus capture the missing concepts of entities.

We flip the problem on its head by leveraging the LLM as a tool for data augmentation rather than a model for direct prediction.

Since different types of issues are embedded in the model parameters, the development of automated methods that capture all relevant aspects remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a visual analytics approach that supports the exploratory analysis of text sequences generated by causal language models.

To this end, we leverage a unified, ontology-driven embedding space, serving as a shared foundation for the thematic concepts present in the generated text sequences.

Additionally, we developed a standardization pipeline that automatically maps clinical note titles from multiple sites to suitable LOINC DO codes, without accessing the content of clinical notes.

However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them explored the use of the different ontology components for disease/phenotype NER under the distant supervision scheme. In this study, we explored whether different ontology components can be used to develop a distantly supervised disease/phenotype entity recognition model. We trained different models by considering ontology labels, synonyms, definitions, axioms and their combinations in addition to a model trained on literature. Results showed that content from the disease/phenotype ontologies can be exploited to develop a NER model performing at the state-of-the-art level. In particular, models that utilised both the ontology definitions and axioms showed competitive performance compared to the model trained on literature. This relieves the need of finding and annotating external corpora. Furthermore, models trained using ontology components made zero-shot predictions on the test datasets which were not observed by the models training on the literature based datasets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Named Entity Recognition; Ontologies; Text Mining; Character Recognition; Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing Systems; Text Processing; Zero-shot Learning; Disease Phenotypes; Entity Recognition; Labeled Data; Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Ontology's; Recognition Models; State Of The Art; Text-mining; Wikipedia; Ontology","Character recognition; Deep learning; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Zero-shot learning; Disease phenotypes; Entity recognition; Labeled data; Language model; Named entity recognition; Ontology's; Recognition models; State of the art; Text-mining; Wikipedia; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85182257589"

However, the construction of WordNets can be challenging, especially for low-resource languages such as Filipino. The existing Filipino WordNet has not been maintained, and lacks contextual information for identifying the evolution of word senses. In this study, we built a corpus of 5,370,667 unique tokens and used it to construct a Filipino WordNet via a two-way approach that combines natural language processing and network science. For the natural language processing approach, we utilized only two linguistic sources: our corpus and a RoBERTa-based language model that generates sentence embeddings. For the network science approach, we created a temporal-multiplex network that represents the co-occurrence of words, their semantic relationships, and their usage in different sources across time.

However, the existing approach of CaLiGraph is producing incomplete and non-fine grained mappings. In this paper, we tackle the problem as ontology alignment, where structural information of knowledge graphs and lexical and semantic features of ontology class names are utilized to discover confident mappings, which are in turn utilized for finetuing pretrained language models in a distant supervision fashion.

Our model SLHCat is evaluated over a benchmark dataset constructed by annotating 3000 fine-grained CaLiGraph-DBpedia mapping pairs.

Protocol and data format translation has been attempted previously through rule-based approaches, ontologies, and also by using machine learning (ML) techniques. Due to the current advances related to AI/ML methods, tools, and infrastructure, the accuracy and feasibility of 'translation' with ML-approaches improved significantly. This paper introduces a generic approach and methodology for translating data formats and protocols with ML-based methods and presents our initial results through JSON-XML and JSON-SenML translation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Llm; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Neural Machine Translation; Protocol Translation; Computational Linguistics; Learning Algorithms; Natural Language Processing Systems; Translation (languages); Description Schemes; Language Processing; Llm; Machine-learning; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Protocol Translations; Rule-based Approach; System Use; Translation Method; Machine Learning","Computational linguistics; Learning algorithms; Natural language processing systems; Translation (languages); Description schemes; Language processing; LLM; Machine-learning; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Protocol translations; Rule-based approach; System use; Translation method; Machine learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180009347"

However, when faced with more complex and interconnected tasks that demand a profound and iterative thought process, LLMs reveal their inherent limitations. Autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems represent a strategic response to these challenges. While these architectures hold promising potential in amplifying AI capabilities, striking the right balance between different levels of autonomy and alignment remains the crucial challenge for their effective operation. This paper proposes a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy, engineered to analyze how autonomous LLM-powered multi-agent systems balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various aspects inherent to architectural viewpoints such as goal-driven task management, agent composition, multi-agent collaboration, and context interaction. Our taxonomy aims to empower researchers, engineers, and AI practitioners to systematically analyze the architectural dynamics and balancing strategies employed by these increasingly prevalent AI systems. The exploratory taxonomic classification of selected representative LLM-powered multi-agent systems illustrates its practical utility and reveals potential for future research and development.

Minimizing the enhancement cycles of prompt with improvised keywords becomes critically important as it directly affects the time to market and cost of the developing solution. However, this process inevitably has a trade-off between the learning curve/proficiency of the user and completeness of the prompt, as generating such a solutions is an incremental process. In this paper, we have designed a novel solution and implemented it in the form of a plugin for Visual Studio Code IDE, which can optimize this trade-off, by learning the underlying prompt intent to enhance with keywords.

Therefore, many clinical information management tasks require to unlock this information using natural language processing (NLP). Clinical corpora annotated by humans are crucial resources. On the one hand, they are needed to train and domain-fine-tune language models with the goal to transform information from unstructured free text into an interoperable form. On the other hand, manually annotated corpora are indispensable for assessing the results of information extraction using NLP. Annotation quality is crucial. Therefore, detailed annotation guidelines are needed to define the form that extracted information should take, to prevent human annotators from making erratic annotation decisions and to guarantee a good inter-annotator agreement. Our hypothesis is that, to this end, human annotations (and subsequently machine annotations learned from human annotations) should (i) be based on ontological principles, and (ii) be consistent with existing clinical documentation standards. With the experience of several annotation projects, we highlight the need for sophisticated guidelines. We formulate a set of abstract principles on which such guidelines should be based, followed by examples of how to keep them, on the one hand, user-friendly and consistent, and on the other hand compatible with the international semantic standards SNOMED CT and FHIR, including their areas of overlap. We sketch the representation of the resulting representations in a knowledge graph as a state-of-the-art semantic representation paradigm, which can be enriched by additional content on A-Box and T-Box levels and on which symbolic and neural reasoning tasks can be applied. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clinical Information Models; Electronic Health Records; Formal Ontologies; Natural Language Processing; Text Annotation Guidelines; Abstracting; Information Management; Information Theory; Information Use; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Clinical Information; Clinical Information Model; Electronic Health; Electronic Health Record; Formal Ontology; Health Records; Information Modeling; Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Text Annotation Guideline; Text Annotations; Semantics","Abstracting; Information management; Information theory; Information use; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Clinical information; Clinical information model; Electronic health; Electronic health record; Formal ontology; Health records; Information Modeling; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Text annotation guideline; Text annotations; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178585442"

In the service computing community, researchers tried to harness the enormous potential of KG to tackle domain-specific tasks. However, the lack of an openly available service domain KG limits the in-depth exploration of KGs in domain-specific applications. Building a service domain KG primarily faces two challenges: first, the diversity and complexity of service domain knowledge, and second, the dispersion of domain knowledge and the lack of annotated data. These challenges discouraged costly investment in large, high-quality domain-specific KGs by researchers. In this paper, we present the construction of a service domain KG called BEAR. We design a comprehensive service domain knowledge ontology to automatically generate the prompts for the Large Language Model (LLM) and employ LLM to implement a zero-shot method to extract high-quality knowledge. A series of experiments are conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of graph construction process and showcase the richness of content available from BEAR. Currently, BEAR includes 133, 906 nodes, 169, 159 relations, and about 424, 000 factual knowledge as attributes, which is available through github.com/HTXone/BEAR. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph Construction; Large Language Model; Service Domain Knowledge Graph; Service Domain Ontology; Computational Linguistics; Digital Storage; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Zero-shot Learning; Domain Knowledge; Domain Ontologies; Graph Construction; Knowledge Graph Construction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Service Domain; Service Domain Knowledge Graph; Service Domain Ontology; Knowledge Graph","Computational linguistics; Digital storage; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Zero-shot learning; Domain knowledge; Domain ontologies; Graph construction; Knowledge graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Service domain; Service domain knowledge graph; Service domain ontology; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178217581"

Furthermore, the complexity and specialized language of legal documents pose challenges not just for those in the legal domain but also for the general public. This emphasizes the potential role and impact of Legal Natural Language Processing (Legal NLP). Although advancements have been made in this domain, particularly after 2015 with the advent of Deep Learning and Large Language Models (LLMs), a systematic exploration of this progress until 2022 is nonexistent. In this research, we perform a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to bridge this gap.We aim to provide a descriptive statistical analysis of the Legal NLP research between 2015 and 2022. Categorize and sub-categorize primary publications based on their research problems. Identify limitations and areas of improvement in current research. Using a robust search methodology across four reputable indexers, we filtered 536 papers down to 75 pivotal articles. Our findings reveal the diverse methods employed for tasks such as Multiclass Classification, Summarization, and Question Answering in the Legal NLP field.We also highlight resources, challenges, and gaps in current methodologies and emphasize the need for curated datasets, ontologies, and a focus on inherent difficulties like data accessibility. As the legal sector gradually embraces Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding the capabilities and limitations of Legal NLP becomes vital for ensuring efficient and ethical application. The research offers insights for both Legal NLP researchers and the broader legal community, advocating for continued advancements in automation while also addressing ethical concerns. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Deep Learning; Information Retrieval; Law; Legal-nlp; Natural Language Processing; Search Problems; Surveys; Systematic-mapping-study; Systematics; Task Analysis; Ethical Technology; Job Analysis; Mapping; Natural Language Processing Systems; Deep Learning; Language Processing; Law; Legal-natural Language Processing; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Search Problem; Systematic; Systematic Mapping Studies; Task Analysis","Ethical technology; Job analysis; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Deep learning; Language processing; Law; Legal-natural language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Search problem; Systematic; Systematic mapping studies; Task analysis","Article","aip","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178053115"

By fine-tuning the pre-trained BERT on the CORD-NER dataset, the model gains the ability to comprehend the context and semantics of biomedical named entities. The refined model is then utilized on the CORD-19 to extract more contextually relevant and updated named entities. However, fine-tuning large datasets with LLMs poses a challenge. To counter this, two distinct sampling methodologies are proposed to apply on each dataset. First, for the NER task on the CORD-19, a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling technique is employed. This maintains the sentence structure while concentrating on related content. Second, a straightforward greedy method is deployed to gather the most informative data of 25 entity types from the CORD-NER dataset. The study realizes its goals by demonstrating the content comprehension capability of BERT-based models without the necessity of supercomputers, and converting the document-level corpus into a source for NER data, enhancing data accessibility. The outcomes of this research can shed light on the potential progression of more sophisticated NLP applications across various sectors, including knowledge graph creation, ontology learning, and conversational AI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Cord-19; Cord-ner; Dataset Sampling; Document Level Entity Extraction; Large Language Models; Ner; Computational Linguistics; Large Dataset; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Statistics; Bert; Cord-19; Cord-named Entity Recognition; Dataset Sampling; Document Level Entity Extraction; Entity Extractions; Language Model; Large Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Supercomputers","Computational linguistics; Large dataset; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Statistics; BERT; CORD-19; CORD-named entity recognition; Dataset sampling; Document level entity extraction; Entity extractions; Language model; Large language model; Named entity recognition; Supercomputers","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177820256"

LLMs and Knowledge Graphs (KG) can complement each other such that LLMs can be used for KG construction or completion while existing KGs can be used for different tasks such as making LLM outputs explainable or fact-checking in Neuro-Symbolic manner. In this paper, we present Text2KGBench, a benchmark to evaluate the capabilities of language models to generate KGs from natural language text guided by an ontology. Given an input ontology and a set of sentences, the task is to extract facts from the text while complying with the given ontology (concepts, relations, domain/range constraints) and being faithful to the input sentences. We provide two datasets (i) Wikidata-TekGen with 10 ontologies and 13,474 sentences and (ii) DBpedia-WebNLG with 19 ontologies and 4,860 sentences. We define seven evaluation metrics to measure fact extraction performance, ontology conformance, and hallucinations by LLMs. Furthermore, we provide results for two baseline models, Vicuna-13B and Alpaca-LoRA-13B using automatic prompt generation from test cases. The baseline results show that there is room for improvement using both Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing techniques.

LLMs have shown significant advancements in natural language processing, demonstrating their ability to capture complex language patterns in different knowledge domains. Our LLMs4OL paradigm investigates the following hypothesis: Can LLMs effectively apply their language pattern capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from natural language text? To test this hypothesis, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations. Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical knowledge in GeoNames, and medical knowledge in UMLS. The obtained empirical results show that foundational LLMs are not sufficiently suitable for ontology construction that entails a high degree of reasoning skills and domain expertise. Nevertheless, when effectively fine-tuned they just might work as suitable assistants, alleviating the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, for ontology construction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Llms; Ontologies; Ontology Learning; Prompt-based Learning; Prompting; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Zero-shot Learning; Language Model; Language Patterns; Large Language Model; Ontology Construction; Ontology Learning; Ontology's; Prompt-based Learning; Prompting; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Zero-shot learning; Language model; Language patterns; Large language model; Ontology construction; Ontology learning; Ontology's; Prompt-based learning; Prompting; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177183557"

Based on this finding, the PreDiBioOntoL (Predicting Clinical Diagnosis by combining BioMedical Ontologies and Language Models) project aims at developing a computer-aided clinical and predictive diagnosis tool to help clinicians to better handle their patients. This tool will combine deep neural networks trained on heterogeneous data sources and biomedical ontologies. The first obtained results of PreDiBioOntoL are presented in this paper. We propose new siamese neural models (BioSTransformers and BioS-MiniLM) that embed texts to be compared in a vector space and then find their similarities. The models optimize an objective self-supervised contrastive learning function on articles from the scientific literature (MEDLINE bibliographic database) associated with their MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) keywords. The obtained results on several benchmarks show that the proposed models can solve different biomedical tasks without examples (zero-shot). These results are comparable to those of other biomedical transformers that are fine-tuned on supervised data specific to the problems being addressed. Moreover, we show in this paper how these new siamese models are exploited in order to semantically map entities from several biomedical ontologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Biomedical Ontologies; Biomedical Texts; Contrastive Learning; Language Models; Ontology Alignment; Siamese Neural Networks; Transformers; Zero-shot Learning; Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Computer Aided Diagnosis; Decision Support Systems; Deep Neural Networks; Information Services; Learning Systems; Medical Computing; Ontology; Text Processing; Biomedical Ontologies; Biomedical Text; Contrastive Learning; Heterogeneous Data; Language Model; Neural-networks; Ontology Alignment; Siamese Neural Network; Text Classification; Transformer; Vector Spaces","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Computer aided diagnosis; Decision support systems; Deep neural networks; Information services; Learning systems; Medical computing; Ontology; Text processing; Biomedical ontologies; Biomedical text; Contrastive learning; Heterogeneous data; Language model; Neural-networks; Ontology alignment; Siamese neural network; Text classification; Transformer; Vector spaces","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85177181193"

Task specificity should go hand in hand with domain orientation, that is, the specialization of an LLM to accurately address the tasks of a given realm of interest. However, models are usually fine-tuned over publicly available data or, at most, over ground data from databases, ignoring business-level definitions and domain experience. On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) are able to capture and augment such domain knowledge via ontological reasoning. With the goal of combining LLM flexibility with the domain orientation of EKGs, we propose a novel neurosymbolic architecture that leverages the power of ontological reasoning to build task- and domain-specific corpora for LLM fine-tuning. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graphs; Language Models; Ontological Reasoning; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Domain Knowledge; Domain Orientation; Fine Tuning; Ground Data; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Enterprise; Ontological Reasoning; Specialisation; Training Data; Knowledge Graph","Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Ontology; Domain knowledge; Domain orientation; Fine tuning; Ground data; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large enterprise; Ontological reasoning; Specialisation; Training data; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175989701"

This work investigates whether MMPLMs can be applied to clinical domain machine translation (MT) towards entirely unseen languages via transfer learning. We carry out an experimental investigation using Meta-AI's MMPLMs ""wmt21-dense24-wide-en-X and X-en (WMT21fb)""which were pre-trained on 7 language pairs and 14 translation directions including English to Czech, German, Hausa, Icelandic, Japanese, Russian, and Chinese, and the opposite direction. We fine-tune these MMPLMs towards English-Spanish language pair which did not exist at all in their original pre-trained corpora both implicitly and explicitly. We prepare carefully aligned clinical domain data for this fine-tuning, which is different from their original mixed domain knowledge. Our experimental result shows that the fine-tuning is very successful using just 250k well-aligned in-domain ENES segments for three sub-task translation testings: clinical cases, clinical terms, and ontology concepts. It achieves very close evaluation scores to another MMPLM NLLB from Meta-AI, which included Spanish as a high-resource setting in the pre-training. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work on using MMPLMs towards clinical domain transferlearning NMT successfully for totally unseen languages during pre-training. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Computer Aided Language Translation; Domain Knowledge; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Transfer Learning; Well Testing; Domain Machines; Down-stream; Experimental Investigations; Fine Tuning; Language Model; Language Pairs; Machine Translation Models; Machine Translations; Pre-training; Machine Translation","Computational linguistics; Computer aided language translation; Domain Knowledge; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Transfer learning; Well testing; Domain machines; Down-stream; Experimental investigations; Fine tuning; Language model; Language pairs; Machine translation models; Machine translations; Pre-training; Machine translation","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175455609"

Our study focuses on biomedical entities defined in the UMLS ontology and aims to help prioritize the translation efforts of these entities. In particular, we develop an effective tool for scoring the idiomaticity of biomedical MWEs based on the degree of similarity between the semantic representations of those MWEs and a weighted average of the representation of their constituents. We achieve this using a biomedical language model trained to produce similar representations for entity names and their definitions, called BioLORD. The importance of this definition-based approach is highlighted by comparing the BioLORD model to two other state-of-the-art biomedical language models based on Transformer: SapBERT and CODER. Our results show that the BioLORD model has a strong ability to identify idiomatic MWEs, not replicated in other models. Our corpus-free idiomaticity estimation helps ontology translators to focus on more challenging MWEs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Terminology; Translation (languages); Clinical Terminology; Degree Of Similarity; Effective Tool; Idiomatics; Language Model; Multi-word Expressions; Ontology's; Semantic Modelling; Semantic Representation; Weighted Averages; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Semantics; Terminology; Translation (languages); Clinical terminology; Degree of similarity; Effective tool; Idiomatics; Language model; Multi-word expressions; Ontology's; Semantic modelling; Semantic representation; Weighted averages; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85175233350"

Several research questions have been focused on, from the investigation of a possible heuristics to provide at least hints to annotators which verbs to include and which are outside the current version of the ontology, to the possible use of the automatic scores to help the annotators to be more efficient in finding a threshold for identifying verbs that cannot be assigned to any existing class and therefore they are to be used as seeds for a new class. We have also carefully examined the correlation of the automatic scores with the human annotation. While the correlation turned out to be strong, its influence on the annotation proper is modest due to its near linearity, even though the mere fact of such pre-annotation leads to relatively short annotation times. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Learning Systems; 'current; Event Types; Human Annotations; Language Model; Machine Learning Methods; Ontology's; Research Questions; Ontology","Learning systems; 'current; Event Types; Human annotations; Language model; Machine learning methods; Ontology's; Research questions; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174806193"

The large amount of unstructured full-text event descriptions makes a case-by-case analysis unmanageable, particularly for low-resource humanitarian aid organizations. This creates a demand to classify events into event types, a task referred to as event coding. Typically, domain experts craft an event type ontology, annotators label a large dataset and technical experts develop a supervised coding system. In this work, we propose PR-ENT1, a new event coding approach that is more flexible and resource-efficient, while maintaining competitive accuracy: first, we extend an event description such as “Military injured two civilians” by a template, e.g. “People were [Z]” and prompt a pre-trained (cloze) language model to fill the slot Z. Second, we select suitable answer candidates Z∗ = {“injured”, “hurt”...} by treating the event description as premise and the filled templates as hypothesis in a textual entailment task. In a final step, the selected answer candidate can be mapped to its corresponding event type. This allows domain experts to draft the codebook directly as labeled prompts and interpretable answer candidates. This human-in-the-loop process is guided by our codebook design tool2. We show that our approach is robust through several checks: perturbing the event description and prompt template, restricting the vocabulary and removing contextual information. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Case Analysis; Domain Experts; Event Description; Event Types; Humanitarian Aids; Large Amounts; Large Datasets; Ontology's; Political Events; Technical Experts; Large Dataset","Computational linguistics; Case analysis; Domain experts; Event description; Event Types; Humanitarian aids; Large amounts; Large datasets; Ontology's; Political events; Technical experts; Large dataset","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85174564374"

However, due to the semantic gap between general-domain text used for pre-training and domain-specific text, these methods encounter semantic redundancy and domain semantics insufficiency when it comes to domain-specific tasks. To mitigate this issue, we propose a low-cost and effective knowledge-enhanced method to facilitate domain-specific semantics modeling in joint entity and relation extraction. Precisely, we use ontology and entity type descriptions as domain knowledge sources, which are encoded and incorporated into the downstream entity and relation extraction model to improve its understanding of domain-specific information. We construct a dataset called SSUIE-RE for Chinese entity and relation extraction in space science and utilization domain of China Manned Space Engineering, which contains a wealth of domain-specific knowledge.

We emulate an entity-based approach by comparing different types of input: raw text, extracted entities and a triple-based reformulation of the document content.

Recent research has focused on explaining the knowledge BERT acquires from the textual sources used for pre-training its linguistic model. In this study, we analyze the latent vector space produced by BERT's context-aware word embeddings. Our aim is to determine whether certain areas of the BERT vector space have an explicit meaning related to a Knowledge Graph (KG). Using the Link Prediction (LP) task, we demonstrate the presence of explicit and meaningful regions of the BERT vector space.

Furthermore, for such systems, catering to multiple application domains typically requires the acquisition of even more training data. We discuss an alternative approach to the problem of open-domain conversational question answering by utilizing knowledge graphs to capture relevant information from a body of text in any domain. We achieve this by allowing the relations of the knowledge graphs to be drawn directly from the body of text being processed, rather than from a fixed ontology.

The aim of open information extraction in the field of defense technology is to extract structured triplets containing subject, predicate, object, and other arguments from the massive amount of information available on the internet. This technology has important implications for ontology induction and the construction of knowledge graphs in the defense technology domain. However, while information extraction experiments in the general domain yield good results, open information extraction in the defense technology domain faces several challenges, such as a lack of domain annotated data, arguments overlapping unadaptability, and unrecognizable long entities.[Methods] In this paper, an annotation strategy is proposed based on the entity boundaries, and an annotated dataset in the defense technology field combined with the experience of domain experts was constructed. Furthermore, a two-stage open information extraction method is proposed in the defense technology field that utilizes a pretrained language model-based sequence labeling algorithm to extract predicates and a multihead attention mechanism to learn the prediction of argument boundaries. In the first stage, the input sentence was converted into an input sequence < [CLS], input sentence [SEP] >, and the input sequence was encoded using a pretrained language model to obtain an implicit state representation of the input sequence. Based on this sentence representation, a conditional random field (CRF) layer was used to predict the position of the predicates, i. e., to predict the BIO labels of the words. In the second stage, the predicated predicates from the first stage were concatenated with the original sentence and converted into an input sequence < [CLS], predicate [SEP], and input sentence [SEP] >, which was encoded using a pretrained language model to obtain an implicit state representation of the input sequence. This representation was then fed to a multihead pointer network to predict the position of the argument. The predicted position was tagged with the actual position to calculate the cross-entropy loss function. Finally, the predicates and the arguments predicted by the predicate and argument extraction models were combined to obtain the complete triplet.[Results] The experimental results from the extensive experiments conducted on a self-built annotated dataset in the defense technology field reveal the following. (1) In predicate extraction, our method achieved a 3. 92% performance improvement in the Fl value as compared to LSTM methods and more than 10% performance improvement as compared to syntactic analysis methods. (2) In argument extraction, our method achieved a considerable performance improvement of more than 16% in the Fl value as compared to LSTM methods and about 11% in the Fl value as compared to the BERT + CRF method.[Conclusions] The proposed two-stage open information extraction method can overcome the challenge of arguments overlapping unadaptability and the difficulty of long-span entity extraction, thus improving the shortcomings of existing open information extraction methods. Extensive experimental analysis conducted on the self-built annotated dataset proved the effectiveness of the proposed method. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Defense Technology; Knowledge Graph; Open Information Extraction; Pretrained Language Model; Subject-verb-object Complement; Computational Linguistics; Forecasting; Information Retrieval; Knowledge Graph; Network Security; Annotated Datasets; Defence Technology; Information Extraction Methods; Input Sequence; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Open Information Extraction; Pretrained Language Model; Subject-verb-object Complement; Technology Fields; Random Processes","Computational linguistics; Forecasting; Information retrieval; Knowledge graph; Network security; Annotated datasets; Defence technology; Information extraction methods; Input sequence; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Open information extraction; Pretrained language model; Subject-verb-object complement; Technology fields; Random processes","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171629927"

As impressive as the majority of interactions with ChatGPT are, this large language model has a number of acknowledged shortcomings, which in several cases, may be directly related to how ChatGPT handles uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to pave the way to formal analysis of ChatGPT uncertainty handling. To this end, the ability of the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Framework (URREF) ontology is assessed, to support such analysis. Elements of structured experiments for reproducible results are identified. The dataset built varies Information Criteria of Correctness, Non-specificity, Self-confidence, Relevance and Inconsistency, and the Source Criteria of Reliability, Competency and Type. ChatGPT's answers are analyzed along Information Criteria of Correctness, Non-specificity and Self-confidence. Both generic and singular information are sequentially provided. The outcome of this preliminary study is twofold: Firstly, we validate that the experimental setup is efficient in capturing aspects of ChatGPT uncertainty handling. Secondly, we identify possible modifications to the URREF ontology that will be discussed and eventually implemented in URREF ontology Version 4.0 under development. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information Quality; Large Language Models; Nlp; Ontology; Source Quality; Uncertainty Evaluation; Computational Linguistics; Quality Control; Uncertainty Analysis; Information Quality; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Reasoning Framework; Source Quality; Uncertainty Evaluation; Uncertainty Handling; Uncertainty Reasoning; Uncertainty Representation; Ontology","Computational linguistics; Quality control; Uncertainty analysis; Information quality; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Reasoning framework; Source quality; Uncertainty evaluation; Uncertainty handling; Uncertainty reasoning; Uncertainty representation; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171522315"

This data analysis can highly benefit from language processing systems, e.g., by classifying the text data according to a humanitarian ontology. However, approaching this by simply fine-tuning a generic large language model (LLM) involves considerable practical and ethical issues, particularly the lack of effectiveness on data-sparse and complex subdomains, and the encoding of societal biases and unwanted associations. In this work, we aim to provide an effective and ethically-aware system for humanitarian data analysis. We approach this by (1) introducing a novel architecture adjusted to the humanitarian analysis framework, (2) creating and releasing a novel humanitarian-specific LLM called HumBERT, and (3) proposing a systematic way to measure and mitigate biases. Our results show the better performance of our approach on zero-shot and full-training settings in comparison with strong baseline models, while also revealing the existence of biases in the resulting LLMs. Utilizing a targeted counterfactual data augmentation approach, we significantly reduce these biases without compromising performance. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Handling; Information Analysis; Knowledge Management; Zero-shot Learning; Domain Knowledge; Fine Tuning; Humanitarian Aids; Language Model; Language Processing Systems; Ontology's; Performance; Practical Issues; Situation Analysis; Text Data; Domain Knowledge","Data handling; Information analysis; Knowledge management; Zero-shot learning; Domain knowledge; Fine tuning; Humanitarian aids; Language model; Language processing systems; Ontology's; Performance; Practical issues; Situation analysis; Text data; Domain Knowledge","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85170385846"

It is significant to explore whether Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) know and understand such knowledge. However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge, lacking a systematic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic understanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of; (3) domain and range constraints of properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in reasoning. However, both the memorizing and reasoning performances are less than perfect, indicating incomplete knowledge and understanding. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Ontology; Semantics; Domain Constraint; Factual Knowledge; Implicit Knowledge; Language Model; Logical Reasoning; Property; Range Constraints; Semantics Understanding; Surface Forms; World Knowledge; Sports","Computational linguistics; Ontology; Semantics; Domain constraint; Factual knowledge; Implicit knowledge; Language model; Logical reasoning; Property; Range constraints; Semantics understanding; Surface forms; World knowledge; Sports","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168843299"

To investigate an LM's knowledge of ontologies, we propose ONTOLAMA, a set of inference-based probing tasks and datasets from ontology subsumption axioms involving both atomic and complex concepts. We conduct extensive experiments on ontologies of different domains and scales, and our results demonstrate that LMs encode relatively less background knowledge of Subsumption Inference (SI) than traditional Natural Language Inference (NLI) but can improve on SI significantly when a small number of samples are given.

However, at the moment, building a knowledge graph involves a lot of manual effort and thus hinders their application in some situations and the automation of this process might benefit especially for small organizations. Automatically generating structured knowledge graphs from a large volume of natural language is still a challenging task and the research on sub-tasks such as named entity extraction, relation extraction, entity and relation linking, and knowledge graph construction aims to improve the state of the art of automatic construction and completion of knowledge graphs from text. The recent advancement of foundation models with billions of parameters trained in a self-supervised manner with large volumes of training data that can be adapted to a variety of downstream tasks has helped to demonstrate high performance on a large range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. In this context, one emerging paradigm is in-context learning where a language model is used as it is with a prompt that provides instructions and some examples to perform a task without changing the parameters of the model using traditional approaches such as fine-tuning. This way, no computing resources are needed for re-training/fine-tuning the models and the engineering effort is minimal. Thus, it would be beneficial to utilize such capabilities for generating knowledge graphs from text. In this paper, grounded by several research questions, we explore the capabilities of foundation models such as ChatGPT to generate knowledge graphs from the knowledge it captured during pre-training as well as the new text provided to it in the prompt. The paper provides a qualitative analysis of a set of example outputs generated by a foundation model with the aim of knowledge graph construction and completion. The results demonstrate promising capabilities. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and next steps for this research work. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Foundation Models; In-context Learning; Knowledge Graph Completion; Knowledge Graph Construction; Large Language Models; Ontology; Relation Extraction; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Engineering Education; Extraction; Foundations; Graphic Methods; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Context Learning; Foundation Models; Graph Construction; In Contexts; In-context Learning; Knowledge Graph Completion; Knowledge Graph Construction; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Large Language Model; Ontology's; Relation Extraction; Knowledge Graph","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Engineering education; Extraction; Foundations; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Context learning; Foundation models; Graph construction; In contexts; In-context learning; Knowledge graph completion; Knowledge graph construction; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Large language model; Ontology's; Relation extraction; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168818600"

Although emerging data mining tools are available for pan-cancer–related gene data analysis, few tools are dedicated to HCC. Moreover, tools specifically designed for HCC have restrictions such as small data scale and limited functionality. Therefore, we developed IHGA, a new interactive web server for discovering genes of interest in HCC on a large-scale and comprehensive basis. Integrative HCC Gene Analysis (IHGA) contains over 100 independent HCC patient-derived datasets (with over 10,000 tissue samples) and more than 90 cell models. IHGA allows users to conduct a series of large-scale and comprehensive analyses and data visualizations based on gene mRNA levels, including expression comparison, correlation analysis, clinical characteristics analysis, survival analysis, immune system interaction analysis, and drug sensitivity analysis. This method notably enhanced the richness of clinical data in IHGA. Additionally, IHGA integrates artificial intelligence (AI)–assisted gene screening based on natural language models. IHGA is free, user-friendly, and can effectively reduce time spent during data collection, organization, and analysis. In conclusion, IHGA is competitive in terms of data scale, data diversity, and functionality. It effectively alleviates the obstacles caused by HCC heterogeneity to data mining work and helps advance research on the molecular mechanisms of HCC. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Gene Expression Profile; Hepatocellular Carcinoma; Prognosis; Web Tools; Sorafenib; Gene Expression; Natural Language Processing Systems; Sensitivity Analysis; Web Services; Data-mining Tools; Gene Analysis; Gene Expression Data; Gene Expression Profiles; Hepatocellular Carcinoma; Large-scales; Prognose; Therapeutic Targets; Web Servers; Web Tools; Data Mining; Messenger Rna; Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 15; Solute Carrier Protein; Sorafenib; Unclassified Drug; Article; Artificial Intelligence; Cellular Distribution; Clinical Feature; Comparative Study; Differential Expression Analysis; Differential Gene Expression; Dimensionality Reduction; Disease Free Survival; Drug Sensitivity; Gene Expression; Gene Expression Level; Gene Ontology; Gene Set Enrichment Analysis; Human; Immune System; Liver Cell Carcinoma; Overall Survival; Tumor Suppressor Gene; Urea Cycle","Gene expression; Natural language processing systems; Sensitivity analysis; Web services; Data-mining tools; Gene analysis; Gene Expression Data; Gene expression profiles; Hepatocellular carcinoma; Large-scales; Prognose; Therapeutic targets; Web servers; Web tools; Data mining; messenger RNA; solute carrier family 25 member 15; solute carrier protein; sorafenib; unclassified drug; Article; artificial intelligence; cellular distribution; clinical feature; comparative study; differential expression analysis; differential gene expression; dimensionality reduction; disease free survival; drug sensitivity; gene expression; gene expression level; gene ontology; gene set enrichment analysis; human; immune system; liver cell carcinoma; overall survival; tumor suppressor gene; urea cycle","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85168805863"

For a student or novice researcher in the cybersecurity domain, there is a need to design an adaptive learning strategy that can break complex tasks and concepts into simple representations. An AI-enabled automated cybersecurity education system can improve cognitive engagement and active learning. Knowledge graphs (KG) provide a visual representation in a graph that can reason and interpret from the underlying data, making them suitable for use in education and interactive learning. However, there are no publicly available datasets for the cybersecurity education domain to build such systems. The data is present as unstructured educational course material, Wiki pages, capture the flag (CTF) writeups, etc. Creating knowledge graphs from unstructured text is challenging without an ontology or annotated dataset. However, data annotation for cybersecurity needs domain experts. To address these gaps, we made three contributions in this paper. First, we propose an ontology for the cybersecurity education domain for students and novice learners. Second, we develop AISecKG, a triple dataset with cybersecurity-related entities and relations as defined by the ontology.

The advancements of deep learning models further accelerate this development. However, applying these models to domain-specific data is crucial as applied domains often require different entity type extractions than general ones. This paper introduces BiodivBERT, the first pre-trained language model for the biodiversity domain. We constructed two pre-training corpora (abstracts and abstracts + full text) based on a keyword search strategy from two leading publishers in the Life Sciences. In addition, we fine-tuned BiodivBERT on two downstream tasks, i.e., Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE), using various state-of-the-art benchmarks. The results show that BiodivBERT outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, we discuss a potential application of BiodivBERT for ontology auto-population.

However, LLMs struggle with more complex aspects like recipe semantics and process comprehension. Furthermore, LLMs have limited ability to account for user preferences since they are based on statistical patterns. As a result, these recipes may be invalid. Evolutionary algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection are optimization algorithms that use stochastic operators to generate new solutions. These algorithms can generate large number of solutions from the set of possible solution space. Moreover, these algorithms have the capability to incorporate user preferences in fitness function to generate novel recipes that are more aligned with the fitness objective. In this paper, we propose the EvoRecipes framework to generate novel recipes. The EvoRecipes framework utilizes both Genetic Algorithm and generative AI in addition to RecipeOn ontology, and RecipeKG knowledge graph. Genetic Algorithm explore the large solution space of encoded recipe solutions and are capable of incorporating user preferences, while LLMs are used to generate recipe text from encoded recipe solutions. EvoRecipes uses a population of context-aware recipe solutions from the RecipeKG knowledge graph. RecipeKG encodes recipes in RDF format using classes and properties as defined in the RecipeOn ontology. Moreover, to evaluate the alignment of EvoRecipe generated recipes with multiple intended objectives, we propose a fitness function that incorporates novelty, simplicity, visual appeal, and feasibility. Additionally, to evaluate the quality of the EvoRecipe generated recipes while considering the subjective nature of recipes, we conducted a survey using multi-dimensional metrics (i.e. contextual, procedural, and novelty). Results show that EvoRecipes generated recipes are novel, valid and incorporate user preferences. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Creativity; Food; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Recipe; Recipe Evolution; Food Products; Function Evaluation; Knowledge Graph; Ontology; Quality Control; Resource Description Framework (rdf); Semantics; Stochastic Systems; User Interfaces; Computational Creativities; Creativity; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Ontology's; Recipe; Recipe Evolution; Resources Description Frameworks; Genetic Algorithms","Food products; Function evaluation; Knowledge graph; Ontology; Quality control; Resource Description Framework (RDF); Semantics; Stochastic systems; User interfaces; Computational creativities; Creativity; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Ontology's; Recipe; Recipe evolution; Resources description frameworks; Genetic algorithms","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85165259066"

The editor allows creating an ontograph that describes the structure of the EER as well as the ability to assign to each node a context of all types supported by the browser, including html pages, web 2.0 resources, etc. The EER built in this way allows the integration of data from different sources with the ability to adapt to the conditions of any subject area, regardless of its specifics. Thus, the digital competencies of the EER creators remain relevant since they do not need to learn new software resources to work with individual ontology concepts (“ontograph nodes”). As a result of our research, we have developed a technology for using the ontological approach to create an EER. For its implementation, the Ontos.xyz resource was developed, which is an ontological graph editor. The ontograph allows for the primary visualization of the EER structure, interpreting its structural elements as nodes (vertices) of the graph and displaying the logic of transitions between structural elements in the form of directed links. With such an approach, the ontology is a kind of aggregator that ensures the integration of the semantic and technological approaches. Building an EER using the ontological approach requires appropriate technological support in terms of description languages, models, software tools, and systems. The proposed software solution, in contrast to its functional counterparts, focuses on use in the educational process. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Competence; Digital Technologies; Electronic Educational Resources; Ontological Approach In Education","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162170720"

Chinese medical entities have not been organized comprehensively due to the lack of well-developed terminology systems, which poses a challenge to processing Chinese medical texts for fine-grained medical knowledge representation. To unify Chinese medical terminologies, mapping Chinese medical entities to their English counterparts in the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) is an efficient solution. However, their mappings have not been investigated sufficiently in former research. In this study, we explore strategies for mapping Chinese medical entities to the UMLS and systematically evaluate the mapping performance. Methods. First, Chinese medical entities are translated to English using multiple web-based translation engines. Then, 3 mapping strategies are investigated: (a) string-based, (b) semantic-based, and (c) string and semantic similarity combined. In addition, cross-lingual pretrained language models are applied to map Chinese medical entities to UMLS concepts without translation. All of these strategies are evaluated on the ICD10-CN, Chinese Human Phenotype Ontology (CHPO), and RealWorld datasets. Results. The linear combination method based on the SapBERT and term frequency-inverse document frequency bag-of-words models perform the best on all evaluation datasets, with 91.85%, 82.44%, and 78.43% of the top 5 accuracies on the ICD10-CN, CHPO, and RealWorld datasets, respectively.

Currently, writing software requirements specifications primarily depends on human work. Although massive studies have been proposed to speed up the process via proposing advanced elicitation and analysis techniques, it is still a time-consuming and error-prone task, which needs to take domain knowledge and business information into consideration. In this paper, we propose an approach, named ReqGen, which can provide further assistance by automatically generating natural language requirements specifications based on certain given keywords. Specifically, ReqGen consists of three critical steps. First, keywords-oriented knowledge is selected from the domain ontology and is injected into the basic Unified pre-trained Language Model (UniLM) for domain fine-tuning. Second, a copy mechanism is integrated to ensure the occurrence of keywords in the generated statements. Finally, a requirements-syntax-constrained decoding is designed to close the semantic and syntax distance between the candidate and reference specifications. Experiments on two public datasets from different groups and domains show that ReqGen outperforms six popular natural language generation approaches with respect to the hard constraint of keywords’ (phrases’) inclusion, BLEU, ROUGE, and syntax compliance. We believe that ReqGen can promote the efficiency and intelligence of specifying software requirements. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Injection; Requirements Syntax; Software Requirements Generation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146761492"

This paper proposes a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component that enables end-to-end ASR models to bias towards a list of long-tail words obtained using external contextual information. With only a small overhead in memory use and computation cost, TCPGen can structure thousands of biasing words efficiently into a symbolic prefix-tree, and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output to facilitate the recognition of the biasing words. To enhance TCPGen, we further propose a novel minimum biasing word error (MBWE) loss that directly optimises biasing word errors during training, along with a biasing-word-driven language model discounting (BLMD) method during the test. All contextual ASR systems were evaluated on the public Librispeech audiobook corpus and the data from the dialogue state tracking challenges (DSTC) with the biasing lists extracted from the dialogue-system ontology. Consistent word error rate (WER) reductions were achieved with TCPGen, which were particularly significant on the biasing words with around 40% relative reductions in the recognition error rates. MBWE and BLMD further improved the effectiveness of TCPGen, and achieved more significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen also achieved zero-shot learning of words not in the audio training set with large WER reductions on the out-of-vocabulary words in the biasing list. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contextual Speech Recognition; End-to-end; Language Model Discounting; Minimum Bayes' Risk; Pointer Generator; Computational Linguistics; Errors; Speech Communication; Speech Processing; Zero-shot Learning; Contextual Knowledge; Contextual Speech Recognition; End To End; Language Model; Language Model Discounting; Long Tail; Minimum Bayes Risk; Pointer Generator; Recognition Error; Word Error Rate Reductions; Speech Recognition","Computational linguistics; Errors; Speech communication; Speech processing; Zero-shot learning; Contextual knowledge; Contextual speech recognition; End to end; Language model; Language model discounting; Long tail; Minimum bayes risk; Pointer generator; Recognition error; Word error rate reductions; Speech recognition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144075835"

We proposed a novel deep-learning method, ATGO, to predict Gene Ontology (GO) attributes of proteins through a triplet neural-network architecture embedded with pre-trained language models from protein sequences. The method was systematically tested on 1068 non-redundant benchmarking proteins and 3328 targets from the third Critical Assessment of Protein Function Annotation (CAFA) challenge. Experimental results showed that ATGO achieved a significant increase of the GO prediction accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art approaches in all aspects of molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. Detailed data analyses showed that the major advantage of ATGO lies in the utilization of pre-trained transformer language models which can extract discriminative functional pattern from the feature embeddings. Meanwhile, the proposed triplet network helps enhance the association of functional similarity with feature similarity in the sequence embedding space. In addition, it was found that the combination of the network scores with the complementary homology-based inferences could further improve the accuracy of the predicted models. These results demonstrated a new avenue for high-accuracy deep-learning function prediction that is applicable to large-scale protein function annotations from sequence alone. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Embeddings; Forecasting; Genes; Network Architecture; Proteins; Gene Ontology; Identification Of Proteins; Language Model; Learning Methods; Neural Network Architecture; Neural-networks; Protein Function Annotation; Protein Functions; Protein Genes; Protein Sequences; Gene Ontology; Accuracy; Animal Experiment; Arabidopsis; Article; Controlled Study; Deep Learning; Diagnostic Test Accuracy Study; Gene Ontology; Gene Product; Human; Language Model; Mouse; Nerve Cell Network; Nonhuman; Prediction; Probability; Protein Function; Sensitivity And Specificity; Sequence Homology; Validation Process; Biology; Genetics; Language; Metabolism; Procedures; Protein; Computational Biology; Language; Neural Networks, Computer","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Embeddings; Forecasting; Genes; Network architecture; Proteins; Gene ontology; Identification of proteins; Language model; Learning methods; Neural network architecture; Neural-networks; Protein function annotation; Protein functions; Protein genes; Protein sequences; Gene Ontology; accuracy; animal experiment; Arabidopsis; Article; controlled study; deep learning; diagnostic test accuracy study; gene ontology; gene product; human; language model; mouse; nerve cell network; nonhuman; prediction; probability; protein function; sensitivity and specificity; sequence homology; validation process; biology; genetics; language; metabolism; procedures; protein; Computational Biology; Language; Neural Networks, Computer","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144617184"

Nonetheless, the high computational costs associated with training these models have motivated alternative approaches for representation learning. Herein we introduce TripletProt, a new approach for protein representation learning based on the Siamese neural networks. Representation learning of biological entities which capture essential features can alleviate many of the challenges associated with supervised learning in bioinformatics. The most important distinction of our proposed method is relying on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The computational cost of the generated representations for any potential application is significantly lower than comparable methods since the length of the representations is significantly smaller than that in other approaches. TripletProt offers great potentials for the protein informatics tasks and can be widely applied to similar tasks. We evaluate TripletProt comprehensively in protein functional annotation tasks including sub-cellular localization (14 categories) and gene ontology prediction (more than 2000 classes), which are both challenging multi-class, multi-label classification machine learning problems. We compare the performance of TripletProt with the state-of-the-art approaches including a recurrent language model-based approach (i.e., UniRep), as well as a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sequence-based method (i.e., DeepGO). Our TripletProt showed an overall improvement of F1 score in the above mentioned comprehensive functional annotation tasks, solely relying on the PPI network.

They have yet to be demonstrated useful for protein function pre-diction. In particular, the problem of automatic annotation of proteins under the Gene Ontology (GO) framework remains open. This paper makes two key contributions. It debuts a novel method that leverages the transformer architecture in two ways. A sequence transformer encodes protein sequences in a task-agnostic feature space. A graph transformer learns a representation of GO terms while respecting their hierarchical relationships. The learned sequence and GO terms representations are combined and utilized for multi-label classification, with the labels corresponding to GO terms. The method is shown superior over recent representative GO prediction methods. The second major contribution in this paper is a deep investigation of different ways of constructing training and testing datasets. The paper shows that existing approaches under-or over-estimate the generalization power of a model. A novel approach is proposed to address these issues, resulting in a new benchmark dataset to rigorously evaluate and compare methods and advance the state-of-the-art. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Gene Ontology; Multi-modal Transformer; Protein Function; Protein; Proteins; Agnostic; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Gene Ontology; Gene Sequence; Human; Human Experiment; Multilabel Classification; Prediction; Protein Function; Genetics; Metabolism; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Gene Ontology; Proteins","Agnostic; amino acid sequence; article; gene ontology; gene sequence; human; human experiment; multilabel classification; prediction; protein function; genetics; metabolism; protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Gene Ontology; Proteins","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85142652245"

Here, we present recent extensions such as neural machine translation in 10 languages, neural classification of disease outbreak reports and a new cloud-based visualization dashboard. Furthermore, we discuss our vision for further improvements, including combining risk assessment with event semantics and assessing the risk of outbreaks with multi-granularity.

However, the actualization of this aspect has been challenging due to the difficulties associated with building knowledge bases and using formal languages to query them. In this regard, SPARQL, a recursive acronym for standard query language and protocol for Linked Open Data and Resource Description Framework databases, is a most popular formal querying language. Nonetheless, writing SPARQL queries is known to be difficult, even for experts. Natural language query formalization, which involves semantically parsing natural language queries to their formal language equivalents, has been an essential step in overcoming this steep learning curve. Recent work in the field has seen the usage of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques for language modelling with adequate accuracy.

However, owing to the characteristics of semantic vagueness and low signal-to-noise ratio, the web text is difficult to get utilized directly. Therefore, how to integrate the technologies of knowledge engineering, natural language processing and machine learning, so as to form a formalized domain knowledge graph from abundant tourism text, has attracted much attention. Methods This paper proposes a tourism knowledge graph construction method based on tourism domain ontology and transfer learning. Firstly, the ontology of tourist attractions is defined based on the domain specifications and standards, which support a comprehensive and systematic description of the semantic characteristics of attractions. Secondly, a transfer learning method is adopted to transform the pre-training language model into a customized knowledge extractor to acquire knowledge triples accurately from web text, which is integrated with the scattered tourism-related information including tourist check-ins and POI (point of interest) attributes to build a systematic knowledge graph. Results Experimental results show that the proposed knowledge extractor improves the accuracy (average area under the curve) and integrity (the number of sematic characteristics) of acquisition of sematic knowledge by 50.7% and 670%, respectively, compared with the common LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) model. The constructed knowledge graph of tourist attractions contained 77 039 entities, 16 types of relationship, and total 10 971 810 triples. Conclusions Through the unified organization paradigm of triplet knowledge, the study realizes the fusion and integration of multi-source heterogeneous tourism data, and addresses the potential systemic risk in the decision-making process based on a single data source. It is argued that the constructed knowledge graph can fully capture the real tourism scene, support in-depth analysis of tourist behaviors and demands at different scales and granularities, and provide decision support for sustainable developments of tourist destinations. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Knowledge Graph; Tourism Management; Transfer Learning; Web Text Mining; Decision Making; Decision Support Systems; Domain Knowledge; Engineering Education; Knowledge Acquisition; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Signal To Noise Ratio; Statistics; Graph-based; Information And Communication Technologies; Knowledge Graphs; Tourism Management; Tourism Services; Tourist Attractions; Transfer Learning; Web Text Mining; Web Texts; Web Transfers; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Based System; Machine Learning; Signal-to-noise Ratio; Tourism Development; Tourism Management; Tourist Destination","Decision making; Decision support systems; Domain Knowledge; Engineering education; Knowledge acquisition; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Signal to noise ratio; Statistics; Graph-based; Information and Communication Technologies; Knowledge graphs; Tourism management; Tourism services; Tourist attractions; Transfer learning; Web text mining; Web texts; Web transfers; Knowledge graph; knowledge based system; machine learning; signal-to-noise ratio; tourism development; tourism management; tourist destination","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85138141244"

While early systems evolved from keyword search and focused on simple factual queries, the complexity of both the input sentences as well as the generated SQL queries has evolved over time. More recently, there has also been a lot of focus on using conversational interfaces for data analytics, empowering a line of business owners and non-technical users with quick insights into the data. There are three main challenges in natural language querying: (1) identifying the entities involved in the user utterance, (2) connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying data source to interpret user intents, and finally (3) generating a structured query in the form of SQL or SPARQL. There are two main approaches in the literature for interpreting a user’s natural language query. Rule-based systems make use of semantic indices, ontologies, and knowledge graphs to identify the entities in the query, understand the intended relationships between those entities, and utilize grammars to generate the target queries. With the advances in deep learning-based language models, there have been many text-to-SQL approaches that try to interpret the query holistically using deep learning models. Hybrid approaches that utilize both rule-based techniques as well as deep learning models are also emerging by combining the strengths of both approaches. Conversational interfaces are the next natural step to one-shot natural language querying by exploiting query context between multiple turns of conversation for disambiguation. In this monograph, we review the background technologies that are used in natural language interfaces, and survey the different approaches to natural language querying. We also describe conversational interfaces for data analytics and discuss several benchmarks used for natural language querying research and evaluation. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Knowledge Graph; Natural Language Processing Systems; Search Engines; Semantics; Conversational Interface; Data Analytics; Keyword Search; Language Processing; Learning Models; Natural Language Interfaces; Natural Language Understanding; Natural Languages; Non-technical Users; Simple++; Data Analytics","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Knowledge graph; Natural language processing systems; Search engines; Semantics; Conversational interface; Data analytics; Keyword search; Language processing; Learning models; Natural language interfaces; Natural language understanding; Natural languages; Non-technical users; Simple++; Data Analytics","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146640292"

Structured data such as knowledge graphs and ontology libraries has been leveraged to benefit the few-shot setting in various tasks. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods suffer from challenging knowledge missing, knowledge noise, and knowledge heterogeneity, which hinder the performance for few-shot learning. In this study, we explore knowledge injection for FSL with pre-trained language models and propose ontology-enhanced prompt-tuning (OntoPrompt). Specifically, we develop the ontology transformation based on the external knowledge graph to address the knowledge missing issue, which fulfills and converts structure knowledge to text. We further introduce span-sensitive knowledge injection via a visible matrix to select informative knowledge to handle the knowledge noise issue. To bridge the gap between knowledge and text, we propose a collective training algorithm to optimize representations jointly. We evaluate our proposed OntoPrompt in three tasks, including relation extraction, event extraction, and knowledge graph completion, with eight datasets.

However, existing models and pretraining methods are designed and optimized for text analysis. We introduce ProteinBERT, a deep language model specifically designed for proteins. Our pretraining scheme combines language modeling with a novel task of Gene Ontology (GO) annotation prediction. We introduce novel architectural elements that make the model highly efficient and flexible to long sequences. The architecture of ProteinBERT consists of both local and global representations, allowing end-to-end processing of these types of inputs and outputs. ProteinBERT obtains near state-of-the-art performance, and sometimes exceeds it, on multiple benchmarks covering diverse protein properties (including protein structure, post-translational modifications and biophysical attributes), despite using a far smaller and faster model than competing deep-learning methods. Overall, ProteinBERT provides an efficient framework for rapidly training protein predictors, even with limited labeled data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Deep Learning; Gene Ontology; Human; Human Experiment; Language Test; Prediction; Protein Function; Protein Processing; Protein Structure; Chemistry; Language; Natural Language Processing; Protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Deep Learning; Language; Natural Language Processing; Proteins","amino acid sequence; article; deep learning; gene ontology; human; human experiment; language test; prediction; protein function; protein processing; protein structure; chemistry; language; natural language processing; protein; Amino Acid Sequence; Deep Learning; Language; Natural Language Processing; Proteins","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85128725695"

To accomplish this, a new model is developed to deduce the Semantic Learner Profile automatically. It adaptively associates the learning patterns and rules depending on the learner's behavior and the semantic relations computed in the semantic matrix that mutually links e-learning materials and terms. Here, a semantic-based approach for term expansion is introduced using DBpedia and WordNet ontologies. Further, various sentiment analysis models are proposed and incorporated as a part of the recommender system to predict ratings of e-learning resources from posted text reviews utilizing fine-grained sentiment classification on five discrete classes. Qualitative Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods with tailored-made Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) are developed and evaluated on our customized dataset collected for a specific domain and a public dataset. Two improved language models are introduced depending on Skip-Gram (S-G) and Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW) techniques. In addition, a robust language model based on hybridization of these couple of methods is developed to derive better vocabulary representation, yielding better accuracy 89.1% for the CNN-Three-Channel-Concatenation model. The suggested recommendation methodology depends on the learner's preferences, other similar learners’ experience and background, deriving their opinions from the reviews towards the best learning resources. This assists the learners in finding the desired e-content at the proper time. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adaptive Profiling; Convolutional Neural Network; Fine-grained Sentiment Analysis; Hybrid E-learning Recommendation; Semantic Learner Profile; Word Embeddings; Computational Linguistics; Convolution; Convolutional Neural Networks; E-learning; Learning Systems; Ontology; Recommender Systems; Semantic Web; Semantics; Adaptive Profiling; Convolutional Neural Network; E - Learning; Embeddings; Fine Grained; Fine-grained Sentiment Analyse; Hybrid E-learning Recommendation; Learner Profiles; Semantic Learner Profile; Sentiment Analysis; Word Embedding","Computational linguistics; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; E-learning; Learning systems; Ontology; Recommender systems; Semantic Web; Semantics; Adaptive profiling; Convolutional neural network; E - learning; Embeddings; Fine grained; Fine-grained sentiment analyse; Hybrid E-learning recommendation; Learner profiles; Semantic learner profile; Sentiment analysis; Word embedding","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122815302"

Novel data representation approaches mostly take inspiration from language models that have yielded ground-breaking improvements in natural language processing. Lately, these approaches have been applied to the field of protein science and have displayed highly promising results in terms of extracting complex sequence–structure–function relationships. In this study we conducted a detailed investigation over protein representation learning by first categorizing/explaining each approach, subsequently benchmarking their performances on predicting: (1) semantic similarities between proteins, (2) ontology-based protein functions, (3) drug target protein families and (4) protein–protein binding affinity changes following mutations.

The gene ontology (GO) directed acyclic graph (DAG) contains the hierarchical relationships between GO terms but is hard to be integrated into machine learning algorithms for functional predictions. We developed a deep learning system named PANDA2 to predict protein functions, which used the cutting-edge graph neural network to model the topology of the GO DAG and integrated the features generated by transformer protein language models.

Challenges in automating the mapping process stem from the idiosyncratic source encoding schemes adopted by different health systems and the lack of large publicly available training data. In this study, we aim to develop a scalable and generalizable machine learning tool to facilitate standardizing laboratory observations to the Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). Specifically, we leverage the contextual embedding from pre-Trained T5 models and propose a two-stage fine-Tuning strategy based on contrastive learning to enable learning in a few-shot setting without manual feature engineering. Our method utilizes unlabeled general LOINC ontology and data augmentation to achieve high accuracy on retrieving the most relevant LOINC targets when limited amount of labeled data are available. We further show that our model generalizes well to unseen targets. Taken together, our approach shows great potential to reduce manual effort in LOINC standardization and can be easily extended to mapping other terminologies. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Contrastive Learning; Data Standardization; Large Language Model; Loinc; Medical Entity Linking; Sentence Embedding; T5; Computational Linguistics; Mapping; Natural Language Processing Systems; Standardization; Terminology; Code Standardizations; Contrastive Learning; Data Standardization; Embeddings; Language Model; Large Language Model; Logical Observation Identifiers Names And Codes; Medical Entity Linking; Sentence Embedding; T5","Computational linguistics; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; Standardization; Terminology; Code standardizations; Contrastive learning; Data standardization; Embeddings; Language model; Large language model; Logical observation identifiers names and codes; Medical entity linking; Sentence embedding; T5","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85171421517"

As we move towards adaptable dialogue systems where knowledge about domains, slots and values may change, there is an increasing need to automatically extract these terms from raw dialogues or related non-dialogue data on a large scale. In this paper, we take an important step in this direction by exploring different features that can enable systems to discover realizations of domains, slots and values in dialogues in a purely data-driven fashion. The features that we examine stem from word embeddings, language modelling features, as well as topological features of the word embedding space. To examine the utility of each feature set, we train a seed model based on the widely used MultiWOZ data-set. Then, we apply this model to a different corpus, the Schema-Guided Dialogue data-set. Our method outperforms the previously proposed approach that relies solely on word embeddings. We also demonstrate that each of the features is responsible for discovering different kinds of content.

One of these activities is the classification of the domain entities (concepts and instances) according to top-level concepts. This activity is usually performed manually by an ontology engineer. However, when the set of entities increases in size, associating each domain entity to the proper top-level ontological concept becomes challenging and requires a high level of expertise in both the target domain and ontology engineering. In this context, this work describes an approach for learning domain ontologies based on top-level ontology concepts using informal definitions as input. In our approach, we used informal definitions of the domain entities as text input of a language model that predicts their proper top-level concepts. Also, we present a methodology to extract datasets from existing domain ontologies to evaluate the proposed approach.

However, they often result in poor performances when applied to domains that are different from those they are pretrained on. Continued pretraining using unlabeled data from target domains can help improve the performances of these language models on the downstream tasks. However, using all of the available unlabeled data for pretraining can be time-intensive; also, it can be detrimental to the performance of the downstream tasks, if the unlabeled data is not aligned with the data distribution for the target tasks. Previous works employed external supervision in the form of ontologies for selecting appropriate data samples for pretraining, but external supervision can be quite hard to obtain in low-resource domains. In this paper, we introduce effective ways to select data from unlabeled corpora of target domains for language model pretraining to improve the performances in target entity extraction tasks. Our data selection strategies do not require any external supervision. We conduct extensive experiments for the task of named entity recognition (NER) on seven different domains and show that language models pretrained on target domain unlabeled data obtained using our data selection strategies achieve better performances compared to those using data selection strategies in previous works that use external supervision. We also show that these pretrained language models using our data selection strategies outperform those pretrained on all of the available unlabeled target domain data. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Data Reduction; Data Selection Strategies; Down-stream; Entity Extractions; Language Model; Natural Languages; Performance; Pre-training; Resource Domains; Target Domain; Unlabeled Data; Extraction","Computational linguistics; Data reduction; Data selection strategies; Down-stream; Entity extractions; Language model; Natural languages; Performance; Pre-training; Resource domains; Target domain; Unlabeled data; Extraction","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149442616"

We consider a much larger and more diverse database of commercial Electronic Health Records than what is prevalent in the literature. We formulate a simplified version of diagnosis prediction that focuses on major developments in medical histories of patients. To this end, we leverage Auto-Regressive Self-Attention models that have seen promising applications in language modelling and extend them to incorporate ontological representations of medical codes. Additionally, we include time-intervals between diagnoses into the attention calculation. We evaluate models and baselines at different levels of diagnostic granularity and our results suggest that using very detailed clinical classifications does not significantly degrade performance, possibly allowing their use in practice.

To solve this problem, and for quality evaluation of descriptive answers online, an automatic evaluation methodology is proposed in this work. A language model is modelled from the expected answer key, and entity graphs are generated from the ontology modelled using the input answer to be evaluated. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like Stemming, Summarization, and Polarity Analysis are integrated in this work with Ontologies for the efficient evaluation of descriptive answers. Several challenges which come across evaluating descriptive answers are discussed in this chapter, and they have been solved in order to obtain a dynamic and robust evaluating system.

Developing computational models based on GO to automatically annotate protein functions has been a longstanding active research area. In this paper, we propose a novel method to adaptively fuse functional and topological information between GO Terms. Our method is composed of a pre-trained language model for encoding protein sequences and an adaptive multi-view graph convolutional network (Multi-view GCN) for representing GO terms. Particularly, the Multi-view GCN considers multiple views from functional information, topological structures, and their combinations, and extracts multiple corresponding representations of GO terms. Then, an attention mechanism is applied to adaptively learn the importance weights of these representations. Finally, the predicted scores are calculated by using a dot product between protein sequence features and GO term representations. Experimental results on the datasets of two species (i.e., Human and Yeast) show that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.

Sequence-based methods, one of the computational methods, have been developed for extending functional annotations to fast-growing sequence databases. We propose a novel sequence-based hierarchy-aware method, namely GCL-GO. GCL-GO applies a protein language model to represent sequences, applies graph contrastive learning to represent GO terms, and then predicts protein functions by combining these two features. By contrasting the GO graph and semantic features of GO terms, GCL-GO has generalizability and scalability by accurately embedding the features of GO terms while relying less on training data. We also suggest GCL-GO+, which combines a sequence similarity-based method with GCLGO, to improve performance. GCL-GO+ outperforms sequence-based competing methods on both the CAFA3 and the TALE datasets. Furthermore, GCL-GO and GCL-GO+ demonstrate functional generalization and scalability potential by having the best performance on new GO terms or on GO terms annotated infrequently in the training dataset.

Knowledge bases are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities and relations representing facts about the world. These facts follow a controlled vocabulary that drives the knowledge base, often called ontology. Entities are the graph nodes, while relations are the edges connecting the nodes. While knowledge base attention prolifer-ates, extracting information from these resources is challenging. One of the promising approaches is Question Answering systems. The Question Answering over Knowledge Base(KB-QA) system aims to provide a natural language interface to pose a query to the KB. QA systems use embeddings to map the posed Question to the facts stored in the knowledge bases. QA systems can be effectively improved using large transformer models. These transformer models are computationally expensive, which prevents their use in real-world applications. To solve this, we started our study with the use-case of Knowledge Base Question Answering systems. In KB-QA systems, representing the entities and relationships play a pivotal role in extracting the answer to the posed query. Traditional KB embedding techniques represent entities/relations as vectors, mapping them in different semantic spaces and ignoring the subtle cor-relation. A pre-training language model for encoding the KB facts will preserve the semantic and contextual correlation. While learning linguistic knowledge, these models also store relational knowledge in the training data. These Language Models are often trained on a massive corpus addressing the Out-Of- Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we incorporate a co-embedding model for knowledge base embedding, which learns low-dimensional representations of entities and relations in the same semantic space. We propose a Variational Auto-Encoder, an efficient transformer architecture that represents knowledge base representations as Gaussian distributions to address the issue of neglecting uncertainty. In addition, our method has high quality and interpretability advantages compared with previous methods. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the VAE approach for question-answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known pre-trained embedding methods. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Encoder; Kbqa; Knowledge Base Question Answering; Language Model; Multi-head Attention; Transformers; Vae; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Digital Storage; Knowledge Based Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Query Processing; Semantics; Signal Encoding; Vector Spaces; Bert; Encoder; Kbqa; Knowledge Base Question Answering; Language Model; Multi-head Attention; Qa System; Question Answering; Transformer; Vae; Embeddings","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Digital storage; Knowledge based systems; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Semantics; Signal encoding; Vector spaces; Bert; Encoder; KBQA; Knowledge base question answering; Language model; Multi-head attention; QA system; Question Answering; Transformer; VAE; Embeddings","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85146491190"

We revisit this task, and exploit recent advances in language modelling to synthesise homonymy annotation for Princeton WordNet. Previous approaches treat the problem using clustering methods; by contrast, our method works by linking WordNet to the Oxford English Dictionary, which contains the information we need. To perform this alignment, we pair definitions based on their proximity in an embedding space produced by a Transformer model. Despite the simplicity of this approach, our best model attains an F1 of .97 on an evaluation set that we annotate. The outcome of our work is a high-quality homonymy annotation layer for Princeton WordNet, which we release. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Homonymy; Oxford English Dictionary; Polysemy; Wordnet; Ontology; Best Model; Clustering Methods; Embeddings; Homonymy; Language Model; Oxford English Dictionary; Polysemy; Transformer Modeling; Word Meaning; Wordnet; Modeling Languages","Ontology; Best model; Clustering methods; Embeddings; Homonymy; Language model; Oxford english dictionary; Polysemy; Transformer modeling; Word meaning; Wordnet; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145881520"

In this paper, we present a new dataset, obtained by merging four publicly available annotated corpora for task-oriented dialogues in several domains (MultiWOZ 2.2, CamRest676, DSTC2 and Schema-Guided Dialogue Dataset). This way, we assess the feasibility of providing a unified ontology and annotation schema covering several domains with a relatively limited effort. We analyze the characteristics of the resulting dataset along three main dimensions: language, information content and performance. We focus on aspects likely to be pertinent for improving dialogue success, e.g. dialogue consistency. Furthermore, to assess the usability of this new corpus, we thoroughly evaluate dialogue generation performance under various conditions with the help of two prominent recent end-to-end dialogue models: MarCo and GPT-2. These models were selected as popular open implementations representative of the two main dimensions of dialogue modelling. While we did not observe a significant gain for dialogue state tracking performance, we show that using more training data from different sources can improve language modelling capabilities and positively impact dialogue flow (consistency). In addition, we provide the community with one of the largest open dataset for machine learning experiments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annotated Corpora; Resource Merging; Task Oriented Dialog; Modeling Languages; Annotated Corpus; Dialogue Generations; Dialogue Models; Information Contents; Language Informations; Ontology's; Performance; Resource Merging; Task Oriented Dialog; Task-oriented; Merging","Modeling languages; Annotated corpus; Dialogue generations; Dialogue models; Information contents; Language informations; Ontology's; Performance; Resource merging; Task oriented dialog; Task-oriented; Merging","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144429858"

Even though such models are criticised for poor interpretability, they still yield state-of-the-art solutions for a wide range of very different tasks. While many probing studies have been conducted to measure the models awareness of grammatical knowledge, semantic probing is less popular. In this work, we introduce a probing pipeline to study how semantic relations are represented in transformer language models. We show that in this task, attention scores express the information about relations similar to the layers' output activations despite their lesser ability to represent surface cues. This supports the hypothesis that attention mechanisms focus not only on syntactic relational information but semantic as well. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bertology; Explainable Ai (xai); Knowledge Probing; Language Models Interpretation; Ontology Extraction; Semantic Probing; Artificial Intelligence; Computational Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Bertology; Explainable Ai (xai); Knowledge Probing; Language Model; Language Model Interpretation; Model Interpretations; Natural Languages; Ontology Extraction; Semantic Probing; Semantic Relations; Semantics","Artificial intelligence; Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Bertology; Explainable AI (XAI); Knowledge probing; Language model; Language model interpretation; Model interpretations; Natural languages; Ontology Extraction; Semantic probing; Semantic relations; Semantics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144341878"

This drastically limits the usage of these models in niche domains for which they are not optimized, or where domain-specific training data is scarce. We focus here on the clinical domain because of its limited access to training data in common tasks, while structured ontological data is often readily available. Recent observations in model compression of transformer models show optimization potential in improving the representation capacity of attention heads. We propose KIMERA (Knowledge Injection via Mask Enforced Retraining of Attention) for detecting, retraining and instilling attention heads with complementary structured domain knowledge. Our novel multi-task training scheme effectively identifies and targets individual attention heads that are least useful for a given downstream task and optimizes their representation with information from structured data. KIMERA generalizes well, thereby building the basis for an efficient fine-tuning. KIMERA achieves significant performance boosts on seven datasets in the medical domain in Information Retrieval and Clinical Outcome Prediction settings. We apply KIMERA to BERT-base to evaluate the extent of the domain transfer and also improve on the already strong results of BioBERT in the clinical domain. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Language Modelling; Neural Language Representation Models; Semi-supervised; Statistical And Machine Learning Methods; Weakly-supervised And Unsupervised Learning; Computational Linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Supervised Learning; Domain Knowledge; Language Model; Machine Learning Methods; Neural Language Representation Model; Representation Model; Semi-supervised; Statistical Learning Methods; Supervised And Unsupervised Learning; Training Data; Weakly-supervised And Unsupervised Learning; Modeling Languages","Computational linguistics; Domain Knowledge; Supervised learning; Domain knowledge; Language model; Machine learning methods; Neural language representation model; Representation model; Semi-supervised; Statistical learning methods; Supervised and unsupervised learning; Training data; Weakly-supervised and unsupervised learning; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144338453"

The interactions often take place on semantic level for efficiency, but there is still a gap from semantic actions to natural language, which causes a mismatch between training and deployment environment. Incorporating a natural language generation (NLG) module with USs during training can partly deal with this problem. However, since the policy and NLG of USs are optimised separately, these simulated user utterances may not be natural enough in a given context. In this work, we propose a generative transformer-based user simulator (GenTUS). GenTUS consists of an encoder-decoder structure, which means it can optimise both the user policy and natural language generation jointly. GenTUS generates both semantic actions and natural language utterances, preserving interpretability and enhancing language variation. In addition, by representing the inputs and outputs as word sequences and by using a large pre-trained language model we can achieve generalisability in feature representation. We evaluate GenTUS with automatic metrics and human evaluation. Our results show that GenTUS generates more natural language and is able to transfer to an unseen ontology in a zero-shot fashion. In addition, its behaviour can be further shaped with reinforcement learning opening the door to training specialised user simulators. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Research; Computational Linguistics; Learning Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Speech Processing; Zero-shot Learning; Dialogue Systems; Encoder-decoder; Natural Language Generation; Natural Languages; Policy Language; Reinforcement Learnings; Semantic Action; Semantic Levels; Task-oriented; User Behaviors; Reinforcement Learning","Behavioral research; Computational linguistics; Learning systems; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Speech processing; Zero-shot learning; Dialogue systems; Encoder-decoder; Natural language generation; Natural languages; Policy language; Reinforcement learnings; Semantic action; Semantic levels; Task-oriented; User behaviors; Reinforcement learning","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85144185855"

With the increasing computational power, current protein language models pre-trained with millions of diverse sequences can advance the parameter scale from million-level to billion-level and achieve remarkable improvement. However, those prevailing approaches rarely consider incorporating knowledge graphs (KGs), which can provide rich structured knowledge facts for better protein representations. We argue that informative biology knowledge in KGs can enhance protein representation with external knowledge. In this work, we propose OntoProtein, the first general framework that makes use of structure in GO (Gene Ontology) into protein pre-training models. We construct a novel large-scale knowledge graph that consists of GO and its related proteins, and gene annotation texts or protein sequences describe all nodes in the graph. We propose novel contrastive learning with knowledge-aware negative sampling to jointly optimize the knowledge graph and protein embedding during pre-training. Experimental results show that OntoProtein can surpass state-of-the-art methods with pre-trained protein language models in TAPE benchmark and yield better performance compared with baselines in protein-protein interaction and protein function prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Benchmarking; Computational Linguistics; Gene Ontology; Genes; Graph Embeddings; Knowledge Graph; Computational Power; Embeddings; External Knowledge; Gene Ontology; Knowledge Graphs; Language Model; Power Current; Pre-training; Structured Knowledge; Training Model; Proteins","Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Gene Ontology; Genes; Graph embeddings; Knowledge graph; Computational power; Embeddings; External knowledge; Gene ontology; Knowledge graphs; Language model; Power current; Pre-training; Structured knowledge; Training model; Proteins","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143658405"

While ontologies are being created as formal specifications of shared conceptualizations of application domains, different users often create different ontologies to represent the same domain. For better reasoning about concepts in scientific papers, it is desired to pick the ontology which best matches concepts present in the input text. We have started to automatize this process and attack the problem by utilizing state-of-the-art NLP tools and neural networks. Given a specific set of ontologies, we experiment with different training pipelines for NLP machine learning models with the aim to construct representative embeddings for the text-to-ontology matching task. We assess the final result through visualizing the latent space and exploring the mappings between an input text and ontology classes. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Fasttext; Language Models; Matching Text To Ontologies; Text Analysis; Learning Algorithms; Mapping; Natural Language Processing Systems; Bert; Fasttext; Language Model; Language Processing; Matching Text To Ontology; Matchings; Natural Languages; Ontology Mapping; Ontology's; Text Analysis; Ontology","Learning algorithms; Mapping; Natural language processing systems; BERT; Fasttext; Language model; Language processing; Matching text to ontology; Matchings; Natural languages; Ontology mapping; Ontology's; Text analysis; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85139875540"

So much, in fact, that recent work by Clark et al. (2021) has reported that conventional crowdsourcing can no longer reliably distinguish between machine-authored (GPT-3) and human-authored writing. As errors in machine generations become ever subtler and harder to spot, it poses a new challenge to the research community for robust machine text evaluation. We propose a new framework called SCARECROW for scrutinizing machine text via crowd annotation. To support the broad range of real machine errors that can be identified by laypeople, the ten error categories of SCARECROW-such as redundancy, commonsense errors, and incoherence -are identified through several rounds of crowd annotation experiments without a predefined ontology. We then use SCARECROW to collect over 41k error spans in human-written and machine-generated paragraphs of English language news text. We isolate factors for detailed analysis, including parameter count, training data, and various decoding-time configurations. Our approach successfully quantifies measurable gaps between human authored text and generations from models of several sizes, including fourteen configurations of GPT-3. In addition, our analysis unveils new insights, with detailed rationales provided by laypeople, e.g., that the commonsense capabilities have been improving with larger models while math capabilities have not, and that the choices of simple decoding hyperparameters can make remarkable differences on the perceived quality of machine text.

In particular, we formulate the task as an answer selection problem, fine-tune the trained language model with the help of an external source of knowledge (e.g., FoodOn ontology), and establish a baseline for this task.

The proposed solution combines classical rule-based and dictionary-based approaches for name entity recognition (NER) with more advanced deep learning methods to identify different categories of medical terms, as well as some nested objects. The following categories of medical terms are currently identified: symptoms, complaints, diagnoses, anatomical organs and systems, risk factors, and family history. In addition, the negation relation and its scope are recognized. The location relation was modeled for connecting different categories of symptoms and complaints to anatomical organs and systems. All identified concepts were normalized to medical standard classifications and ontologies like UMLS, MESH, ICD-10 and mapped into the concepts of the linked open data Knowledge Graph WikiData. The proposed approach for automatic medical terms and their relations recognition shows high accuracy. The rule-based method shows an F1-score of 75%, while the trained BERT-based model presents an F1 score of 73%. Although the BERT model performs slightly worse on the test set, observations show that it finds objects in sentences that are not covered by the rule-based method. For the object linking task, the developed method based on the BERT language model shows a 61% F1 result, significantly outperforming direct string comparison, which achieves an F1 result of 45%. The developed user interface allows direct application of the annotation tool for individual texts. The service API outputs data in JSON format, which enables interoperability with other systems and can be used to process large collections of clinical data. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Annotation Tools; Deep Learning; Health Informatics; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Application Programming Interfaces (api); Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Knowledge Graph; Learning Algorithms; Learning Systems; Medical Informatics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Open Data; User Interfaces; Annotation Tool; Automatic Annotation; Health Informatics; Language Processing; Machine-learning; Medical Terms; Natural Language Processing; Natural Languages; Rule-based Method; Interoperability","Application programming interfaces (API); Deep learning; Diagnosis; Knowledge graph; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Medical informatics; Natural language processing systems; Open Data; User interfaces; Annotation tool; Automatic annotation; Health informatics; Language processing; Machine-learning; Medical terms; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Rule-based method; Interoperability","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137180843"

Therefore, understanding natural language is an ongoing challenge in the field of Question Answering. To make the process from the question to the answer, the QA pipeline can be broken down to several sub-steps, as e.g. prediction of the potential type of the answer, entity linking and detection of references for properties relevant for the formal query. The SMART Task challenge, co-located with ISWC 2021, focussed on two of these sub-tasks: relation linking and answer type prediction. With this paper, we present our approach for the latter task. Our solution is a two-staged process combining two separate multi-label classification tasks. For the answer category prediction, we utilize the RoBERTa language model. Questions predicted as resource questions are then further classified regarding the concrete answer types - a list of ontology classes - utilizing the BERT language model. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Answertype Prediction; Question Answering; Semantic Web; Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Query Processing; Semantic Web; Answertype Prediction; Broken Down; Co-located; Language Model; Natural Languages; Property; Question Answering; Semantic-web; Subtask; Type Predictions; Forecasting","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Query processing; Semantic Web; Answertype prediction; Broken down; Co-located; Language model; Natural languages; Property; Question Answering; Semantic-Web; Subtask; Type predictions; Forecasting","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129222847"

We combine Semantic Web technologies with Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing with the aim of converting human-readable best evidence/ practice for COVID-19 into that which is computer-interpretable. We present the results of experiments with 1212 clinical ideas (medical terms and expressions) from two UK national healthcare services specialty guides for COVID-19 and three versions of two BMJ Best Practice documents for COVID-19. The paper seeks to recognise and categorise clinical ideas, performing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) task, with an ontology providing extra terms as context and describing the intended meaning of categories understandable by clinicians. The paper investigates: 1) the performance of classical NER using MetaMap versus NER with fine-tuned BERT models; 2) the integration of both NER approaches using a lightweight ontology developed in close collaboration with senior doctors; and 3) the easy interpretation by junior doctors of the main classes from the ontology once populated with NER results.

Only a tiny fraction (<0.1%) of protein sequences has experimentally determined functional annotations. Computational methods may predict protein function very quickly, but their accuracy is not very satisfactory. Based upon recent breakthroughs in protein structure prediction and protein language models, we develop GAT-GO, a graph attention network (GAT) method that may substantially improve protein function prediction by leveraging predicted structure information and protein sequence embedding. Our experimental results show that GAT-GO greatly outperforms the latest sequence- and structure-based deep learning methods. On the PDB-mmseqs testset where the train and test proteins share <15% sequence identity, our GAT-GO yields Fmax (maximum F-score) 0.508, 0.416, 0.501, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) 0.427, 0.253, 0.411 for the MFO, BPO, CCO ontology domains, respectively, much better than the homology-based method BLAST (Fmax 0.117, 0.121, 0.207 and AUPRC 0.120, 0.120, 0.163) that does not use any structure information. On the PDB-cdhit testset where the training and test proteins are more similar, although using predicted structure information, our GAT-GO obtains Fmax 0.637, 0.501, 0.542 for the MFO, BPO, CCO ontology domains, respectively, and AUPRC 0.662, 0.384, 0.481, significantly exceeding the just-published method DeepFRI that uses experimental structures, which has Fmax 0.542, 0.425, 0.424 and AUPRC only 0.313, 0.159, 0.193. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Gene Ontology; Graph Attention Networks; Machine Learning; Protein Function Prediction; Amino Acid Sequence; Article; Attention Network; Deep Learning; Embedding; Gene Ontology; Human; Human Experiment; Language; Machine Learning; Prediction; Protein Domain; Protein Function; Protein Structure; Recall","amino acid sequence; article; attention network; deep learning; embedding; gene ontology; human; human experiment; language; machine learning; prediction; protein domain; protein function; protein structure; recall","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126708344"

Although the current state of the art involves the use of neural network language models as a post-processing step, the very large number of ontology classes to be recognized and the limited amount of gold-standard training data has impeded the creation of end-to-end systems based entirely on machine learning. Recently, Hailu et al. recast the concept recognition problem as a type of machine translation and demonstrated that sequence-to-sequence machine learning models have the potential to outperform multi-class classification approaches. Methods: We systematically characterize the factors that contribute to the accuracy and efficiency of several approaches to sequence-to-sequence machine learning through extensive studies of alternative methods and hyperparameter selections. We not only identify the best-performing systems and parameters across a wide variety of ontologies but also provide insights into the widely varying resource requirements and hyperparameter robustness of alternative approaches. Analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of such systems suggest promising avenues for future improvements as well as design choices that can increase computational efficiency with small costs in performance. Results: Bidirectional encoder representations from transformers for biomedical text mining (BioBERT) for span detection along with the open-source toolkit for neural machine translation (OpenNMT) for concept normalization achieve state-of-the-art performance for most ontologies annotated in the CRAFT Corpus. This approach uses substantially fewer computational resources, including hardware, memory, and time than several alternative approaches. Conclusions: Machine translation is a promising avenue for fully machine-learning-based concept recognition that achieves state-of-the-art results on the CRAFT Corpus, evaluated via a direct comparison to previous results from the 2019 CRAFT shared task. Experiments illuminating the reasons for the surprisingly good performance of sequence-to-sequence methods targeting ontology identifiers suggest that further progress may be possible by mapping to alternative target concept representations.

Since experimental validation of protein-phenotype associations is prohibitive, automated tools capable of accurately extracting these associations from the biomedical text are in high demand. However, while the manual annotation of protein-phenotype co-mentions required for training such models is highly resource-consuming, extracting millions of unlabeled co-mentions is straightforward. Results: In this study, we propose a novel deep semi-supervised ensemble framework that combines deep neural networks, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning for classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions with the help of unlabeled data. This framework allows the ability to incorporate an extensive collection of unlabeled sentence-level co-mentions of human proteins and phenotypes with a small labeled dataset to enhance overall performance. We develop PPPredSS, a prototype of our proposed semi-supervised framework that combines sophisticated language models, convolutional networks, and recurrent networks. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach provides a new state-of-the-art performance in classifying human protein-phenotype co-mentions by outperforming other supervised and semi-supervised counterparts. Furthermore, we highlight the utility of PPPredSS in powering a curation assistant system through case studies involving a group of biologists. Conclusions: This article presents a novel approach for human protein-phenotype co-mention classification based on deep, semi-supervised, and ensemble learning.

Computational methods bridge this sequence-annotation gap typically through homology-based annotation transfer by identifying sequence-similar proteins with known function or through prediction methods using evolutionary information. Here, we propose predicting GO terms through annotation transfer based on proximity of proteins in the SeqVec embedding rather than in sequence space. These embeddings originate from deep learned language models (LMs) for protein sequences (SeqVec) transferring the knowledge gained from predicting the next amino acid in 33 million protein sequences. Replicating the conditions of CAFA3, our method reaches an F<inf>max</inf> of 37 ± 2%, 50 ± 3%, and 57 ± 2% for BPO, MFO, and CCO, respectively. Numerically, this appears close to the top ten CAFA3 methods. When restricting the annotation transfer to proteins with < 20% pairwise sequence identity to the query, performance drops (F<inf>max</inf> BPO 33 ± 2%, MFO 43 ± 3%, CCO 53 ± 2%); this still outperforms naïve sequence-based transfer. Preliminary results from CAFA4 appear to confirm these findings.

To that end, we address three issues: First, the problem of predicting a word given previous words in a text. Usually, the context words are treated as a directional sequence. In our approach, we introduce a set-based class language model with order-independence, modeling the context words as a set of classes. Second, towards the task of predicting the next word's class based on the classes of previous words plus an incomplete word prefix, we present a Bayesian framework that incorporates the set-based class language model in conjunction with an ontology. Third, regarding the auto-complete problem, we provide complete query suggestions via abstract class-space search which determines similar historical queries that contain the classes of previous words plus the next word's predicted class. Subsequently, we apply the model to auto-complete inference in a system setting, in which users can access data via natural language queries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Auto-complete; Bayesian Inference; Class-based Language Model; Order-independence; Abstracting; Bayesian Networks; Computational Linguistics; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Auto-complete; Bayesian Inference; Class-based; Class-based Language Model; Context-word; Independent Model; Language Model; Natural Languages; Order Independents; Order-independence; Inference Engines","Abstracting; Bayesian networks; Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Auto-complete; Bayesian inference; Class-based; Class-based language model; Context-word; Independent model; Language model; Natural languages; Order independents; Order-independence; Inference engines","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85118311810"

Root cause analysis and risk assessment are crucial elements for success in fulfilling these demands. As a result, there is an ever-growing number of technical documents, which potentially contain valuable information serving as a base to inform development and production. Experts need to cope with this large number of technical documents, for example, to generate new hypotheses to identify possible root causes of deviations or potential risks in the ramp-up and production phase of new products. Unfortunately, most of the technical documents are unstructured, making processing them even more tedious. New advances in computer science, specifically artificial intelligence (AI), open the door for a higher degree of automation of knowledge management tools to support experts. Knowledge bases such as knowledge graphs allow for representing complex information but need to be created for each domain. Novel state-of-the-art graph embedding algorithms showed promising results in complementing knowledge bases with new relations. Complementary to knowledge base completion, language models trained on large textual corpora have demonstrated their ability to capture complex semantics. This paper proposes a new expert system concept for failure root cause analysis and risk assessment in the semiconductor industry, which leverages the advanced graph embeddings in combination with language models. The main challenges in this setting are the type of relations of interest, which are causal, and the language being used, which is highly domain-specific. Thus, we devised AI for consistency improvement of the data, predicting new links, and information extraction from unstructured data. The information extraction is conducted by levaraging domain specific ontologies and by focusing on presence of causal language. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Consistency Improvement; Convolutional Neural Network; Expert System; Information Extraction; Knowledge Graph; Knowledge Representation; Link Prediction; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Recurrent Neural Network; Root Cause Analysis And Risk Assessment; Semiconductor Industry; Text Classification","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184845907"

In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge-aware slot tagging model to integrate contextual representation of input text and the large-scale lexical background knowledge. Besides, we use multi-level graph attention to explicitly reason via lexical relations. We aim to leverage both linguistic regularities covered by deep language models (LM) and high-quality background knowledge derived from curated knowledge bases (KB). Consequently, our model could infer rare and unseen words in the test dataset by incorporating contextual semantics learned from the training dataset and lexical relations from ontology. The experiments show that our proposed knowledge integration mechanism achieves consistent improvements across settings with different sizes of training data on two public benchmark datasets. We also show through detailed analysis that incorporating background knowledge effectively alleviates issues of data scarcity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Background Knowledge; Contextual Representation; Knowledge Integration; Multi-level Graph Attention; Slot Tagging; Statistical Tests; Background Knowledge; Context-aware; Context-aware Models; Contextual Representation; Knowledge Integration; Language Understanding; Lexical Relations; Multi-level Graph Attention; Slot Tagging; State-of-the-art Performance; Semantics; Article; Attention; Human; Human Experiment; Knowledge Base; Language; Ontology; Semantics","Statistical tests; Background knowledge; Context-Aware; Context-aware models; Contextual representation; Knowledge integration; Language understanding; Lexical relations; Multi-level graph attention; Slot tagging; State-of-the-art performance; Semantics; article; attention; human; human experiment; knowledge base; language; ontology; semantics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85103687677"

Following initial word-level embedding methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and topic-based bag-of-words approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the focus has turned to language models and text encoders implemented as neural networks - ranging from word-level models to those embedding whole documents. The distinctive feature of these models is their ability to infer semantic spaces at all levels based purely on data, with no need for complexities such as syntactic analysis or ontology building. Many of these models are available pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, providing downstream applications with general-purpose semantic spaces. In particular, embedding models at the sentence level or higher are most useful in applications because the meaning of text only becomes clear at that level. Most text embedding methods produce text embeddings in high-dimensional spaces, with a dimensionality ranging from a few hundred to thousands. However, it is often useful to visualize semantic spaces in very low dimension, which requires the use of dimensionality reduction methods. It is not clear what language models and what method of dimensionality reduction would work well in these cases. In this paper, we compare four text embedding methods in combination with three methods of dimensionality reduction to map three related real-world datasets comprising textual descriptions of items in a particular domain (sports) to a 2-dimensional semantic visualization space. The results provide several insights into the utility of these methods for data of this type. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Language Models; Semantic Spaces; Semantic Visualization; Text Embedding; Computational Linguistics; Information Retrieval; Natural Language Processing Systems; Semantics; Statistics; Syntactics; Visualization; Comparatives Studies; Dimensionality Reduction; Embedding Method; Embeddings; Language Model; Semantic Embedding; Semantic Space; Semantic Visualization; Text Embedding; Word Level","Computational linguistics; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Semantics; Statistics; Syntactics; Visualization; Comparatives studies; Dimensionality reduction; Embedding method; Embeddings; Language model; Semantic embedding; Semantic Space; Semantic visualization; Text embedding; Word level","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85116441915"

A gap could exist between user information needs and his/her defined context as the level of the user's expertise in the search domain is directly influencing the query richness. The information retrieval system (IRS) must be intelligent enough to identify information needs and respond effectively to meet the expected needs, regardless the level of user's expertise level. This process is difficult and it remains a major and open challenge in the domain of IR. IR models integrate many sources to achieve an effective retrieval system.

The paper introduces inverse ontology cogency as a new alternative method. It is a novel distance measure used in selecting the optimum mapping between ontology-specified concepts and phrases in free-form text. We also apply a multi-layer perceptron and text processing method for named entity recognition as an alternative to recurrent neural network methods. Automated named entity recognition, or concept recognition, is a common task in natural language processing. Similarities between confabulation theory and existing language models are discussed. This paper provides comparisons to MetaMap from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), a popular tool used in medicine to map free-form text to concepts in a medical ontology. The NLM provides a manually annotated database from the medical literature with concepts labeled, a unique, valuable source of ground truth, permitting comparison with MetaMap performance. Comparisons for different feature set combinations are made to demonstrate the effectiveness of inverse ontology cogency for entity recognition. Results indicate that using both inverse ontology cogency and corpora cogency improved concept recognition precision 20% over the best published MetaMap results. This demonstrates a new, effective approach for identifying medical concepts in text.

However, these are easily misled by biased samples, resulting in learning some ill-suited rules that limit their potential. The information of some specific part-of-speech (POS) categories often indicates the word sentiment polarity, which can be introduced as prior knowledge to facilitate prediction of the model. Accordingly, we propose an interactive POS-aware network (IPAN) that explicitly introduces the POS information as reliable guidance to assist the model in accurately predicting sentiment polarity. We distinguish the information of different POS categories using a POS-filter gate and reinforce the features extracted from adjectives, adverbs, and verbs via a POS-highlighting attention mechanism. This enables the model to concentrate on the words that contain significant sentiment orientations and to obtain the most practical learning experience. To emphasize the target information, we construct a target-context gate that enables the interaction of the target information with contexts; consequently, the model considerably focuses on target-related sentiment features. The experiments on SemEval2014 and Twitter datasets verify that our IPAN consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aspect-level Sentiment Classification; Attention Mechanism; Gating Mechanism; Part-of-speech; Conceptnet; Emosenticnet; Ontosenticnet; Opinionfinder; Python; Senticnet; Sentiwordnet; Wordnet; Learning Systems; Predictive Analytics; Attention Mechanisms; Learning Experiences; Part Of Speech; Prior Knowledge; Sentiment Classification; Sentiment Features; State-of-the-art Methods; Target Information; Classification (of Information); Accuracy; Affect; Affective Computing; Article; Aspect Level Sentiment Analysis; Aspect Level Sentiment Classification; Association; Attention; Bayesian Learning; Bidirectional Long Short Term Memory; Big Data; Book; Classification; Classification Algorithm; Computer Model; Convolutional Neural Network; Data Analysis; Decision Making; Decision Tree; Deep Learning; Embedding Layer; Emotional Intelligence; Emotional Orientation; Emotionality; Fuzzy Clustering; Gated Linear Unit; Gated Recurrent Unit; Gated Relu Unit; Gated Tanh Relu Unit; Grammar; Human; Interactive Part Of Speech Aware Network; Knowledge; Language Development; Language Network; Logistic Regression Analysis; Multi Grained Attention Network; Natural Language Processing; Online Social Network; Ontology; Orientation; Part Of Speech Filter Gate Mechanism; Part Of Speech Highlighting Attention Mechanism; Pre Trained Language Model; Prediction; Priority Journal; Psychologic Assessment; Psychological Model; Recurrent Neural Network; Reliability; Sarcasm Detection; Semantic Feature Extraction Layer; Semantic Orientation; Semantics; Sentiment Expression; Sentiment Lexicon; Social Data Analysis; Software; Statistical Analysis; Statistical Bias; Statistical Model; Statistical Parameters; Support Vector Machine; Target Context Gating Mechanism; Task Performance; Thinking; Transfer Capsule Network; Trend Study; Validity; Word Emotion Association; Word Processing; Word Sense Disambiguation; Word Sentiment Polarity","Learning systems; Predictive analytics; Attention mechanisms; Learning experiences; Part Of Speech; Prior knowledge; Sentiment classification; Sentiment features; State-of-the-art methods; Target information; Classification (of information); accuracy; affect; affective computing; Article; aspect level sentiment analysis; aspect level sentiment classification; association; attention; Bayesian learning; bidirectional long short term memory; big data; book; classification; classification algorithm; computer model; convolutional neural network; data analysis; decision making; decision tree; deep learning; embedding layer; emotional intelligence; emotional orientation; emotionality; fuzzy clustering; gated linear unit; gated recurrent unit; gated ReLU unit; gated Tanh Relu unit; grammar; human; interactive part of speech aware network; knowledge; language development; language network; logistic regression analysis; multi grained attention network; natural language processing; online social network; ontology; orientation; part of speech filter gate mechanism; part of speech highlighting attention mechanism; pre trained language model; prediction; priority journal; psychologic assessment; psychological model; recurrent neural network; reliability; sarcasm detection; semantic feature extraction layer; semantic orientation; semantics; sentiment expression; sentiment lexicon; social data analysis; software; statistical analysis; statistical bias; statistical model; statistical parameters; support vector machine; target context gating mechanism; task performance; thinking; transfer capsule network; trend study; validity; word emotion association; word processing; word sense disambiguation; word sentiment polarity","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85092335288"

Speech also plays a major role in air traffic control (ATC) as voice communication between air traffic controllers (ATCos) and pilots is essential for ensuring safe and efficient air traffic. This communication is still analogue and ATCos are forced to enter the same communication content again into digital systems with additional input devices. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a solution to automate this digitization process and an important necessity in optimizing ATCo workflow. This paper investigates the applicability of DeepSpeech, an open source, easy to adapt, end-to-end speech recognition engine from the Mozilla Corporation, as a speech-to-text solution for ATC speech. Different training approaches such as training a model from scratch and adapting a model pre-trained on non-ATC speech are explored. Model adaptation is performed by employing techniques such as fine-tuning, transfer learning, and layer freezing. Furthermore, the effect of employing an additional language model in conjunction with the end-to-end trained model is evaluated and shown to lead to a considerable relative improvement of 61% in word error rate. Overall, a word error rate of 6.0% is achieved on voice recordings from operational and simulation environment of different airspaces, resulting in command recognition rates between 85% and 97%. The achieved results show that DeepSpeech is a highly relevant solution for ATC-speech, especially when considering that it includes easy to use adaptation mechanisms also for non-experts in speech recognition. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Air Traffic Control; Asr; Atc; Automatic Speech Recognition; Deepspeech; Domain Adaptation; Ontology; Air Navigation; Character Recognition; Control Towers; Digital Devices; Engines; Information Systems; Information Use; Learning Systems; Speech Recognition; Air Traffic Controller; Automatic Speech Recognition; Control Environment; Deepspeech; Domain Adaptation; End To End; Human Speech; Ontology's; Word Error Rate; Air Traffic Control","Air navigation; Character recognition; Control towers; Digital devices; Engines; Information systems; Information use; Learning systems; Speech recognition; Air traffic controller; Automatic speech recognition; Control environment; Deepspeech; Domain adaptation; End to end; Human speech; Ontology's; Word error rate; Air traffic control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160763592"

To accomplish this task, a CSP system needs to model the relation between the unstructured language utterance and the structured ontology while representing the multi-turn dynamics of the dialog. Pre-trained language models (LMs) are the state-of-the-art for various natural language processing tasks. However, existing pre-trained LMs that use language modeling training objectives over free-form text have limited ability to represent natural language references to contextual structural data. In this work, we present SCORE, a new pre-training approach for CSP tasks designed to induce representations that capture the alignment between the dialogue flow and the structural context. We demonstrate the broad applicability of SCORE to CSP tasks by combining SCORE with strong base systems on four different tasks (SPARC, COSQL, MWOZ, and SQA). We show that SCORE can improve the performance over all these base systems by a significant margin and achieves state-of-the-art results on three of them. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Base Systems; Context Representation; Conversational Semantics; Language Model; Natural Language Queries; Natural Languages; Ontology's; Pre-training; Semantic Parsing; State Of The Art; Formal Languages","Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Base systems; Context representation; Conversational semantics; Language model; Natural language queries; Natural languages; Ontology's; Pre-training; Semantic parsing; State of the art; Formal languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85145975337"

To address this challenge, we propose SAPBERT, a pretraining scheme that self-aligns the representation space of biomedical entities. We design a scalable metric learning framework that can leverage UMLS, a massive collection of biomedical ontologies with 4M+ concepts. In contrast with previous pipeline-based hybrid systems, SAPBERT offers an elegant one-model-for-all solution to the problem of medical entity linking (MEL), achieving a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on six MEL benchmarking datasets. In the scientific domain, we achieve SOTA even without task-specific supervision. With substantial improvement over various domain-specific pretrained MLMs such as BIOBERT, SCIBERT and PUBMEDBERT, our pretraining scheme proves to be both effective and robust. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Semantics; Biomedical Domain; Entity-level; Fine Grained; Language Model; Model Entities; Pre-training; Self-align; Self-alignment; Semantic Relationships; State Of The Art; Hybrid Systems","Computational linguistics; Semantics; Biomedical domain; Entity-level; Fine grained; Language model; Model entities; Pre-training; Self-align; Self-alignment; Semantic relationships; State of the art; Hybrid systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85137694463"

In most of the existing automated compliance checking (ACC) systems, the integration of the IFC schema and natural language is realized through hardcoding or predefined rules, ontologies, or dictionaries. These methods require intensive manual engineering effort and are often rigid and difficult to generalize. There is, thus, a need for an automated and meanwhile flexible and generalizable information integration method. To address this need, this paper leverages transformer-based language models to learn the semantic representations of concepts in the building information models (BIMs) and regulatory documents. An automated IFC-regulatory information integration approach based on these learned semantic representations is proposed. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposed approach achieved promising performance-an accuracy of 80%-on integrating IFC and regulatory concepts. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automation; Compliance Control; Information Retrieval; Information Theory; Modeling Languages; Semantics; Structural Design; Automated Compliance Checking; Building Design; Building Information Modelling; Hardcoding; Information Integration; Model-based Opc; Natural Languages; Schema Language; Semantic Gap; Semantic Representation; Architectural Design","Automation; Compliance control; Information retrieval; Information theory; Modeling languages; Semantics; Structural design; Automated compliance checking; Building design; Building Information Modelling; Hardcoding; Information integration; Model-based OPC; Natural languages; Schema language; Semantic gap; Semantic representation; Architectural design","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85132574650"

This can be a barrier to model uptake in important domains such as biomedicine. There has been recent work on general interpretable representation learning (Onoe and Durrett, 2020), but these domain-agnostic representations do not readily transfer to the important domain of biomedicine. In this paper, we create a new entity type system and training set from a large corpus of biomedical texts by mapping entities to concepts in a medical ontology, and from these to Wikipedia pages whose categories are our types. From this mapping we derive Biomedical Interpretable Entity Representations (BIERs), in which dimensions correspond to fine-grained entity types, and values are predicted probabilities that a given entity is of the corresponding type. We propose a novel method that exploits BIER's final sparse and intermediate dense representations to facilitate model and entity type debugging. We show that BIERs achieve strong performance in biomedical tasks including named entity disambiguation and entity label classification, and we provide error analysis to highlight the utility of their interpretability, particularly in low-supervision settings. Finally, we provide our induced 68K biomedical type system, the corresponding 37 million triples of derived data used to train BIER models and our best performing model. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Biomedical Text; Domain Agnostics; Entity-types; Interpretable Representation; Language Model; Large Corpora; Model Uptakes; Performance; Training Sets; Type Systems; Mapping","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Biomedical text; Domain agnostics; Entity-types; Interpretable representation; Language model; Large corpora; Model uptakes; Performance; Training sets; Type systems; Mapping","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123917151"

In this paper, we investigate the application and performance of different deep learning transformers for automatic encoding in ICD-10 of clinical texts in Bulgarian. The comparative analysis attempts to find which approach is more efficient to be used for fine-tuning of pre-trained BERT family transformer to deal with a specific domain terminology on a rare language such as Bulgarian. On the one hand, we use SlavicBERT and MultiligualBERT models, which are pre-trained for a common vocabulary in Bulgarian but lack medical terminology. On the other hand, we compare them to BioBERT, ClinicalBERT, SapBERT, BlueBERT models, which are pretrained for medical terminology in English, but lack training for language models in Bulgarian, and vocabulary in Cyrillic. In our research study, all BERT models are fine-tuned with additional medical texts in Bulgarian and then applied to the classification task for encoding medical diagnoses in Bulgarian into ICD-10 codes. A big corpus of diagnoses in Bulgarian annotated with ICD-10 codes is used for the classification task. Such an analysis gives a good idea of which of the models would be suitable for tasks of a similar type and domain. The experiments and evaluation results show that both approaches have comparable accuracy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Diagnosis; Encoding (symbols); Signal Encoding; Automatic Diagnosis; Classification Tasks; Clinical Documentation; Comparative Analyzes; Daily Tasks; Language Model; Learning Languages; Medical Classification; Medical Ontology; Medical Terminologies; Terminology","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Diagnosis; Encoding (symbols); Signal encoding; Automatic diagnosis; Classification tasks; Clinical documentation; Comparative analyzes; Daily tasks; Language model; Learning languages; Medical classification; Medical ontology; Medical terminologies; Terminology","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85123617023"

So far, the corpus contains 38,700 labeled data with a scale of more than 1,176,000 characters, which enriches the language resources in the field of ancient Chinese.

The methods that are typically applied (such as character- or token-based comparisons) are relatively simple, and therefore do not cap- ture the actual meaning of the texts. With the rise of transformer-based language models, text comparison based on meaning (rather than lexical features) is possible. In this paper, we model the ontology matching task as classification problem and present approaches based on transformer models. We further provide an easy to use implementation in the MELT framework which is suited for ontology and knowledge graph matching. We show that a transformer-based filter helps to choose the correct cor- respondences given a high-recall alignment and already achieves a good result with simple alignment post-processing methods.3 © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Matcher Optimization; Ontology Matching; Transformers; Knowledge Graph; Automated Matching; Knowledge Graphs; Matcher Optimization; Matchings; Ontology Matching; Optimisations; Simple++; Strong Signal; Textual Description; Transformer; Ontology","Knowledge graph; Automated matching; Knowledge graphs; Matcher optimization; Matchings; Ontology matching; Optimisations; Simple++; Strong signal; Textual description; Transformer; Ontology","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85122652126"

While Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Named Relation Recognition (NRR) on free-running text lack universally applicable solutions, under these constraints generalized template-matching can accomplish both. Interactive information extraction is demonstrated on three digitized books. The book-text tokens are first labeled according to their role (e.g. Head, Spouse, or Birthdate), then pairs of labeled entities are combined into labeled relations (e.g. &lt;Head [Spouse]&gt;, or &lt;Spouse [Birthdate]&gt;). Accurate NRR is ensured by high-precision (&gt;99%) NER. On semi-structured text the proposed NRR algorithm produces only valid relations from correctly labeled entities. About three hours of user interaction and a few minutes of laptop run time suffice to produce database- or ontology-ready input from a new book. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Information Extraction; Language Models; Text Analysis; Character Recognition; Natural Language Processing Systems; Template Matching; High-precision; Information Extraction; Language Model; Named Entity Recognition; Recognition Algorithm; Relation Extraction; Runtimes; Semi-structured Documents; Semi-structured Text; User Interaction; Information Retrieval","Character recognition; Natural language processing systems; Template matching; High-precision; Information extraction; Language model; Named entity recognition; Recognition algorithm; Relation extraction; Runtimes; Semi-structured documents; Semi-structured text; User interaction; Information retrieval","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85115309611"

However, constructing ontology manually requires a large amount of time and deep knowledge of the target field. Consequently, automating ontology generation from raw text corpus is required to meet the ontology demand. As an initial attempt of ontology generation with a neural network, a recurrent neural N = network (RNN)-based method is proposed. However, updating the architecture is possible because of the development in natural language processing (NLP). In contrast, the transfer learning of language models trained by a large unlabeled corpus such as bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) has yielded a breakthrough in NLP. Inspired by these achievements, to apply transfer learning of language models, we propose a novel workflow for ontology generation consisting of two-stage learning. This paper provides a quantitative comparison between the proposed method and the existing methods.

Language models pre-trained on large amounts of text corpora provide state-of-the-art performance against most standard natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks, including text classification. However, their prevalence over more traditional linear classifiers and domain-based approaches have not been investigated fully. In this paper, we address the combination of state-of-the-art deep learning and classification methods and provide an insight into what combination of methods fit the needs of small, domain-specific, and terminologicallyrich corpora. We focus on a real-world scenario related to a collection of safeguarding reports comprising learning experiences and reflections on tackling serious incidents involving children and vulnerable adults. Our aim is to automatically identify the main themes in a safeguarding report using three main types of classification. Our results show that for a very small amount of data a simple linear classifier outperforms state-of-the-art language models. Further, we show that the performance of classifiers is more affected by the size of the training data rather than the amount of context given. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Language Models; Small Domain Corpus; Text Classification; Benchmarking; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Information Retrieval Systems; Large Dataset; Ontology; Sentiment Analysis; Classification Methods; Learning Experiences; Linear Classifiers; Natural Language Processing; Performance Of Classifier; Real-world Scenario; State-of-the-art Performance; Text Classification; Classification (of Information)","Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Information retrieval systems; Large dataset; Ontology; Sentiment analysis; Classification methods; Learning experiences; Linear classifiers; NAtural language processing; Performance of classifier; Real-world scenario; State-of-the-art performance; Text classification; Classification (of information)","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85112074833"

We introduce a novel ontology-free framework that supports natural language queries for unseen constraints and slots in multi-domain task-oriented dialogs.

Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology, a fact that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents, where the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback, we propose a domain-aware dialogue state tracker, that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to predict for dynamic service schemas, including zero-shot domains. Unlike approaches that propose separate models for prediction of intents, requested slots, slot status, categorical slots and non-categorical slots, we propose a single model in an end-to-end architecture. The proposed model utilizes domain and slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations from a given dialogue, and then uses such representations to predict the values of the corresponding slot in a given domain. Integrating this mechanism with pretrained language models, our approach can effectively learn semantic relations and effectively perform transfer learning between domains or zero-shot tracking for domains not present in training. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Dialogue State Tracking; End-to-end; Multi-domain Dialogue Systems; Zero-shot Tracking; Forecasting; Semantics; Speech Processing; Transfer Learning; Conversational Agents; Dialogue Systems; Domain Ontologies; Dynamic Services; Language Model; Semantic Relations; Single Models; Task-oriented; Speech Recognition","Forecasting; Semantics; Speech processing; Transfer learning; Conversational agents; Dialogue systems; Domain ontologies; Dynamic services; Language model; Semantic relations; Single models; Task-oriented; Speech recognition","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100500450"

Currently, a lot of external research and collaboration between a modeling and simulation (M&S) expert and a domain expert is required to understand the specifics of domain structure and behavior to create a DSL. The Domain-Specific Scenario (DoSS) framework proposes the use of scenarios in natural language, which are currently used in requirements engineering and testing, as the basis for developing the domain model iteratively. In order to use natural-language scenarios to drive development, these scenarios need to be suitably broken down to extract information about the functionality of the language and domain model. A cited advantage of this approach is that it is a promising alternative for developing a DSL without excessive prior domain knowledge. A thorough analysis of this approach can assist in reaching a conclusion about the practicality and applicability of the proposed solution. In order to substantiate this claim, this paper presents a case study detailing the benefits obtained from using such an approach compared to the current standard in terms of two important metrics: a) time taken, and b) prior knowledge required. For this study, a student researcher was tasked with creating a metamodel for aviation using only the scenarios presented in the paper. They had no prior knowledge of flight training scenarios and had not seen an ontology or metamodel for it. The final metamodel is compared to the metamodel obtained by a researcher with previous domain modeling and aviation ontology modeling experience to see the value in the framework when used by someone who is not a domain or modeling and simulation expert. The resulting domain model was almost identical to that created by a domain expert, showing that the DoSS framework does not rely upon technical knowledge to generate domain models. A log of the time taken and effort required for this user also showed that the tasks were not considered tedious or taxing. The paper discusses the results and the challenges of the approach and the limitations of the results obtained. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Aviation; Digital Subscriber Lines; Domain Knowledge; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Domain Experts; Domain Model; Domain Specific; Domains Specific Languages; Language Model; Meta Model; Model And Simulation; Natural Languages; Prior-knowledge; Usability Analysis; Problem Oriented Languages","Aviation; Digital subscriber lines; Domain Knowledge; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Domain experts; Domain model; Domain specific; Domains specific languages; Language model; Meta model; Model and simulation; Natural languages; Prior-knowledge; Usability analysis; Problem oriented languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85100294229"

The field of computational linguistics is flourishing due to the intensive growth of dialogue agents; the most potential one is providing voice controlled smart personal assistant service for handsets and homes. The agents are usable, accessible but perform task-related short conversations. Non-goal-oriented dialogue agents are designed to imitate extended human–human conversations, also called as chit-chat, to provide the consumer with a satisfactory experience on the conversation quality. The design of such agents is primarily defined by a language model, unlike goal-oriented dialogue agents that employees slot based or ontology-based frameworks, hence most of the methods are data-driven. This paper surveys the current state of the art of non-goal-oriented dialogue systems specifically data-driven methods, the most prevalent being deep learning. This paper aims at (a) providing an insight of recent methods and architectures proposed for building context and modeling response along with a comprehensive review of the state of the art (b) examine the type of data set and evaluation methods available (c) present the challenges and limitation that the recent models, dataset and evaluation methods constitute. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Dialogue Agent; Dialogue Management Systems; Language Modeling; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Deep Learning; Ontology; Speech Processing; Data-driven Methods; Dialogue Systems; Evaluation Methods; Natural Languages; Ontology-based; Personal Assistants; State Of The Art; Voice-controlled; Computational Linguistics","Deep learning; Ontology; Speech processing; Data-driven methods; Dialogue systems; Evaluation methods; Natural languages; Ontology-based; Personal assistants; State of the art; Voice-controlled; Computational linguistics","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85086088700"

Given the recent advances in event-driven Information Extraction (IE), and that prior research on graph-to-text only focused on entity-driven KGs, this paper focuses on event-centric data. However, our data generation system can still be adapted to other types of KG data. Existing large-scale datasets in the graph-to-text area are non-parallel, meaning there is a large disconnect between the KGs and text. The datasets that have a paired KG and text, are small scale and manually generated or generated without a rich ontology, making the corresponding graphs sparse. Furthermore, these datasets contain many unlinked entities between their KG and text pairs. EventNarrative consists of approximately 230,000 graphs and their corresponding natural language text, six times larger than the current largest parallel dataset. It makes use of a rich ontology, all the KGs entities are linked to the text, and our manual annotations confirm a high data quality. Our aim is two-fold: to help break new ground in event-centric research where data is lacking and to give researchers a well-defined, large-scale dataset in order to better evaluate existing and future knowledge graph-to-text models. We also evaluate two types of baselines on EventNarrative: a graph-to-text specific model and two state-of-the-art language models, which previous work has shown to be adaptable to the knowledge graph-to-text domain. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Assimilation; Spatio-temporal Data; Data Generation System; Event-driven; Knowledge Graphs; Large Scale Events; Large-scale Datasets; Ontology's; Open World; Text Areas; Text Generations; World Knowledge; Knowledge Graph","Data assimilation; Spatio-temporal data; Data generation system; Event-driven; Knowledge graphs; Large scale events; Large-scale datasets; Ontology's; Open world; Text areas; Text generations; World knowledge; Knowledge graph","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000453796"

It has a better ability to organize, manage, and understand massive amounts of information, and can structure heterogeneous knowledge in the field. It can be widely used in medical, biological, financial, etc. In view of the current situation in the field of crop diseases and insect pests, there are multiple relationship pairs between the same entity and multiple entities, multi-source heterogeneous data, poor aggregation ability, low utilization, and the possibility of knowledge sharing. Combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text mining technologies, this study focused on data acquisition, ontology construction, knowledge extraction, and knowledge storage, researched on the construction of crops diseases and insect pests knowledge graph based on deep learning. Firstly, this study used the Scrapy crawler framework of the Python programming language to crawl data from web pages related to crop diseases and insect pests, and performed data cleaning and data supplementation through data preprocessing methods. Secondly, according to the characteristics of the domain corpus, the Protégé ontology construction tool was used to complete the semi-automatic construction of the crop diseases and insect pests ontology predefined the set of properties and relations and set the corresponding domains and ranges. Then, based on the ontology, the rule method was used to extract semi-structured knowledge, and the deep learning method was used to extract unstructured knowledge. In the process of unstructured knowledge extraction, a text annotation mode ""Main_Entity+Relation+BIESO"" (ME+R+BIESO) adapted to the domain corpus was also proposed. Based on a predefined set of relationships, entities and relationships were simultaneously annotated, it contained entity and relationship information at the same time, and directly modeling the triples instead of separately modeling entities and relationships. The corresponding triples were also directly obtained through analysis, which not only saved at least half of the cost of labeling but also realized the joint extraction of entity relations and solved the problem of overlapping relation extraction. And this study used the Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (BERT)- Bi-directional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM)+ Conditional Random Field (CRF) end-to-end model to experiment on the crop diseases and insect pests dataset. First, this study used the BERT pre-training language model to encode words, extracted text features, and used the generated vector as the input of the BiLSTM layer; BiLSTM integrated contextual information into the model at the same time, and performed bidirectional encoding to achieve effective prediction of label sequences; finally, this study used the CRF module to decode the output result of BiLSTM, and the label transition probability and constraint conditions were obtained through training and learning, and the entity label category of each character was obtained. The experimental results showed that the precision was 94.06%, the recall was 89.02%, and the F1 value reached 91.34%, which was much better than the pipeline method and classic models such as BiLSTM+CRF and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)+BiLSTM+CRF in the joint extraction method. The joint extraction of entity relations based on this annotation mode not only improved the efficiency and accuracy of annotation but also solved the problem of overlapping relations in the corpus. Finally, the extracted knowledge was stored in the graph database to realize the visual display of the knowledge graph and deep knowledge mining and reasoning. Combined the deep learning technology to realize the semi-automatic construction of the knowledge graph, which was of great significance for the detection of crop diseases and insect pests, forecasting and early warning, and the establishment of prevention models in the intelligent production system. It could provide a high-quality knowledge base for crop diseases and insect pests question answering systems, recommendation systems, search engines, and other applications, which could be effectively applied to crop variety selection, pest prevention and control, and fertilization and irrigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Crops; Deep Learning; Diseases And Pests; Joint Extraction Of Entity And Relation; Knowledge Graph; Models; Convolutional Neural Networks; Crops; Data Acquisition; Digital Storage; Disease Control; Encoding (symbols); Extraction; Graph Databases; Graphic Methods; Information Management; Knowledge Based Systems; Knowledge Representation; Learning Systems; Linguistics; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Problem Oriented Languages; Quality Control; Random Processes; Search Engines; Signal Encoding; Text Mining; Websites; Conditional Random Field; Domain-specific Knowledge; Forecasting And Early Warnings; Heterogeneous Knowledge; Natural Language Processing; Python Programming Language; Question Answering Systems; Transition Probabilities; Deep Learning","Convolutional neural networks; Crops; Data acquisition; Digital storage; Disease control; Encoding (symbols); Extraction; Graph Databases; Graphic methods; Information management; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Linguistics; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Problem oriented languages; Quality control; Random processes; Search engines; Signal encoding; Text mining; Websites; Conditional random field; Domain-specific knowledge; Forecasting and early warnings; Heterogeneous Knowledge; NAtural language processing; Python programming language; Question answering systems; Transition probabilities; Deep learning","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85102952395"

Determination of the functional characteristics of these proteins by experiments is an expensive endeavor that requires a lot of time. Furthermore, at the organismal level, such kind of experimental functional analyses can be conducted only for a very few selected model organisms. Computational function prediction methods can be used to fill this gap. The functions of proteins are classified by Gene Ontology (GO), which contains more than 40,000 classifications in three domains, Molecular Function (MF), Biological Process (BP), and Cellular Component (CC). Additionally, since proteins have many functions, function prediction represents a multi-label and multi-class problem. We developed a new method to predict protein function from sequence. To this end, natural language model was used to generate word embedding of sequence and learn features from it by deep learning, and additional features to locate every protein. Our method uses the dependencies between GO classes as background information to construct a deep learning model. We evaluate our method using the standards established by the Computational Assessment of Function Annotation (CAFA) and have noticeable improvement over several algorithms, such as FFPred, DeepGO, GoFDR and other methods compared on the CAFA3 datasets. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Convolution Neural Network; Natural Language Process; Protein Function Prediction; Protein-protein Interaction Network; Sequence Similarity Profile; Protein; Proteins; Deep Learning; Embeddings; Forecasting; Natural Language Processing Systems; Proteins; Background Information; Cellular Components; Computational Functions; Function Prediction; Functional Characteristics; Multi-class Problems; Natural Language Model; Protein Function Prediction; Learning Systems; Protein; Algorithm; Amino Acid Sequence; Chemistry; Protein Analysis; Protein Database; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Databases, Protein; Deep Learning; Protein Interaction Maps","Deep learning; Embeddings; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Proteins; Background information; Cellular components; Computational functions; Function prediction; Functional characteristics; Multi-class problems; Natural language model; Protein function prediction; Learning systems; protein; algorithm; amino acid sequence; chemistry; protein analysis; protein database; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Databases, Protein; Deep Learning; Protein Interaction Maps","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091774895"

Being able to process contextual knowledge from these Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) over time can help us understand manipulation intentions, which are essential for an intelligent robot to transition smoothly between various manipulation actions. In this paper, to model the intended concepts of manipulation, we present a vision dataset under a strictly constrained knowledge domain for both robot and human manipulations, where manipulation concepts and relations are stored by an ontology system in a taxonomic manner. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to generate a combination of visual attentions and an evolving knowledge graph filled with commonsense knowledge. Our scheme works with real-world camera streams and fuses an attention-based Vision-Language model with the ontology system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can successfully represent the evolution of an intended object manipulation procedure for both robots and humans. The proposed scheme allows the robot to mimic human-like intentional behaviors by watching real-time videos.

They enable search engines and recommendation systems to enhance user experience by discovering high-level abstraction of a search query and the user intent behind it. In this paper, we study the problem of query conceptualization, which is to find the most appropriate matching concepts for any given search query from a large pool of pre-defined concepts. We propose a coarse-to-fine approach to first reduce the search space for each query through a shortlisting scheme and then identify the matching concepts using pre-trained language models, which are meta-tuned to our query-concept matching task. Our shortlisting scheme involves using a GRU-based Relevant Words Generator (RWG) to first expand and complete the context of the given query and then shortlisting the candidate concepts through a scoring mechanism based on word overlaps. To accurately identify the most appropriate matching concepts for a query, even when the concepts may have zero verbatim overlaps with the query, we meta-fine-tune a BERT pairwise text-matching model under the Reptile meta-learning algorithm, which achieves zero-shot transfer learning on the conceptualization problem. Our two-stage framework can be trained with data completely derived from a search click graph, without requiring any human labelling efforts. For evaluation, we have constructed a large click graph based on more than $7$ million instances of the click history recorded in Tencent QQ browser and performed the query conceptualization task based on a large ontology with $159,148$ unique concepts. Results from a range of evaluation methods, including an offline evaluation procedure on the click graph, human evaluation, online A/B testing and case studies, have demonstrated the superiority of our approach over a number of competitive pre-trained language models and fine-tuned neural network baselines. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Conceptualization; Information Retrieval; Meta-learning; Query Analysis; Computational Linguistics; Data Mining; Graphic Methods; Query Processing; Search Engines; Transfer Learning; User Experience; Coarse To Fine; Evaluation Methods; High-level Abstraction; Human Evaluation; Human Labelling; Mechanism-based; Offline Evaluation; Search Queries; Learning Algorithms","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Graphic methods; Query processing; Search engines; Transfer learning; User experience; Coarse to fine; Evaluation methods; High-level abstraction; Human evaluation; Human labelling; Mechanism-based; Offline evaluation; Search queries; Learning algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85090410958"

The aspects of products provide a fine-grained meaningful perspective for understanding and organizing review texts. Traditional aspect term extraction approaches rely on discrete language models that treat words in isolation. Despite that continuous-space language models have demonstrated promise in addressing a wide range of problems, their application in aspect term extraction faces significant challenges. For instance, existing continuous-space language models typically require large collections of labeled data, which remain difficult to obtain in many domains. More importantly, previous methods are largely data driven but overlook the role of human knowledge in guiding model development. To address these limitations, this study designs and develops weakly supervised WordNet-guided deep learning to aspect term extraction. The approach draws on deep-level semantic information from WordNet to guide not only the selection representative seed terms but also the pruning of aspect candidate terms. The weak supervision is provided by a very small set of labeled data. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method using both direct and indirect methods. The evaluation results with Yelp restaurant reviews demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms all baseline methods including discrete models and the state-of-the-art continuous-space language models for aspect term extraction across both direct and indirect evaluations.

Materials and methods: Retrospective data on 2.1 million adult and pediatric ED visits was obtained from a large healthcare system covering the period of March 2013 to July 2019. A total of 355 497 (16.4%) visits from 65 737 (8.9%) patients were removed for absence of either a structured or unstructured chief complaint. To ensure adequate training set size, chief complaint labels that comprised less than 0.01%, or 1 in 10 000, of all visits were excluded. The cutoff threshold was incremented on a log scale to create seven datasets of decreasing sparsity. The classification task was to predict the provider-assigned label from the free-text chief complaint using BERT, with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) as baselines. Performance was measured as the Top-k accuracy from k ¼ 1:5 on a hold-out test set comprising 5% of the samples. The embedding for each free-text chief complaint was extracted as the final 768-dimensional layer of the BERT model and visualized using t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). Results: The models achieved increasing performance with datasets of decreasing sparsity, with BERT outperforming both LSTM and ELMo. The BERT model yielded Top-1 accuracies of 0.65 and 0.69, Top-3 accuracies of 0.87 and 0.90, and Top-5 accuracies of 0.92 and 0.94 on datasets comprised of 434 and 188 labels, respectively. Visualization using t-SNE mapped the learned embeddings in a clinically meaningful way, with related concepts embedded close to each other and broader types of chief complaints clustered together. Discussion: Despite the inherent noise in the chief complaint label space, the model was able to learn a rich representation of chief complaints and generate reasonable predictions of their labels.

While there is a rapid growth in knowledge bases, it poses a challenge of retrieving information from them. Knowledge Base Question Answering is one of the promising approaches for extracting substantial knowledge from Knowledge Bases. Unlike web search, Question Answering over a knowledge base gives accurate and concise results, provided that natural language questions can be understood and mapped precisely to an answer in the knowledge base. However, some of the existing embedding-based methods for knowledge base question answering systems ignore the subtle correlation between the question and the Knowledge Base (e.g., entity types, relation paths, and context) and suffer from the Out Of Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we focused on using a pre-trained language model for the Knowledge Base Question Answering task. Firstly, we used Bert base uncased for the initial experiments. We further fine-tuned these embeddings with a twoway attention mechanism from the knowledge base to the asked question and from the asked question to the knowledge base answer aspects. Our method is based on a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture with a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to represent the asked question dynamically in multiple aspects. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the Bert pre-trained language model embeddings for question answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known embedding methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bert; Kbqa; Knowledge Base Question Answering; Language Model; Multi-head Attention; Computational Linguistics; Convolutional Neural Networks; Embeddings; Information Retrieval; Natural Language Processing Systems; Network Architecture; Attention Mechanisms; Conventional Computers; Embedding Method; Natural Language Questions; Procedural Codes; Question Answering; Question Answering Systems; Question Answering Task; Knowledge Based Systems","Computational linguistics; Convolutional neural networks; Embeddings; Information retrieval; Natural language processing systems; Network architecture; Attention mechanisms; Conventional computers; Embedding method; Natural language questions; Procedural codes; Question Answering; Question answering systems; Question Answering Task; Knowledge based systems","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85093833070"

This type of semantic relations is often used to describe the subordination relation between two semantic concepts, such as ""(dog, animal)"", ""(rose, plant)"" and ""(sofa, furniture)"". The accurate extraction and prediction of hypernymy relations from massive text corpora is extremely important for mining the inherent hierarchy among semantic concepts and entities, as well as building large-scale semantic networks, ontologies, knowledge graphs and other knowledge-intensive information systems. This task is also beneficial to a variety of downstream NLP tasks, including natural language inference, personalized recommendation, query understanding and so on. Most traditional hypernymy prediction algorithms rely on relatively fixed language patterns, such as the Hearst patterns in English. These approaches have several potential drawbacks such as the low coverage of relations in texts and the high degree of manual intervention required to train these machine learning models. In addition, the textual patterns used for hypernymy extraction are highly correlated with the characteristics of the target language itself. For languages with low regularity in text expressions such as Chinese, pattern-based methods are not sufficiently accurate. Distributional models for hypernymy prediction are more precise and can avoid the occurrence sparsity problem of concepts, but likely to suffer from the ""lexical memorization"" problem. With the rapid development of deep learning techniques in NLP, word embeddings which learned from neural language models are frequently employed to model the semantic relations between words, without a lot of linguistic knowledge. Especially, word embedding projection models learn how to map the embeddings of hyponyms to those of their hypernyms, modeling the representations of hypernymy relations in the embedding space explicitly. In view of existing classical and latest research, this paper introduces the development process and the latest breakthrough of word embedding projection models, in order to predict hypernymy relations accurately. We give a unified mathematical framework of these models and discuss how these models are developed, including the improvements of projection learning based on deep iterative, transductive and adversarial learning. Specifically, iterative learning methods consider the situation where hypernymy relations from different domains have diverse representations, and employ iterative, semi-supervised learning technique to learn multiple projection matrices from the embeddings of hyponyms to hypernyms. Transductive models learn the projection matrices of hypernymy and non-hypernymy relations at the same time, and consider the semantic differences between concepts in the training and testing sets. Because there are a large number of hypernymy relations in modern taxonomies, deep adversarial models learn neural network-based projection models over taxonomies and training sets, and train adversarial classifiers to make the two neural networks to learn from each other. In the experiments, we evaluate all these projection learning models under a unified framework, including multiple general-domain and domain-specific benchmark datasets in English and Chinese languages. We also compare the advantages and disadvantages of these projection learning models under different learning circumstances. Finally, the future research directions of this work are discussed, which focus on domain-specific and long-tail hypernymy prediction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chinese Language Characteristics; Hypernymy Relation; Relation Extraction; Word Embedding; Word Embedding Projection Model; Computational Linguistics; Deep Learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Forecasting; Iterative Methods; Knowledge Representation; Large Scale Systems; Natural Language Processing Systems; Neural Networks; Semantics; Semi-supervised Learning; Taxonomies; Text Mining; Distributional Models; Future Research Directions; Machine Learning Models; Mathematical Frameworks; Natural Language Processing; Personalized Recommendation; Prediction Algorithms; Semi-supervised Learning Techniques; Learning Systems","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Embeddings; Extraction; Forecasting; Iterative methods; Knowledge representation; Large scale systems; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Semantics; Semi-supervised learning; Taxonomies; Text mining; Distributional models; Future research directions; Machine learning models; Mathematical frameworks; NAtural language processing; Personalized recommendation; Prediction algorithms; Semi-supervised learning techniques; Learning systems","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85089896380"

Most state-of-The-Art approaches for protein classification are tailored to single classification tasks and rely on handcrafted features, such as position-specific-scoring matrices from expensive database searches. We argue that this level of performance can be reached or even be surpassed by learning a task-Agnostic representation once, using self-supervised language modeling, and transferring it to specific tasks by a simple fine-Tuning step. Results: We put forward a universal deep sequence model that is pre-Trained on unlabeled protein sequences from Swiss-Prot and fine-Tuned on protein classification tasks. We apply it to three prototypical tasks, namely enzyme class prediction, gene ontology prediction and remote homology and fold detection. The proposed method performs on par with state-of-The-Art algorithms that were tailored to these specific tasks or, for two out of three tasks, even outperforms them. These results stress the possibility of inferring protein properties from the sequence alone and, on more general grounds, the prospects of modern natural language processing methods in omics. Moreover, we illustrate the prospects for explainable machine learning methods in this field by selected case studies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Protein; Proteins; Protein; Algorithm; Amino Acid Sequence; Genetics; Protein Database; Software; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Databases, Protein; Proteins; Software","protein; algorithm; amino acid sequence; genetics; protein database; software; Algorithms; Amino Acid Sequence; Databases, Protein; Proteins; Software","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084028155"

At the same time, unambiguous words make for a large portion of all words in WordNet, while being poorly covered in existing sense-annotated corpora.

However, distributional semantics, derived from neural language models is less competitive in computing semantic relatedness or similarity than other taxonomy-based methods. Although current researches seek to exploit the handcrafted semantic knowledge in ontology to improve distributional semantics, they often ignore distinguishing different functions of semantic relationships in updating or retrofitting neural word embeddings. This paper proposes retrofitting neural word embedding through semantic relationships encoded in semantic networks such as WordNet and Roget's thesaurus. We employ the hypernym/hyponym relationships to modify the asymmetric distance measure in retrofitting neural embeddings, which can fully transfer the hierarchical semantic information contained in semantic networks.

The completeness and correctness of the input data affect the results of the compliance checking. Refinement operations on data represented through knowledge graphs can help the assessment of these data properties. In this work, a model to represent rules holding complex constraints is proposed and conveyed through an ontology. This model aims to overcome existing expressiveness limitations and to provide a conceptual tool to represent both compliance regulations and domain experts' knowledge encoded through heuristics. These heuristics are used to drive the refinement process needed prior the compliance checking. The proposed model is intended as the first step towards an automatic execution process of both types of rule instances. The model has been assessed by representing regulations issued by Swiss entities and domain experts' heuristics targeting data of an area of the city of Geneva. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Digital Storage; Intelligent Computing; Knowledge Acquisition; Knowledge Representation; Architecture , Engineering , And Constructions; Complex Constraints; Compliance Checking; Compliance Regulations; Execution Process; Refinement Operations; Refinement Process; Regulation Compliance; Compliance Control","Digital storage; Intelligent computing; Knowledge acquisition; Knowledge representation; Architecture , engineering , and constructions; Complex constraints; Compliance checking; Compliance regulations; Execution process; Refinement operations; Refinement process; Regulation compliance; Compliance control","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091041936"

Many healthcare centers and hospitals use reporting systems where medical practitioners write a preliminary medical report and the report is later reviewed, revised, and finalized by a more experienced physician. The revisions range from stylistic to corrections of critical errors or misinterpretations of the case. Due to the large quantity of reports written daily, it is often difficult to manually and thoroughly review all the finalized reports to find such errors and learn from them. To address this challenge, we propose a novel ranking approach, consisting of textual and ontological overlaps between the preliminary and final versions of reports. The approach learns to rank the reports based on the degree of discrepancy between the versions. This allows medical practitioners to easily identify and learn from the reports in which their interpretation most substantially differed from that of the attending physician (who finalized the report). This is a crucial step towards uncovering potential errors and helping medical practitioners to learn from such errors, thus improving patient-care in the long run. We evaluate our model on a dataset of radiology reports and show that our approach outperforms both previously-proposed approaches and more recent language models by 4.5% to 15.4%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science; Computers; Health Concerns; Language Model; Medical Errors; Medical Practitioner; Potential Errors; Radiology Reports; Ranking Approach; Reporting Systems; Errors","Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Health concerns; Language model; Medical errors; Medical practitioner; Potential errors; Radiology reports; Ranking approach; Reporting systems; Errors","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85084187747"

As a result, a simple Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) method using our representations is able to consistently surpass the performance of previous systems using powerful neural sequencing models.

Since words that share semantics are expected to be clustered together, it is common to use a feature vector representation generated from a distributional theory-based word embedding method. The goal of this work is to utilize Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for better clustering performance of the low-resource Iraqi vocabulary. We began with a new Dialect Fast Stemming Algorithm (DFSA) that utilizes the MSA data. The proposed algorithm achieved 0.85 accuracy measured by the F1 score. Then, the distributional theory-based word embedding method and a new simple, yet effective, feature vector named Wasf-Vec word embedding are tested. Wasf-Vec word representation utilizes a word’s topology features. The difference between Wasf-Vec and distributional theory-based word embedding is that Wasf-Vec captures relations that are not contextually based. The embedding is followed by an analysis of how the dialect words are clustered within other MSA words. The analysis is based on the word semantic relations that are well supported by solid linguistic theories to shed light on the strong and weak word relation representations identified by each embedding method. The analysis is handled by visualizing the feature vector in two-dimensional (2D) space. The feature vectors of the distributional theory-based word embedding method are plotted in 2D space using the t-sne algorithm, while the Wasf-Vec feature vectors are plotted directly in 2D space. A word’s nearest neighbors and the distance-histograms of the plotted words are examined. For validation purpose of the word classification used in this article, the produced classes are employed in Class-based Language Modeling (CBLM). Wasf-Vec CBLM achieved a 7% lower perplexity (pp) than the distributional theory-based word embedding method CBLM. This result is significant when working with low-resource languages. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","2d Visualizing; Arabic Language; Class-based Language Modeling; Dialect; Morphology; Orthographic; Phonology; Topology; Word Embedding; Words Classification; Words Features; Words Ontology; Classification (of Information); Computational Linguistics; Modeling Languages; Morphology; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Topology; Vector Spaces; Vectors; 2d Visualizing; Arabic Languages; Class-based Language Model; Dialect; Orthographic; Phonology; Word Embedding; Words Features; Embeddings","Classification (of information); Computational linguistics; Modeling languages; Morphology; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; Topology; Vector spaces; Vectors; 2D visualizing; Arabic languages; Class-based language model; Dialect; Orthographic; Phonology; Word embedding; Words features; Embeddings","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85077799973"

Objective: We aimed at building an algorithm for assessing semantic similarity of pairs of primary and reported outcomes.We focused on approaches that do not require manually curated domain-specific resources such as ontologies and thesauri. Methods: We tested several approaches, including single measures of similarity (based on strings, stems and lemmas, paths and distances in an ontology, and vector representations of phrases), classifiers using a combination of single measures as features, and a deep learning approach that consists in fine-tuning pre-trained deep language representations.We tested language models provided by BERT (trained on general-domain texts), BioBERT and SciBERT (trained on biomedical and scientific texts, respectively).We explored the possibility of improving the results by taking into account the variants for referring to an outcome (e.g.the use of a measurement tool name instead on the outcome name; the use of abbreviations).We release an open corpus with annotation for similarity of pairs of outcomes. Results: Classifiers using a combination of single measures as features outperformed the single measures, while deep learning algorithms using BioBERT and SciBERT models outperformed the classifiers.BioBERT reached the best F-measure of 89.75%.The addition of variants of outcomes did not improve the results for the best-performing single measures nor for the classifiers, but it improved the performance of deep learning algorithms: BioBERT achieved an F-measure of93.38%. Conclusions: Deep learning approaches using pre-trained language representations outperformed other approaches for similarity assessment of trial outcomes, without relying on any manually curated domain-specific resources (ontologies and other lexical resources). Addition of variants of outcomes further improved the performance of deep learning algorithms. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Pre-trained Language Representations; Semantic Similarity; Spin Detection; Trial Outcomes; Deep Learning; Medical Applications; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Semantics; Natural Language Processing; Pre-trained Language Representations; Semantic Similarity; Spin Detection; Trial Outcomes; Learning Algorithms; Algorithm; Article; Classifier; Clinical Assessment; Deep Learning; Human; Human Experiment; Natural Language Processing; Ontology","Deep learning; Medical applications; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Semantics; NAtural language processing; Pre-trained language representations; Semantic similarity; Spin detection; Trial outcomes; Learning algorithms; algorithm; article; classifier; clinical assessment; deep learning; human; human experiment; natural language processing; ontology","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Final Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85074260516"

To alleviate this problem, query expansion processes are applied in order to spawn and integrate additional terms to an initial query. This requires accurate identification of main query concepts to ensure the intended search goal is duly emphasized and relevant expansion concepts are extracted and included in the enriched query. Natural language queries have intrinsic linguistic properties such as parts-of-speech labels and grammatical relations which can be utilized in determining the intended search goal. Additionally, extrinsic language-based resources such as ontologies are needed to suggest expansion concepts semantically coherent with the query content. We present here a query expansion framework which capitalizes on both linguistic characteristics of user queries and ontology resources for query constituent encoding, expansion concept extraction and concept weighting.

A report by Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) shows that 80% of the patients suffering from Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) have suicidal behavior, 5-10% of whom commit suicide. While multiple initiatives have been developed and implemented for suicide prevention, a key challenge has been the social stigma associated with mental disorders, which deters patients from seeking help or sharing their experiences directly with others including clinicians. This is particularly true for teenagers and younger adults where suicide is the second highest cause of death in the US. Prior research involving surveys and questionnaires (e.g. PHQ-9) for suicide risk prediction failed to provide a quantitative assessment of risk that informed timely clinical decision-making for intervention. Our interdisciplinary study concerns the use of Reddit as an unobtrusive data source for gleaning information about suicidal tendencies and other related mental health conditions afflicting depressed users. We provide details of our learning framework that incorporates domain-specific knowledge to predict the severity of suicide risk for an individual. Our approach involves developing a suicide risk severity lexicon using medical knowledge bases and suicide ontology to detect cues relevant to suicidal thoughts and actions. We also use language modeling, medical entity recognition and normalization and negation detection to create a dataset of 2181 redditors that have discussed or implied suicidal ideation, behavior, or attempt. Given the importance of clinical knowledge, our gold standard dataset of 500 redditors (out of 2181) was developed by four practicing psychiatrists following the guidelines outlined in Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), with the pairwise annotator agreement of 0.79 and group-wise agreement of 0.73. Compared to the existing four-label classification scheme (no risk, low risk, moderate risk, and high risk), our proposed C-SSRS-based 5-label classification scheme distinguishes people who are supportive, from those who show different severity of suicidal tendency. Our 5-label classification scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art schemes by improving the graded recall by 4.2% and reducing the perceived risk measure by 12.5%. Convolutional neural network (CNN) provided the best performance in our scheme due to the discriminative features and use of domain-specific knowledge resources, in comparison to SVM-L that has been used in the state-of-the-art tools over similar dataset. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Behavioral Research; Clinical Research; Decision Making; Health Care; Health Risks; Modeling Languages; Natural Language Processing Systems; Neural Networks; Surveys; World Wide Web; Clinical Decision Making; Convolutional Neural Network; Discriminative Features; Domain-specific Knowledge; Inter-disciplinary Studies; Mental Health Services; Quantitative Assessments; State-of-the-art Scheme; Risk Assessment","Behavioral research; Clinical research; Decision making; Health care; Health risks; Modeling languages; Natural language processing systems; Neural networks; Surveys; World Wide Web; Clinical decision making; Convolutional neural network; Discriminative features; Domain-specific knowledge; Inter-disciplinary studies; Mental health services; Quantitative assessments; State-of-the-art scheme; Risk assessment","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066888757"

This study is motivated by the previously established observation that inflectional morphemes can be just as variable as derivational ones. For instance, the English plural “-s” can turn the fabric silk into the garments of a jockey, silks. While humans know that silk in this sense has no plural, it takes more for machines to arrive at this conclusion. Frequently utilized computational language resources, such as WordNet, or models for representing computational lexicons, like OntoLex-Lemon, have no descriptive mechanism to represent such inflectional semantic shifts. To investigate this phenomenon, we extract word pairs of different grammatical number from WordNet that feature additional senses in the plural and evaluate their distribution in vector space, i.e., pre-trained word2vec and fastText embeddings. We then propose an extension of OntoLex-Lemon to accommodate this phenomenon that we call inflectional morpho-semantic variation to provide a formal representation accessible to algorithms, neural networks, and agents. While the exact scope of the problem is yet to be determined, this first dataset shows that it is not negligible. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Embeddings; Formal Lexical Modeling; Inflectional Morphology; Semantic Shift; Citrus Fruits; Embeddings; Morphology; Ontology; Semantics; Silk; Vector Spaces; Computational Languages; Formal Representations; Inflectional Morphemes; Know-that; Language Model; Word-pairs; Wordnet; Modeling Languages","Citrus fruits; Embeddings; Morphology; Ontology; Semantics; Silk; Vector spaces; Computational languages; Formal representations; Inflectional morphemes; Know-that; Language model; Word-pairs; Wordnet; Modeling languages","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85068066655"

Requirements in the form of plain text are converted to instances of OWL ontologies for analysis. There are three basic elements “subject”, “action” and “object” in the requirements. These elements become classes of the ontology. The object properties between instances of the same classes are defined in the ontology. In the system of rules it is determined that one of four types of relations can be established between a pair of the requirements: isConflict, isDuplicate, isInterconnect, isNotInterconnect. We develop the software product in the Python language for building and applying production rules system for classes and property objects of the ontology.

The vector model is implemented using a neural network based on the TensorFlow framework. The peculiarity of the method is the use of the baseline pre-trained Wor2Vec model based on texts from the English Wikipedia and Google News, which is consistently extended on the basis of relationships specific to the ontologies being matched.

A key for successful information extraction is to consider such resources as evolving artifacts and keep them up-to-date. In this paper, we tackle the problem of dictionary expansion and we propose a human-in-the-loop approach: we couple neural language models with tight human supervision to assist the user in building and maintaining domain-specific dictionaries. The approach works on any given input text corpus and is based on the explore and exploit paradigm: starting from a few seeds (or an existing dictionary) it effectively discovers new instances (explore) from the text corpus as well as predicts new potential instances which are not in the corpus, i.e. “unseen”, using the current dictionary entries (exploit). We evaluate our approach on five real-world dictionaries, achieving high accuracy with a rapid expansion rate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Data Mining; Expansion; Information Retrieval; Domain Specific; Extract Informations; Human Supervision; Human-in-the-loop; Knowledge Extraction; Lexical Resources; Semantic Resources; Unstructured Texts; Semantic Web","Data mining; Expansion; Information retrieval; Domain specific; Extract informations; Human supervision; Human-in-the-loop; Knowledge extraction; Lexical resources; Semantic resources; Unstructured texts; Semantic Web","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85066815840"

When clustering documents this is achieved by converting the corpus into a numeric format and applying clustering techniques to this new format. Values are assigned to terms based on their frequency within a particular document, against their general occurrence in the corpus. One obstacle in achieving this aim is as a result of the polysemic nature of terms. That is words having multiple meanings; each intended meaning only being discernible when examining the context in which they are used. Thus, disambiguating the intended meaning of a term can greatly improve the efficacy of a clustering algorithm. One approach to achieve this end has been done through the creation of an ontology - Wordnet, which can act as a look-up as to the intended meaning of a term. Wordnet however, is a static source and does not keep pace with the changing nature of language. The aim of this paper is to show that while Wordnet can be affective, however it is static in nature and thus does not capture some contemporary usage of terms. Particularly when the dataset is taken from online conversation forums, who would not be structured in a standard document format. Our proposed solution involves using Reddit as a contemporary source which moves with new trends in word usage. To better illustrate this point we cluster comments found in online threads such as Reddit and compare the efficacy of different representations of these document sets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Data Mining; Document Clustering; Graph Theory; Word Sense Disambiguation; Wordnet; Classification (of Information); Cluster Analysis; Data Mining; Graph Theory; Information Retrieval Systems; Knowledge Engineering; Knowledge Management; Natural Language Processing Systems; Ontology; Clustering Documents; Clustering Techniques; Document Clustering; Document Representation; Standard Documents; Static Sources; Word Sense Disambiguation; Wordnet; Clustering Algorithms","Classification (of information); Cluster analysis; Data mining; Graph theory; Information retrieval systems; Knowledge engineering; Knowledge management; Natural language processing systems; Ontology; Clustering documents; Clustering techniques; Document Clustering; Document Representation; Standard documents; Static sources; Word Sense Disambiguation; Wordnet; Clustering algorithms","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85064010888"

There are three types of heterogeneities, i.e., different structures representing entities, different predicates with the same meaning and different literal formats used in objects. Approaches based on ontology mapping or Information Retrieval (IR) cannot deal with all types of heterogeneities. Facing these limitations, we propose a hierarchical multi-hop language model (HMPM). It discriminates among three types of predicates, descriptive predicates, out-associated predicates and in-associated predicates, and generates multi-hop models for them respectively. All predicates’ similarities between the query and entity are organized into a hierarchy, with predicate types on the first level and predicates of this type on the second level. All candidates are ranked in ascending order. We evaluated HMPM in three datasets, DBpedia, LinkedMDB and Yago. The results of experiments show that the effectiveness and generality of HMPM outperform the existing approaches. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","A; Hierarchical Multi-hop Ranking Model (hmpm); Language Model; Linked Data; Tp 391; Computational Linguistics; Data Handling; Different Structure; Heterogeneous Datasets; Language Model; Linked- Mdb; Ontology Mapping; Ranking Model; Second Level; Tp 391; Linked Data","Computational linguistics; Data handling; Different structure; Heterogeneous datasets; Language model; Linked- mdb; Ontology mapping; Ranking model; Second level; TP 391; Linked data","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85051454048"

This study proposes a better approach, which does not require in-depth knowledge of the linguistic properties of the languages, but it produces a good quality translation. This study evaluated 28 different parameters in IRSTLM language modeling, which resulting 270 millions experiments, and proposes a sequence evaluation mechanism based on a maximum evaluation of each parameter in producing a good quality translation based on NIST and BLEU. The parallel corpus and statistical machine learning for English and Bahasa Indonesia were used in this study. The pruning process, user interface, and the personalization of translation have a very important role in implementing of this machine translation. The result is quite promising. It shows that pruning process increases of the translation process time. The particular sequence knowledge/value parameter in translation process has a better performance than the other method using in-depth linguistic knowledge approaches.

Currently, an open challenge in building large-scale knowledge graphs from structured data available on the Web (HTML tables, CSVs, JSONs) is the semantic integration of heterogeneous data sources. In fact, such diverse and scattered information rarely provide a formal description of metadata that is required to accomplish the integration task. In this paper we propose an approach based on neural networks to reconstruct the semantics of data sources to produce high quality knowledge graphs in terms of semantic accuracy.

The requirements around this project are: to be able to describe languages of different typeS while respecting their grammatical tradition, and to be able to serve two main use cases that define our typical work, namely, the labelling of linguistic information in lexicographic products, and the provision of support for language processing tools and corpus annotation processes. These requirements determined the conception and design of COMO, created as a reference model within a broader data architecture in order to address issues of syntactic and semantic interoperability.

Classifying this content accurately can be a challenging task due to the fact that comments are typically short in nature and on their own may lack context. Reddita is a very popular microblogging site whose popularity has seen a huge and consistent increase over the years. In this paper we propose using alternative but related Reddit threads to build language models that can be used to disambiguate intend mean of terms in a post. A related thread is one which is similar in content, often consisting of the same frequently occurring terms or phrases. We posit that threads of a similar nature use similar language and that the identification of related threads can be used as a source to add context to a post, enabling more accurate classification. In this paper, graphs are used to model the frequency and co-occurrence of terms. The terms of a document are mapped to nodes, and the co-occurrence of two terms are recorded as edge weights. To show the robustness of our approach, we compare the performance in using related Reddit threads to the use of an external ontology; Wordnet. We apply a number of evaluation metrics to the clusters created and show that in every instance, the use of alternative threads to improve document representations is better than the use of Wordnet or standard augmented vector models. We apply this approach to increasingly harder environments to test the robustness of our approach. A tougher environment is one where the classifying algorithm has more than two categories to choose from when selecting the appropriate class. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification Methods; Clustering; Context Discovery; Mining Text; Semi-structured Data; Knowledge Engineering; Ontology; Text Processing; Classification Methods; Clustering; Co-occurrence; Context Discovery; Document Representation; Evaluation Metrics; Language Model; Semi Structured Data; Knowledge Management","Knowledge engineering; Ontology; Text processing; Classification methods; Clustering; Co-occurrence; Context discovery; Document Representation; Evaluation metrics; Language model; Semi structured data; Knowledge management","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85059040428"

Atomic discrete representations of words make it difficult to represent semantically related sentences. Other sentence components such as phrases and named-entities should be recognized and given representations as units instead of individual words. Different entity senses should be assigned different representations even though they share identical words. In this paper, we focus on building the vector representations (embedding) of named-entities from their contexts to facilitate the task of ontology population where named-entities need to be recognized and disambiguated in natural language text. Given a list of target named-entities, Wikidata is used to compensate for the lack of a labeled corpus to build the contexts of all target named-entities as well as all their senses. Description text and semantic relations with other named-entities are considered when building the contexts from Wikidata. To avoid noisy and uninformative features in the embedding generated from artificially built contexts, we propose a method to build compact entity representations to sharpen entity embedding by removing irrelevant features and emphasizing the most detailed ones. An extended version of the Continuous Bag-of-Words model (CBOW) is used to build the joint vector representations of words and named-entities using Wikidata contexts. Each entity context is then represented by a subset of elements that maximizes the chances of keeping the most descriptive features about the target entity. The final entity representations are built by compressing the embedding of the chosen subset using a deep stacked auto encoders model. Cosine similarity and t-SNE visualization technique are used to evaluate the final entity vectors. Results show that semantically related entities are clustered near each other in the vector space. Entities that appear in similar contexts are assigned similar compact vector representations based on their contexts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Entity Embeddings; Entity Vector Representations; Named Entity Disambiguation","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85055353372"

However, as new content arrives keeping dictionaries up-to-date is a crucial operation. In this paper, we propose a human-in-the-loop (HumL) dictionary expansion approach that employs a lightweight neural language model coupled with tight HumL supervision to assist the user in building and maintaining a domain-specific dictionary from an input text corpus. The approach is based on the explore/exploit paradigm to effectively discover new instances (explore) from the text corpus as well as predict new “unseen” terms not currently in the corpus using the accepted dictionary entries (exploit). We evaluate our approach on a real-world scenario in the healthcare domain, in which we construct a dictionary of adverse drug reactions from user blogs as input text corpus. The evaluation shows that using our approach the user can easily extend the input dictionary, where tight human-in-the-loop integration results in a 216% improvement in effectiveness. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Adverse Drug Reactions; Domain Specific; Foundational Elements; Healthcare Domains; Human-in-the-loop; Language Model; Real-world Scenario; Unstructured Texts; Computational Linguistics","Adverse drug reactions; Domain specific; Foundational elements; Healthcare domains; Human-in-the-loop; Language model; Real-world scenario; Unstructured texts; Computational linguistics","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85052838549"
