While value-based analyses are crucial, we argue that ontologies—concerning what we allow ourselves to think or talk about—is a vital but under-recognized dimension in analyzing these systems. Proposing a need for a practice-based engagement with ontologies, we offer four orientations for considering ontologies in design: pluralism, groundedness, liveliness, and enactment. We share examples of potentialities that are opened up through these orientations across the entire LLM development pipeline by conducting two ontological analyses: examining the responses of four LLM-based chatbots in a prompting exercise, and analyzing the architecture of an LLM-based agent simulation. We conclude by sharing opportunities and limitations of working with ontologies in the design and development of sociotechnical systems.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:51","2025-09-10 14:11:51","","","","","","","","","CHI '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","large language models; ontologies; generative AI; foundation models; LLM agents; ontological design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, training on large-scale corpora often fails to effectively organize domain knowledge of LLMs, leading to fragmented understanding. Inspired by how humans connect concepts and organize knowledge through mind maps, we aim to emulate this approach by using ontology with hierarchical conceptual knowledge to reorganize LLM's domain knowledge. From this perspective, we propose an ontology-driven self-training framework called OntoTune, which aims to align LLMs with ontology through in-context learning, enabling the generation of responses guided by the ontology. We leverage in-context learning to identify whether the LLM has acquired the specific concept's ontology knowledge, and select the entries not yet mastered by LLM as the training set to further align the LLM with ontology. Compared to existing domain LLMs based on newly collected large-scale domain-specific corpora, our OntoTune, which relies on the existing, long-term developed ontology and LLM itself, significantly reduces data maintenance costs and offers improved generalization ability. We conduct our study in the medical domain to evaluate the effectiveness of OntoTune, utilizing a standardized medical ontology, SNOMED CT as our ontology source. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoTune achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-ontology task hypernym discovery and out-of-ontology task medical domain QA. Moreover, compared to the latest direct ontology injection method TaxoLLaMA, our OntoTune better preserves original knowledge of LLM.

Furthermore, differences in platform-specific workflow specifications cause inefficiencies when porting workflows between platforms, even if the different platforms handle semantically the same workflow.In this paper, we propose a bottom-up approach for developing a platform-independent software-intensive workflow modeling language.

Based on the approach, we develop a platform-independent Workflow Modeling Language (WorkflowML) that covers four famous workflow engines (Airflow, Kubeflow, Argo workflow, and Metaflow). Furthermore, we implement an open-source visual programming tool for WorkflowML using the ADOxx metamodeling platform. We validate our approach by evaluating the expressiveness of WorkflowML based on modeling case studies of 42 simple workflows and two real-case workflow-based services.

FET has been studied extensively in natural language processing and typically relies on human-annotated corpora for training, which is costly and difficult to scale. Recent studies explore the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as a knowledge base to generate rich and context-aware weak supervision for FET. However, a PLM still requires direction and guidance to serve as a knowledge base as they often generate a mixture of rough and fine-grained types, or tokens unsuitable for typing. In this study, we vision that an ontology provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, which will help select the best results generated by multiple PLM models and head words. Specifically, we propose a novel annotation-free, ontology-guided FET method, OntoType, which follows a type ontological structure, from coarse to fine, ensembles multiple PLM prompting results to generate a set of type candidates, and refines its type resolution, under the local context with a natural language inference model. Our experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and NYT datasets using their associated ontological structures demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art zero-shot fine-grained entity typing methods as well as a typical LLM method, ChatGPT.

Although a variety of machine-learning approaches have been proposed that can simplify this task by learning the patterns from experts, such techniques are still susceptible to domain knowledge updates that could potentially change the patterns and lead to extra expert involvement. The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) has demonstrated a general cognitive ability, which has the potential to assist ontology alignment from the cognition level, thus obviating the need for costly expert involvement. However, the process by which the output of LLMs is generated can be opaque and thus the reliability and interpretability of such models is not always predictable. This paper proposes a dialogue model, in which multiple agents negotiate the correspondence between two knowledge sets with the support from an LLM.

They allow the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to automatic execution, interpretation, and analysis. However, the arguably most humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language, which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into simulation models. Existing studies only explored using very large LLMs, like the commercial GPT models, without fine-tuning model weights. To close this gap, we show how an open-weights, 7B-parameter Mistral model can be fine-tuned to translate natural language descriptions to reaction network models in a domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation model in up to (84.5% ) of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study demonstrates the model’s practical potential for one-time generation as well as interactive modeling in various domains. While promising, in its current form, the fine-tuned small LLM cannot catch up with large LLMs. We conclude that higher-quality training data are required, and expect future small and open-source LLMs to offer new opportunities.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:11:52","2025-09-10 14:11:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","natural language processing; knowledge extraction; language model; constrained decoding; simulation model generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most recent advances in the field of OA rely on the widely proven effectiveness of pre-trained language models to represent the human-generated language that describes the entities in an ontology.

It typically involves evaluating the interactions between users and forms. Automated test-case generation remains a challenge for web-form testing: Due to the complex, multi-level structure of web pages, it can be difficult to automatically capture their inherent contextual information for inclusion in the tests. Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential for contextual text generation. This motivated us to explore how they could generate automated tests for web forms, making use of the contextual information within form elements. To the best of our knowledge, no comparative study examining different LLMs has yet been reported for web-form-test generation. To address this gap in the literature, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study investigating the effectiveness of 11 LLMs on 146 web forms from 30 open-source Java web applications. In addition, we propose three HTML-structure-pruning methods to extract key contextual information. The experimental results show that different LLMs can achieve different testing effectiveness, with the GPT-4, GLM-4, and Baichuan2 LLMs generating the best web-form tests. Compared with GPT-4, the other LLMs had difficulty generating appropriate tests for the web forms: Their successfully-submitted rates (SSRs) — the proportions of the LLMs-generated web-form tests that could be successfully inserted into the web forms and submitted — decreased by 9.10% to 74.15%. Our findings also show that, for all LLMs, when the designed prompts include complete and clear contextual information about the web forms, more effective web-form tests were generated. Specifically, when using Parser-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (PH-P), the SSR averaged 70.63%, higher than the 60.21% for Raw HTML for Task Prompt (RH-P) and 50.27% for LLM-Processed HTML for Task Prompt (LH-P). With RH-P, GPT-4’s SSR was 98.86%, outperforming models like LLaMa2 (7B) with 34.47% and GLM-4V with 0%. Similarly, with PH-P, GPT-4 reached an SSR of 99.54%, the highest among all models and prompt types. Finally, this paper also highlights strategies for selecting LLMs based on performance metrics, and for optimizing the prompt design to improve the quality of the web-form tests.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:11:52","2025-09-10 14:11:52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Large Language Models (LLMs); Automated Web-Form Testing; Empirical Study; Java Web Applications; Web-Form-Test Generation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results demonstrate that while AutoKGQA performs well in certain cases, its domain-agnostic approach leads to systematic failures particularly in complex queries requiring implicit knowledge. We show that domain-specific prompting significantly enhances query accuracy, allowing even smaller LLMs to perform on par with larger ones.

The traditional method is described through an application prototype, while the methods that involve LLM are tested experimentally. To investigate the integral tasks related to LLMs, our experiments include (i) semantic annotation using the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) and Knowledge Graph (KG) generation with LLMs for a painting sample, and (ii) painting ranking relying solely on LLMs using catalog descriptions as input. The experiments demonstrate the potential of these methods to enhance artwork interpretation, description, and refinement of the results. Based on the relevant literature on traditional semantic annotation and conducted experiments with LLMs, a combination of ontologies and LLMs may provide an optimal approach, as it offers the accuracy of structured knowledge while providing a tool that interprets these elements into natural language and vice versa. Relying solely on LLMs may be risky due to the lack of domain-specific knowledge in the training data of LLMs, whereas traditional methods demand expertise in a specific domain and are more time-consuming.

Similarly, they have been shown to impact human and embodied virtual agent interaction. The process of selecting and animating meaningful gestures has thus become a key focus in designing embodied virtual agents. However, the automation of this gesture selection process poses a significant challenge. Prior gesture generation techniques have attempted to address this challenge in varied ways from fully automated, data-driven techniques – which often struggle to produce contextually meaningful gestures – to more manual approaches of crafting gesture expertise, which are time-consuming and lack generalizability. In this paper, we leverage the semantic capabilities of Large Language Models to realize a gesture selection approach that suggests meaningful, appropriate co-speech gestures. We first illustrate the information on gestures encoded into GPT4. Then we perform a study to specifically evaluate alternative prompting approaches for their ability to select meaningful, contextually relevant gestures and to align them appropriately to the co-speech utterance.

To improve the consistency and quality of emotional support, we developed and implemented a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), named dispatcherLLM, designed to suggest replies through simulating human dispatchers' languages with appropriate emotional support. We evaluated dispatcherLLM by comparing its generated responses to those of human dispatchers and other off-the-shelf models using real chat messages. Additionally, we conducted a human evaluation to assess the perceived effectiveness of the support provided by dispatcherLLM. This study not only contributes new empirical understandings of emotional support in text-based dispatch systems but also demonstrates the significant potential of generative AI in improving service delivery.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:11:52","2025-09-10 14:11:52","","","","2","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","large language models; emotion classification; event argument extraction; live chat; safety reporting; text-based reporting system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we introduce a technique that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automatically generate goal models from user stories. The approach uses Iterative Prompt Engineering that guides LLM to extract intentional elements and generate its XML-compatible representation in Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL). The generated models can be visualized using jUCMNav tool. We evaluated our approach using three LLMs: GPT-4, Llama and Cohere. Our qualitative evaluation indicates that GPT-4 or Llama can be used to assist requirements engineers in modeling as they can produce GRL goal models that are understandable.

The first part of the paper goes into great detail about how the AEKG4APT was constructed, including its ontology schema, data sources, and dataset features. There are also statistics on the AEKG4APT’s nodes, relationships, and key attributes.

We conduct a systematic evaluation across multiple ontological resources, including the Gene Ontology, Uberon, Wikidata, and ICD-10, using LLMs such as Pythia-12B, Gemini-1.5-Flash, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our findings reveal that only a small fraction of ontological concepts is accurately memorized, with GPT-4 demonstrating the highest performance. To understand why certain concepts are memorized more effectively than others, we analyze the relationship between memorization accuracy and concept popularity on the Web. Our results indicate a strong correlation between the frequency of a concept’s occurrence online and the likelihood of accurately retrieving its ID from the label. This suggests that LLMs primarily acquire such knowledge through indirect textual exposure rather than directly from structured ontological resources.

(2) Current video matching methodologies typically focus on cross-model alignment at general entity similarity level, without specific consideration for how entity pair preferences and similarity properties affect the task at hand.

While demonstrating unprecedented capabilities, LLMs have been found unreliable in tasks requiring factual knowledge and rigorous reasoning. Biomedicine and healthcare, as an important vertical domain rapidly benefitting from progress in AI, necessitates strict requirements on the accuracy, controllability, and interpretability of analytical models, posing critical challenges for LLMs. Despite recent studies addressing the hallucination problem of LLMs, research on empowering LLMs with the ability to plan, reason, and ground with explicit knowledge has also started to prosper, especially in the biomedicine and healthcare domain. On the other hand, biomedical data are enormous and notoriously complex, coming from various sources (e.g., biomedical knowledge bases, online literature, and hospitals) and bearing various modalities (e.g., tables, texts, images and time-series). Healthcare professionals have spent decades collecting, cleaning, and curating various types of data. The processes are extremely costly, producing various datasets with different data schemas, coding systems, and quality standards, many privately owned by the creators, making their integrative analysis and utilization through unified AI techniques still rather challenging. The generalizability of LLMs across different types of data endow them strong promises in automating the processing of large-scale complex healthcare data such as into unified knowledge graphs (KGs).

To reduce manual efforts in writing unit tests, some techniques have been proposed to generate test assertions automatically, including Deep Learning (DL)-based, retrieval-based, and integration-based ones. Among them, recent integration-based approaches inherit from both DL-based and retrieval-based approaches and are considered state-of-the-art. Despite being promising, such integration-based approaches suffer from inherent limitations, such as retrieving assertions with lexical matching while ignoring meaningful code semantics and generating assertions with a limited training corpus.In this article, we propose a novel Retrieval-Augmented Deep Assertion Generation (RetriGen) approach based on a hybrid assertion retriever and a Pre-Trained Language Model (PLM)-based assertion generator. Given a focal-test, RetriGen first builds a hybrid assertion retriever to search for the most relevant test–assert pair from external codebases. The retrieval process takes both lexical similarity and semantical similarity into account via a token-based and an embedding-based retriever, respectively. RetriGen then treats assertion generation as a sequence-to-sequence task and designs a PLM-based assertion generator to predict a correct assertion with historical test–assert pairs and the retrieved external assertion. Although our concept is general and can be adapted to various off-the-shelf encoder–decoder PLMs, we implement RetriGen to facilitate assertion generation based on the recent CodeT5 model. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate RetriGen against six state-of-the-art approaches across two large-scale datasets and two metrics. The experimental results demonstrate that RetriGen achieves 57.66% and 73.24% in terms of accuracy and CodeBLEU, outperforming all baselines with an average improvement of 50.66% and 14.14%, respectively. Furthermore, RetriGen generates 1,598 and 1,818 unique correct assertions that all baselines fail to produce, 3.71X and 4.58X more than the most recent approach EditAS. We also demonstrate that adopting other PLMs can provide substantial advancement, e.g., four additionally utilized PLMs outperform EditAS by 7.91%–12.70% accuracy improvement, indicating the generalizability of RetriGen. Overall, our study highlights the promising future of fine-tuning off-the-shelf PLMs to generate accurate assertions by incorporating external knowledge sources.","2025-08","2025-09-10 14:11:52","2025-09-10 14:11:52","","","","7","34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Pre-trained Language Models; AI4SE; Assertion Generation; Unit Testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, we propose ReaGen, an automated feature engineering (AutoFE) approach that combines knowledge graphs (KGs) with large language models (LLMs) to generate interpretable features. ReaGen begins by symbolic REAsoning over the KG to extract relevant information based on datasets description. Then, it uses an LLM to iteratively GENerate meaningful features. Finally, to overcome challenges such as hallucinations and handling long contexts typical in LLMs, our model performs logical reasoning on the KG to ensure that the generated features maintain interpretability. ReaGen provides Python code for automatic feature generation and detailed explanations of feature utility. It leverages both LLM's internal knowledge and retrieved information from KGs. Experiments on public datasets demonstrate that ReaGen significantly improves prediction accuracy while ensuring high interpretability through human-like explanations for each feature.

Link prediction methods predict missing facts in incomplete knowledge graphs, often using scalable embedding based solutions that, however, lack comprehensibility which is crucial in many domains. Filling this gap, explanation methods identify supporting knowledge. For evaluating them, user studies are the obvious choice as users are the main recipients of explanations. However, finding domain experts is often challenging. In contrast, an automated approach is to measure the influence of explanations on the very same link prediction task, thus disregarding the perspective of users. Additionally, current evaluation methods vary across different explanation approaches. We propose LP-DIXIT, the first protocol to evaluate the utility of explanations of link predictions. LP-DIXIT is user-aware, algorithmic and unique for different explanation methods. It builds on a typical setting of user studies, but adopts Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic users. Specifically, it measures how explanations improve the user (LLM) ability to perform predictions, which is key to trust. We experimentally proved an overall agreement between LP-DIXIT and user evaluations. Moreover, we adopted LP-DIXIT to conduct a comparative study of state-of-the-art explanation methods. The outcomes suggest that less is more: the most effective explanations are those consisting of a single fact.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:52","2025-09-10 14:11:52","","4034–4042","","","","","","","WWW '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sydney NSW, Australia","","","","knowledge graphs; large language models; explanation; link prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding specific bug types is crucial, as different bugs require tailored resolution strategies.This study addresses this gap by evaluating LLMs and prompt engineering strategies for fine-grained bug report categorization.

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shed light on the text mining field with their superior text understanding and instruction-following ability. There are typically two ways of utilizing LLMs: fine-tune the LLMs with human-annotated training data, which is labor intensive and hard to scale; prompt the LLMs in a zero-shot or few-shot way, which cannot take advantage of the useful information in the massive text data. Therefore, it remains a challenge on automated mining of structured knowledge from massive text data in the era of large language models. In this tutorial, we cover the recent advancements in mining structured knowledge using language models with very weak supervision. We will introduce the following topics in this tutorial: (1) introduction to large language models, which serves as the foundation for recent text mining tasks, (2) ontology construction, which automatically enriches an ontology from a massive corpus, (3) weakly-supervised text classification in flat and hierarchical label space, (4) weakly-supervised information extraction, which extracts entity and relation structures.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:53","2025-09-10 14:11:53","","6644–6654","","","","","","","KDD '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","large language models; text mining; weak supervision","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Zero-shot entity relation extraction relieves the dependence on labeled data in traditional method. Based on unlabeled text data, zero-shot entity relation extraction has strong domain adaptability, which is a very challenging and practical task. Recent work on large language models shows that large models can effectively complete downstream tasks through natural language instructions and have good generalization ability.

While numerous studies have examined more mainstream topics like consumer electronics, movies, and restaurants, relatively few have examined health and medical concerns. Considerable insight into where to direct efforts to improve public health might be gained by a study of how people feel about healthcare as a whole and of individual drug experiences in particular. When it comes to medicine, automatic analysis of online user evaluations paves the way for sifting through massive amounts of user feedback to find information regarding medications' efficacy and side effects that might be used to enhance pharmacovigilance programs. Simple rules-based methods have given way to more complex machine learning approaches like deep learning, which is developing as a technology for many natural language processing jobs. The opensource datasets have been analyzed with models that use word embeddings and term frequency-inverse document frequency (TF-IDF). A feature-enhanced text-inception model for sentiment classification was presented to work in tandem with this approach. The model first employed a cutting-edge text-inception module to glean useful shallow features from the text. K-MaxPooling was subsequently employed to reduce the dimensionality of its shallow and deep includes as well as enhance the generalization of characteristics, and a deep feature extraction module was formed using the bidirectional gated recurrent unit (Bi-GRU) and the capsule neural network to comprehend the text's semantic data. By combining traditional methods with cutting-edge artificial intelligence techniques, this hybrid approach can revolutionize public health initiatives, decision-making, and pharmacovigilance in the healthcare industry.

We argue that claims and practices by actors of the field still reflect this underlying conception of knowledge. We contrast this assumption with literature from social and, in particular, feminist epistemology, which argues that the idea of a universal disembodied knower is blind to the reality of knowledge practices and seriously challenges claims of ""objective"" or ""neutral"" knowledge. Knowledge enhancement techniques commonly use Wikidata and Wikipedia as their sources for knowledge, due to their large scales, public accessibility, and assumed trustworthiness. In this work, they serve as a case study for the influence of the social setting and the identity of knowers on epistemic processes. Indeed, the communities behind Wikidata and Wikipedia are known to be male-dominated and many instances of hostile behavior have been reported in the past decade. In effect, the contents of these knowledge bases are highly biased. It is therefore doubtful that these knowledge bases would contribute to bias reduction. In fact, our empirical evaluations of RoBERTa, KEPLER, and CoLAKE, demonstrate that knowledge enhancement may not live up to the hopes of increased objectivity. In our study, the average probability for stereotypical associations was preserved on two out of three metrics and performance-related gender gaps on knowledge-driven task were also preserved. We build on these results and critical literature to argue that the label of ""knowledge"" and the commonly held beliefs about it can obscure the harm that is still done to marginalized groups. Knowledge enhancement is at risk of perpetuating epistemic injustice, and AI engineers’ understanding of knowledge as objective per se conceals this injustice. Finally, to get closer to trustworthy language models, we need to rethink knowledge in AI and aim for an agenda of diversification and scrutiny from outgroup members.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:53","2025-09-10 14:11:53","","1433–1445","","","","","","","FAccT '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Rio de Janeiro, Brazil","","","","knowledge graphs; natural language processing; language models; epistemology; representation; bias; fairness; feminism; knowledge enhancement","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nonetheless, the complexity and extensive nature of standard documents present significant challenges in extraction, alignment, and organization. Traditional manual processing methods frequently prove labor-intensive and susceptible to errors, impeding the capturing of intricate relationships and hierarchies within these standards. Knowledge Graphs (KGs) provide a robust methodology for organizing information, facilitating improved functionalities for advanced search, reasoning, and analytics.

Building a corpus on novel themes to train machine learning methods in sentiment classification with high assurance, however, will be difficult. This study proposes a way for representing efficient features of a dataset into a word embedding layer of DL methods in sentiment classification known as KPRO (knowledge processing and representation based on ontology), a procedure to embed knowledge in the ontology of opinion datasets. This research proposes novel methods in ontology-based natural language processing utilizing feature extraction as well as classification by a DL technique. Here, input text has been taken as web ontology based text and is processed for word embedding. Then the feature mapping is carried out for this processed text using least square mapping in which the sentiment-based text has been mapped for feature extraction. The feature extraction is carried out using a Markov model based auto-feature encoder (MarMod_AuFeaEnCod). Extracted features are classified by utilizing hierarchical convolutional attention networks. Based on this classified output, the sentiment of the text obtained from web data has been analyzed.

Large-scale language models play an important role in current NLP. However, the challenges of explainability and complexity come along with the development of language models. One way is to introduce logical relations and rules into NLP models, such as making use of Automated Planning. Automated planning (AI planning) focuses on building symbolic domain models and synthesizing plans to transit initial states to goals based on domain models. Recently, there have been plenty of works related to those two fields, which have the abilities to generate explicit knowledge, e.g., preconditions and effects of action models, and learn from tacit knowledge, e.g., neural models, respectively. Integrating AI planning and NLP effectively improves the communication between human and intelligent agents. This article outlines the commons and relations between AI planning and NLP, and it argues that each of them can effectively impact the other one in six areas: (1) planning-based text understanding, (2) planning-based NLP, (3) text-based human–robot interaction, (4) planning-based explainability, (5) evaluation metrics, and (6) applications.

Traditional approaches have focused on overcoming fuzzy term representations through methods such as edit distance, Jaccard similarity, and more recently, embeddings and deep neural networks, including advancements from large language models (LLMs) like GPT. However, when integrating with external databases, the core challenge in entity matching extends beyond term fuzziness to the ambiguity in defining what constitutes a ""match"". This is because external databases contain tuples with varying levels of detail and granularity among entities, and an ""exact match"" in traditional entity matching rarely happens. As a result, understanding how entities are related and the potential nuances is critical, especially for high-stake tasks for responsible AI. In this work, we study a case problem of entity matching for ESG reporting. We propose a novel approach that shifts focus from purely identifying semantic similarities to understanding and defining the ""relations"" between entities for resolving ambiguities in matching, with a human-in-the-loop process to make the final decision.

Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, pre-trained language models have thus far only enabled modest improvements to the quality of such concept embeddings. Current strategies for using language models typically represent a concept by averaging the contextualised representations of its mentions in some corpus. This is potentially sub-optimal for at least two reasons. First, contextualised word vectors have an unusual geometry, which hampers downstream tasks. Second, concept embeddings should capture the semantic properties of concepts, whereas contextualised word vectors are also affected by other factors. To address these issues, we propose two contrastive learning strategies, based on the view that whenever two sentences reveal similar properties, the corresponding contextualised vectors should also be similar. One strategy is fully unsupervised, estimating the properties which are expressed in a sentence from the neighbourhood structure of the contextualised word embeddings. The second strategy instead relies on a distant supervision signal from ConceptNet. Our experimental results show that the resulting vectors substantially outperform existing concept embeddings in predicting the semantic properties of concepts, with the ConceptNet-based strategy achieving the best results. These findings are furthermore confirmed in a clustering task and in the downstream task of ontology completion.","2023","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","216–226","","","","","","","SIGIR '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Taipei, Taiwan","","","","language models; word embedding; commonsense knowledge; contrastive learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing few-shot audio recognition methods based on audio-language models primarily focus on learning coarse-grained correlations, which are not sufficient to capture the intricate matching patterns between the multi-level information of audio and the diverse characteristics of category concepts. To address this gap, we propose multi-grained correspondence learning for bootstrapping audio-language models to improve audio recognition with few training samples. This approach leverages generative models to enrich multi-modal representation learning, mining the multi-level information of audio alongside the diverse characteristics of category concepts.

Although previous studies validate that LLMs perform well on general knowledge while presenting poor performance on long-tail nuanced knowledge, the community is still doubtful about whether the traditional knowledge graphs should be replaced by LLMs. In this paper, we ask if the schema of knowledge graph (i.e., taxonomy) is made obsolete by LLMs. Intuitively, LLMs should perform well on common taxonomies and at taxonomy levels that are common to people. Unfortunately, there lacks a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates the LLMs over a wide range of taxonomies from common to specialized domains and at levels from root to leaf so that we can draw a confident conclusion. To narrow the research gap, we constructed a novel taxonomy hierarchical structure discovery benchmark named TaxoGlimpse to evaluate the performance of LLMs over taxonomies. TaxoGlimpse covers ten representative taxonomies from common to specialized domains with in-depth experiments of different levels of entities in this taxonomy from root to leaf. Our comprehensive experiments of eighteen LLMs under three prompting settings validate that LLMs perform miserably poorly in handling specialized taxonomies and leaf-level entities. Specifically, the QA accuracy of the best LLM drops by up to 30% as we go from common to specialized domains and from root to leaf levels of taxonomies.","2024-07","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","2919–2932","","11","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper focuses on creativity, defined as consensual agreement among domain experts. It presents an inductive analysis of seven semi-structured interviews with professional playwrights who engaged in a longitudinal project with the aim of writing a theatre script using commercial systems. Overall, participants regarded LLMs as unsuitable for playwrighting. However, they enjoyed the experience and identified utility for editorial tasks and brainstorming. A significant obstacle was associated with the politics embedded in LLMs. Not only did these systems avoid a language that could offend sensibilities, but they also refused to engage in taboos and conflicts, which are the core of dramaturgy. Other system features (speed, exploitation, and unpredictability) were sometimes considered conducive and sometimes detrimental to creativity. Participants experienced difficulties and tried to build common ground by trial and error. Often, this strategy evolved into role play: the playwright instructed the LLM to enact characters. The interaction provided hints of inspiration and fostered suspension of disbelief and ontological reflection. However, it often led to technology rejection.

Sir Tim Berners-Lee's seminal work ”Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web”, envisioned a World Wide Web where information is not only accessible but structured, allowing machines to interpret data meaningfully. This vision laid the groundwork for technologies such as RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web Ontology Language), which serve as foundational components for modern KGs.However, the process of building domain-specific KGs from extensive text corpora is highly complex and resource-intensive, requiring careful task design for entity recognition, disambiguation, and relationship extraction, among others. These tasks are essential to ensure accuracy and relevance in knowledge representation, but they pose considerable challenges. Addressing these complexities is crucial for the continued advancement and application of KGs across domains.In this context, the 4th NLP4KGC workshop is held to create a collaborative platform for researchers, practitioners, and industry experts in NLP and KG construction. Following the success and growing community engagement in the previous three editions, this year's workshop aims to deepen collaboration and encourage innovative solutions in this rapidly evolving field.

Approaches to automatic gesture generation vary not only in the degree to which they rely on data-driven techniques but also the degree to which they can produce context and speaker specific gestures. However, these approaches face two major challenges: The first is obtaining sufficient training data that is appropriate for the context and the goal of the application. The second is related to designer control to realize their specific intent for the application. Here, we approach these challenges by using large language models (LLMs) to show that these powerful models of large amounts of data can be adapted for gesture analysis and generation. Specifically, we used ChatGPT as a tool for suggesting context-specific gestures that can realize designer intent based on minimal prompts.

However, most language models for radiology report summarization utilize a softmax transformation in their output layer, leading to dense alignments and strictly positive output probabilities. This density is inefficient, reducing model interpretability and giving probability mass to many unrealistic outputs. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel approach named nucleusmax. Nucleusmax is able to mitigate dense outputs and improve model interpretability by truncating the unreliable tail of the probability distribution. In addition, we incorporate nucleusmax with a copy mechanism, a useful technique to avoid professional errors in the generated diagnostic opinions. To further promote the research of radiology report summarization, we also have created a Chinese radiology report summarization dataset, which is freely available. Experimental results showed via both automatic and human evaluation that the proposed approach substantially improves the sparsity and overall quality of outputs over competitive softmax models, producing radiology summaries that approach the quality of those authored by physicians.

Conceptual modelling plays a critical role in the information system design process and usually involves domain experts and knowledge engineers who brainstorm together to identify the required knowledge to build an information system. The conceptual modelling process starts with the collection of necessary information from the domain experts by the knowledge engineers. Afterwards, the knowledge engineers use traditional model driven engineering techniques to design the system based on the collected information. Natural language–based conceptual modelling frameworks or systems are used to help domain experts and knowledge engineers in eliciting requirements and building conceptual models from a natural language text. In this article, we discuss the state of the art of some recent conceptual modelling frameworks that are based on natural language. We take a closer look at how these frameworks are built, in particular at the underlying motivation, architecture, types of natural language used (e.g., restricted vs. unrestricted), types of the conceptual model generated, verification support of the requirements specifications as well as the conceptual models, and underlying knowledge representation formalism.

However, as they often contain references to the same entities, the delicate issue of entity alignment becomes the central challenge, especially in the absence or scarcity of unique global identifiers.

This lack of interpretability is significantly limiting the adoption of such models in domains where decisions are critical such as the medical and legal fields. Recently, researchers have been interested in developing methods that help explain individual decisions and decipher the hidden representations of machine learning models in general and deep networks specifically. While there has been a recent explosion of work on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (ExAI) on deep models that operate on imagery and tabular data, textual datasets present new challenges to the ExAI community. Such challenges can be attributed to the lack of input structure in textual data, the use of word embeddings that add to the opacity of the models and the difficulty of the visualization of the inner workings of deep models when they are trained on textual data.Lately, methods have been developed to address the aforementioned challenges and present satisfactory explanations on Natural Language Processing (NLP) models. However, such methods are yet to be studied in a comprehensive framework where common challenges are properly stated and rigorous evaluation practices and metrics are proposed.Motivated to democratize ExAI methods in the NLP field, we present in this work a survey that studies model-agnostic as well as model-specific explainability methods on NLP models. Such methods can either develop inherently interpretable NLP models or operate on pre-trained models in a post hoc manner. We make this distinction and we further decompose the methods into three categories according to what they explain: (1) word embeddings (input level), (2) inner workings of NLP models (processing level), and (3) models’ decisions (output level). We also detail the different evaluation approaches interpretability methods in the NLP field. Finally, we present a case-study on the well-known neural machine translation in an appendix, and we propose promising future research directions for ExAI in the NLP field.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","","","5","55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","NLP; language models; transformers; ExAI; explaining decisions; neural machine translation; transparent embedding models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering a potential pathogen's molecular interactions, specifically individual proteins and protein interactions can help pinpoint a potential protein of a given microbe to cause disease. However, existing tools for pathogen screening rely on existing annotations (KEGG, GO, etc), making the assessment of novel and unannotated proteins more challenging. Here, we present an LLM-inspired approach that considers protein sequence and structure to predict protein virulence.

However, this also brings high computational and storage costs. In this paper, we present a new direction to improve PLMs without scaling parameters and data: adopting a geometric feature space that is more suitable for encoding the intrinsic structured features of text. Although text is generally considered unstructured data, it possesses rich intrinsic structured features that signify syntactic and semantic relationships. Leveraging these structured features is vital for text understanding. Given that structured features are better encoded in hyperbolic spaces than in the Euclidean spaces used by conventional PLMs, we propose that PLMs should operate entirely within hyperbolic spaces. Our experiments demonstrate the superiority of hyperbolic PLMs over Euclidean PLMs across a wide variety of tasks, using the same parameter and data settings. This suggests that altering the geometry of model representation is a promising direction for model enhancement.","2024-05","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","3101–3112","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

AngleKindling helped journalists deeply engage with the press release and recognize angles that were useful for multiple types of stories. From our findings, we discuss how to help journalists customize and identify promising angles, and extending AngleKindling to other knowledge-work domains.","2023","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","","","","","","","","CHI '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamburg, Germany","","","","Large Language Models; Generative AI; Brainstorming; Ideation; Journalism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While this scheme may boost prediction for common diseases and drugs, it can hinder the learning of generalizable representations, leading to more false positives/negatives. To address this limitation, we introduce CLaDMoP, a new pre-training approach for clinical trial outcome prediction, alongside the Successful Clinical Trials dataset (SCT), specifically designed for this task. CLaDMoP leverages a Large Language Model-to encode trials' eligibility criteria-linked to a lightweight Drug-Molecule branch through a novel multi-level fusion technique. To efficiently fuse long embeddings across levels, we incorporate a grouping block, drastically reducing computational overhead. CLaDMoP avoids reliance on task-specific objectives by pre-training on a ”pair matching” proxy task. Compared to established zero-shot and few-shot baselines, our method significantly improves both PR-AUC and ROC-AUC, especially for phase I and phase II trials. We further evaluate and perform ablation on CLaDMoP after Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning, comparing it to state-of-the-art supervised baselines, including MEXA-CTP, on the Trial Outcome Prediction (TOP) benchmark. CLaDMoP achieves up to 10.5% improvement in PR-AUC and 3.6% in ROC-AUC, while attaining comparable F1 score to MEXA-CTP, highlighting its potential for clinical trial outcome prediction.

A key technique for SLU is Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), which transcribes speech signals into text contents. As the output texts of modern ASR systems unavoidably contain errors, mainstream SLU models either trained or tested on texts transcribed by ASR systems would not be sufficiently error robust. We present ARoBERT, an ASR Robust BERT model, which can be fine-tuned to solve a variety of SLU tasks with noisy inputs. To guarantee the robustness of ARoBERT, during pretraining, we decrease the fluctuations of language representations when some parts of the input texts are replaced by homophones or synophones. Specifically, we propose two novel self-supervised pre-training tasks for ARoBERT, namely Phonetically-aware Masked Language Modeling (PMLM) and ASR Model-adaptive Masked Language Modeling (AMMLM). The PMLM task explicitly fuses the knowledge of word phonetic similarities into the pre-training process, which forces homophones and synophones to share similar representations. In AMMLM, a data-driven algorithm is further introduced to mine typical ASR errors such that ARoBERT can tolerate ASR model errors. In the experiments, we evaluate ARoBERT over multiple datasets. The results show the superiority of ARoBERT, which consistently outperforms strong baselines. We have also shown that ARoBERT outperforms state-of-the-arts on a public benchmark.

The electric power industry is an information-intensive domain involving extensive data processing, predictive analysis, and decision-making. Therefore, the application of large language models in the electric power sector is of great significance. Current large language models such as GPT3.5 and GLM can perform well in tasks such as question answering dialogues. However, these models still face challenges such as answer hallucination and inaccurate responses. This paper proposes a method to enhance question answering in large language models using knowledge graphs, aiming to improve the accuracy and reliability of these models in question answering tasks in the electric power domain.The proposed method first utilizes local electric power data to extract triplets and generate a question answering dataset specific to the electric power domain using a large language model. Then, the relationships of the knowledge graph triplets are incorporated into the question prompt to enhance the quality of the model's answers. Furthermore, we fine-tune the large language model using the expanded question set derived from the triplets as knowledge enhanced data. Subsequently, we conduct experiments on both an electric power question answering dataset and a knowledge graph question answering dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves various metrics of the large language model in the electric power question answering task. This research provides new insights and approaches to enhance the effectiveness of question answering systems in the electric power domain. Future studies can further explore and optimize this prompt expansion method for application in broader domains and tasks.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:54","2025-09-10 14:11:54","","24–29","","","","","","","EITCE '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xiamen, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This includes techniques for generating perceptually meaningful visual encodings, using NLP for query interpretation and ambiguity resolution, and designing conversational interfaces that align with users' intent. The tutorial will highlight research from a broad set of contributors in the SIGMOD/VLDB, HCI, and visualization communities, spanning natural language interfaces for databases, multimodal interaction systems, semantic search for data repositories, and the use of AI and large language models to augment visual and textual analysis.As part of this 1.5-hour session, we will present case studies and systems that demonstrate how human-centric design can be integrated into the data analysis pipeline, including tools that support mixed-initiative interaction, adaptive defaults, and subjective query interpretation. We will also discuss open challenges and research opportunities, such as semantic inferencing for unstructured data, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and ethical considerations around fairness, explainability, and user agency.

We propose and evaluate Evaporate, a prototype system powered by LLMs. We identify two strategies for implementing this system: prompt the LLM to directly extract values from documents or prompt the LLM to synthesize code that performs the extraction. Our evaluations show a cost-quality tradeoff between these two approaches. Code synthesis is cheap, but far less accurate than directly processing each document with the LLM. To improve quality while maintaining low cost, we propose an extended implementation, Evaporate-Code+, which achieves better quality than direct extraction. Our insight is to generate many candidate functions and ensemble their extractions using weak supervision. Evaporate-Code+ outperforms the state-of-the art systems using a sublinear pass over the documents with the LLM.

However, the process of conducting a Systematic Literature Review manually can be difficult and time-consuming. For this reason, researchers aim to semi-automate this process or some of its phases. Aim: We aimed at using a deep-learning based contextualized embeddings clustering technique involving transformer-based language models and a weighted scheme to accelerate the conduction phase of Systematic Literature Reviews for efficiently scanning the initial set of retrieved publications. Method: We performed an experiment using two manually conducted SLRs to evaluate the performance of two deep-learning-based clustering models. These models build on transformer-based deep language models (i.e., BERT and S-BERT) to extract contextualized embeddings on different text levels along with a weighted scheme to cluster similar publications. Results: Our primary results show that clustering based on embedding at paragraph-level using S-BERT-paragraph represents the best performing model setting in terms of optimizing the required parameters such as correctly identifying primary studies, number of additional documents identified as part of the relevant cluster and the execution time of the experiments. Conclusions: The findings indicate that using natural-language-based deep-learning architectures for semi-automating the selection of primary studies can accelerate the scanning and identification process. While our results represent first insights only, such a technique seems to enhance SLR process, promising to help researchers identify the most relevant publications more quickly and efficiently.","2023","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","67–74","","","","","","","NLBSE '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania","","","","BERT; deep learning; language models; systematic literature review","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As more systems move into distributed worlds, e.g. cloud and microservices, and developers make increasing use of libraries and frameworks, the need to interact with a range of data formats and configuration mechanisms is only increasing. This is a treacherous world, where a misspelled property name or missing field can render an entire service inoperable, a mistake that a number in an API represents seconds instead of milli-seconds can lead to a message being set for delivery in several months instead of in an hour, misconfigured schema can lead to public exposure of sensitive data, and corrupt or erroneous results from a misunderstood data format could result in massive financial and/or reputational damage. To address these challenges this paper casts the problems of data and configuration descriptions, not as a problem of data representation, but as a type system problem, that can be addressed with well understood and highly effective programming language techniques! The novel challenge is that data representation and configuration are universal concerns in a system and, particularly in modern cloud or micro-service systems, these systems may involve many programming languages. In the past this has led to specification systems that use a least-common-denominator set of data types, often little more than strings and numbers, and then rely on conventions or (out-of-date) documentation to ensure that the data is interpreted correctly. This paper shows that, with careful design, it is possible to create a rich universal system that can be used to express data and configuration specifications in a way that is human readable/writable and that can be produced/consumed, much like JSON, by a wide range of programming languages and systems.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","147–161","","","","","","","Onward!

However, with the advancement of artificial intelligence technology, the emergence of large language models provides a new technological solution to address this issue. Large language models, based on deep learning techniques, have the capability to quickly understand and interpret specialized terminology in the electricity domain through learning from a vast corpus of professional literature and data. They can then be applied to various domains, including question-answering systems. However, existing large language models still face issues of unreliable outputs, necessitating a method to evaluate their results and improve the quality of their applications. We propose a knowledge graph-based credibility evaluation method for electric grid large language model knowledge question-answering. This method aligns the answers generated by large language models with the knowledge graph of a local knowledge base and calculates their cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient. We batch-process the answers from the large language model into an electricity dataset and validate them using this method. Experimental results demonstrate that this method can accurately and efficiently reflect the relevance between texts, providing a reliable scoring basis for question-answering by large models in vertical domains. Future research can focus on exploring other embedding methods that can better extract semantic relationships between texts and validating the feasibility of this method in vertical domains other than electricity.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","754–759","","","","","","","EITCE '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xiamen, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The construction process of CGIR incorporates an attention mechanism, significantly boosting its performance and accuracy. Through this fusion, concept graphs offer a comprehensive representation of texts, capturing the essence of the entire content while minimizing the displayed information, all while preserving the original meaning of the text to the fullest extent possible.

The requirements of enabling the model to achieve the reliable performance, including the scale of required annotated data and the effective framework, are not well guided. To address the first question, we empirically investigate the cost-effectiveness of several methods for training intent classification and slot-filling models from scratch in Indonesia (ID) using English data. Confronting the second challenge, we propose a Bi-Confidence-Frequency Cross-Lingual transfer framework (BiCF), which consists of “BiCF Mixing”, “Latent Space Refinement” and “Joint Decoder”, respectively, to overcome the lack of low-resource language dialogue data. BiCF Mixing based on the word-level alignment strategy generates code-mixed data by utilizing the importance-frequency and translating-confidence. Moreover, Latent Space Refinement trains a new dialogue understanding model using code-mixed data and word embedding models. Joint Decoder based on Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Conditional Random Field (CRF) is used to obtain experimental results of intent classification and slot-filling. We also release a large-scale fine-labeled Indonesia dialogue dataset (ID-WOZ1) and ID-BERT for experiments. BiCF achieves 93.56% and 85.17% (F1 score) on intent classification and slot filling, respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework performs reliably and cost-efficiently on different scales of manually annotated Indonesian data.","2023-04","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Dialogue datasets; indonesian; intent classification; slot-filling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, Chat GPT has context-awareness and personalization capacity and is open to user control. Therefore, rather than decolonizing Chat GPT itself, decolonizing by Chat GPT can be a flipped approach to materialize decolonial persuasion in language pedagogy. Grounded in Santos's epistemology of the south, this paper attempts to conceptualize Chat GPT-assisted decolonial pedagogy. Using the authors’ constructivist ideation, the study employed simulated text data generated through a series of Chat GPT-author conversations. The collected data were analyzed by applying the educational data mining (EDM) method to support the primary conceptualization of the proposed decolonial pedagogy.

Motivated by this, integrating LLMs with GNNs has been increasingly studied to acquire transferable knowledge across modalities, which leads to improved empirical performance in language and graph domains. However, existing studies mainly focused on a single-domain scenario by designing complicated integration techniques to manage multimodal data effectively. Therefore, a concise and generic learning framework for multi-domain tasks, i.e., graph and language domains, is highly desired yet remains under-exploited due to two major challenges. First, the language corpus of downstream tasks differs significantly from graph data, making it hard to bridge the knowledge gap between modalities. Second, not all knowledge demonstrates immediate benefits for downstream tasks, potentially introducing disruptive noise to context-sensitive models like LLMs. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel plug-and-play framework for incorporating a lightweight cross-domain prompting method into both language and graph learning tasks. Specifically, we first convert the textual input into a domain-scalable prompt, which not only preserves the semantic and logical contents of the textual input, but also highlights related graph information as external knowledge for different domains. Then, we develop a reinforcement learning-based method to learn the optimal edge selection strategy for useful knowledge extraction, which profoundly sharpens the multi-domain model capabilities. In addition, we introduce a joint multi-view optimization module to regularize agent-level collaborative learning across two domains. Finally, extensive empirical justifications over 23 public and synthetic datasets demonstrate that our approach can be applied to diverse multi-domain tasks more accurately, robustly, and reasonably, and improve the performances of the state-of-the-art graph and language models in different learning paradigms.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","1301–1312","","","","","","","KDD '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","large language models; prompt learning; graph neural networks; reinforcement learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For Large Language Models (LLMs), this trust requires transparent, verifiable, and rigorously reviewed information sources. This paper presents an AI-powered tool for differential diagnosis and disease comparison, utilizing an LLM enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG overcomes traditional LLM limitations by enabling access to external, domain-specific knowledge, ensuring accurate and contextually relevant responses. The system leverages PubMed, a biomedical article aggregator, to extract symptom-related information from scientific literature on various disorders. Evaluations involving psychologist-administered questionnaires demonstrate that combining a similarity score with detailed symptom descriptions provides a clear understanding of relationships between disorders. This approach may enhance diagnostic precision and build trust in AI-driven tools, encouraging their broader adoption in clinical practice.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","277–284","","","","","","","PETRA '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Large Language Models; Retrieval-Augmented Generation; Differential diagnosis; e-Health","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The majority of existing PPI research has relied mainly on sequence-based approaches. With the availability of multi-omics datasets (sequence, 3D structure) and advancements in deep learning techniques, it is feasible to develop a deep multi-modal framework that fuses the features learned from different sources of information to predict PPI. In this work, we propose a multi-modal approach utilizing protein sequence and 3D structure. To extract features from the 3D structure of proteins, we use a pre-trained vision transformer model that has been fine-tuned on the structural representation of proteins. The protein sequence is encoded into a feature vector using a pre-trained language model. The feature vectors extracted from the two modalities are fused and then fed to the neural network classifier to predict the protein interactions. To showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, we conduct experiments on two popular PPI datasets, namely, the human dataset and the &lt;italic&gt;S. cerevisiae&lt;/italic&gt; dataset. Our approach outperforms the existing methodologies to predict PPI, including multi-modal approaches. We also evaluate the contributions of each modality by designing uni-modal baselines.

The information that is available online usually includes only an archival finding aid, instead of metadata about the individual records, or fully digital versions of the records. While cataloguing standards for archival descriptions of architectural records have existed at least since the 1980s, the rise of Linked Open Data as a framework for publishing cultural heritage data has allowed archivists to enhance these archival descriptions with richer contextual information and links to external knowledge bases. In this paper we present the ITDT ontology, an extension of the Records in Contexts Ontology that facilitates the representation of architectural records and of the context related to architectural projects, its process, and participating entities.

Current methods primarily focus on learning embeddings for atomic concepts and roles, enabling the evaluation based on normalized axioms through specially designed score functions. However, they often neglect the embedding of complex concepts, making it difficult to infer with more intricate axioms. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in advanced reasoning tasks, such as Ontology Learning and ontology-mediated Query Answering.

But LLMs still face limitations due to hallucinations, semantic ambiguity, and lexical mismatches between an NL query and the database schema. Naturally, a lot of work in the ML+DB intersection aims to mitigate such LLM limitations. In this work, we shine the light on a complementary data-centric question: How should DB schemas evolve in this era of LLMs to boost NL-to-SQL? The intuition is that more NL-friendly schema identifiers can help LLMs work better with DBs. We dive deeper into this seemingly obvious, but hitherto underexplored and important, connection between schema identifier ”naturalness” and the behavior of LLM-based NL-to-SQL by creating a new integrated benchmark suite we call SNAILS. SNAILS has 4 novel artifacts: (1) A collection of real-world DB schemas not present in prior NL-to-SQL benchmarks; (2) A set of labeled NL-SQL query pairs on our collection not seen before by public LLMs; (3) A notion of naturalness level for schema identifiers and a novel labeled dataset of modified identifiers; and (4) AI artifacts to automatically modify identifier naturalness. Using SNAILS, we perform a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the impact of schema naturalness on LLM-based NL-to-SQL accuracy, and present a method for improving LLM-based NL-to-SQL with natural views. Our results reveal statistically significant correlations across multiple public LLMs from OpenAI, Meta, and Google on multiple databases using both zero-shot prompting as well as more complex NL-to-SQL workflows: DIN SQL, and CodeS. We present several fine-grained insights and discuss pathways for DB practitioners to better exploit LLMs for NL-to-SQL.","2025-02","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","database; llm; benchmark; natural language to sql; relational database schema; schema design; schema linking; schema naturalness","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It typically involves two meta-levels: one includes meta-models that describe modelling languages, and the other contains models built by instantiating those meta-models. Multi-level modelling generalizes this approach by allowing models to span an arbitrary number of meta-levels. A scenario that profits from multi-level modelling is the definition of language families that can be specialized (e.g., for different domains) by successive refinements at subsequent meta-levels, hence promoting language reuse. This enables an open set of variability options given by all possible specializations of the language family. However, multi-level modelling lacks the ability to express closed variability regarding the availability of language primitives or the possibility to opt between alternative primitive realizations. This limits the reuse opportunities of a language family. To improve this situation, we propose a novel combination of product lines with multi-level modelling to cover both open and closed variability. Our proposal is backed by a formal theory that guarantees correctness, enables top-down and bottom-up language variability design, and is implemented atop the MetaDepth multi-level modelling tool.","2021-12","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","1173–1208","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Berlin, Heidelberg Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","","","Domain-specific languages; Meta-modelling; MetaDepth; Multi-level modelling; Product lines; Software language engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, graphical policy configuration tools are prone to human errors, making them unusable. On the other hand, automated policy generation frameworks are prone to erroneous predictions, making them unreliable. Therefore, to find ways to improve their usability and reliability, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review analyzing 49 publications. The thematic analysis of the publications revealed that graphical policy configuration tools are developed to write and visualize policies manually. Moreover, automated policy generation frameworks are developed using machine learning (ML) and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to automatically generate access control policies from high-level requirement specifications. Despite their utility in the access control domain, limitations of these tools, such as the lack of flexibility, and limitations of frameworks, such as the lack of domain adaptation, negatively affect their usability and reliability, respectively. Our study offers recommendations to address these limitations through real-world applications and recent advancements in the NLP domain, paving the way for future research.","2024-12","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","","","4","57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Access control; frameworks; policy engineering; reliability; system administrator; usability; user interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Greek language resources, in particular, have become widely available and are frequently discussed in the context of LLM development for tailored or custom use. The development of large language models presents several challenges, one of which is data preparation, which must be of high quality and grounded in linguistic, conceptual, and historical foundations. Creating data sets of this nature is a highly complex task. This study focuses on the collection, curation, and management of data sets for the Greek language, as well as making the data provision for use in training custom Greek LLMs smoother, not only for custom LLM development but also for fine-tuning existing LLM models. Immediately after the ChatGPT invention, the GlossAPI project initiative started in 2023. This research encourages the need for a Greek data pile creation, which is further dependent upon the data collection, acquisition, data cleaning, annotation, and classification steps. Upon cleaning the data pile, storage of the data pile and serving it to the LLMs or other users is the main concern. This concern is resolved by the use of an integrative, capable database solution that can facilitate in-database inference, including data collection, annotation, classification, and storage. For each of these stages, a special protocol requires, for instance, the use of existing LLMs or other artificial intelligence models for data preprocessing, annotation, and classification. To store data, we need a database that can seamlessly integrate with other data resources. Our study aim at the development of an architecture to unite Greek data pile and intelligent AI models at a one place using MindsDB integrative capabilities. MindsDB is an emerging database with an integration functionality to wide variety of AI models which can facilitate the data processing, annotation, classification through the integration of Supervised, unsupervised, and even though LLMs models.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:55","2025-09-10 14:11:55","","16–25","","","","","","","PCI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Large Language Models; Natural Language Processing; Generative Pre-Trained Transformers; Large Scale Language Corpora; Pre-Trained Language Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a result, we generate a parallel corpus from the comparable corpus. For this purpose, the sentences (which are translations of each other) are mined from the comparable corpus to prepare the parallel corpus.

Then, the sentence pairs that are poor translations of each other (measured by a similarity score based on IBM model 1 translation probability) are filtered out. We apply this algorithm to comparable corpora, which are crawled from speeches of the President and Vice-President of India, and mined parallel corpora out of them.

Recent development of protein language models (pLMs) with supervised fine tuning provides a promising solution to this problem. However, the fine-tuned model is tailored for particular downstream prediction task, and achieving general-purpose protein understanding remains a challenge. In this paper, we introduce Structure-Enhanced Protein Instruction Tuning (SEPIT) framework to bridge this gap. Our approach incorporates a novel structure-aware module into pLMs to enrich their structural knowledge, and subsequently integrates these enhanced pLMs with large language models (LLMs) to advance protein understanding. In this framework, we propose a novel instruction tuning pipeline. First, we warm up the enhanced pLMs using contrastive learning and structure denoising. Then, caption-based instructions are used to establish a basic understanding of proteins. Finally, we refine this understanding by employing a mixture of experts (MoEs) to capture more complex properties and functional information with the same number of activated parameters. Moreover, we construct the largest and most comprehensive protein instruction dataset to date, which allows us to train and evaluate the general-purpose protein understanding model. Extensive experiments on both open-ended generation and closed-set answer tasks demonstrate the superior performance of SEPIT over both closed-source general LLMs and open-source LLMs trained with protein knowledge.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","3216–3227","","","","","","","KDD '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto ON, Canada","","","","large language models; protein; insturction tuning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the different knowledge backgrounds of ontology developers, the entities in the ontologies could be defined in different ways, which hamper the communications among the intelligent applications built on them. How to find the semantic relationships among the entities that are lexicalized in different languages is called the Cross-lingual Ontology Matching problem (COM), which is a challenge problem in the ontology matching domain. To face this challenge, being inspired by the success of the Genetic Algorithm&nbsp;(GA) in the ontology matching domain, this work proposes a Compact GA with Annealing Re-sample Inheritance mechanism (CGA-ARI) to efficiently address the COM problem. In particular, a Cross-lingual Similarity Metric (CSM) is presented to distinguish two cross-lingual entities, a discrete optimal model is built to define the COM problem, and the compact encoding mechanism and the Annealing Re-sample Inheritance mechanism (ARI) are introduced to improve CGA’s searching performance.

Knowledge graphs (KGs) represent semantically rich and well-organized data spanning various domains, such as DBLP, DBpedia, and YAGO. Traditionally, dialogue benchmarks have been manually created from documents, neglecting the potential of KGs in automating this process. Some question-answering benchmarks are automatically generated using extensive preprocessing from KGs, but they do not support dialogue generation. This paper introduces Chatty-Gen, a novel multi-stage retrieval-augmented generation platform for automatically generating high-quality dialogue benchmarks tailored to a specific domain using a KG. Chatty-Gen decomposes the generation process into manageable stages and uses assertion rules for automatic validation between stages. Our approach enables control over intermediate results to prevent time-consuming restarts due to hallucinations. It also reduces reliance on costly and more powerful commercial LLMs. Chatty-Gen eliminates upfront processing of the entire KG using efficient query-based retrieval to find representative subgraphs based on the dialogue context. Our experiments with several real and large KGs demonstrate that Chatty-Gen significantly outperforms state-of-the-art systems and ensures consistent model and system performance across multiple LLMs of diverse capabilities, such as GPT-4o, Gemini 1.5, Llama 3, and Mistral.","2025-02","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","","","1","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","benchmarking; assertion-based validation; conversational question answering; cost-effecive inference; graph serialization; knowledge graphs (kgs); large language models (llms); retrieval-augumented generation (rag)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We evaluate several state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to autonomously produce functionally correct Python code for preprocessing and Gaussian Process modeling. Our results show that, when guided by structured semantic context, larger LLMs can reliably generate accurate pipelines, significantly reducing the need for manual intervention.

With the proprietary nature of many AI systems, there is a lack of open-source requirements artifacts and technical requirements documents for AI systems, limiting broader research and investigation. With Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as a promising alternative to human-generated text, this paper investigates the potential use of LLMs to generate user stories for AI systems based on abstracts from scholarly papers. We conducted an empirical evaluation using three LLMs and generated 1260 user stories from 42 abstracts from 26 domains. We assess their quality using the Quality User Story (QUS) framework. Moreover, we identify relevant non-functional requirements (NFRs) and ethical principles. Our analysis demonstrates that the investigated LLMs can generate user stories inspired by the needs of various stakeholders, offering a promising approach for generating user stories for research purposes and for aiding in the early requirements elicitation phase of AI systems.

This research proposes a novel framework combining narrative-driven storytelling with location-based RSs to promote physical activity and immersive urban exploration. This approach introduces a bidirectional alignment between POI and itinerary recommendations and LLM-generated narratives, transforming routine urban walks into dynamic journeys where contextually relevant stories unfold across city locations. Unlike sequential POI recommendations, this framework embeds location suggestions within contextually relevant narratives of various genres, simultaneously promoting health benefits and deeper city exploration. The research addresses three research questions using a method that builds a structured knowledge base by extracting entities (e.g., POIs, and characters) and semantic links from narrative corpora, enabling semantic alignment between recommended physical locations and story elements. The core aspects of this work are: (i) context-aware itinerary recommendations and personalized story generation, (ii) bidirectional mapping between RSs and story generation, and (iii) systems design bridging user’s needs to promote urban walking as a health activity.

As using pre-trained language models is the de facto standard for natural language processing tasks, many recent studies use them to encode the dialogue context for predicting the dialogue states. Model architectures that have certain inductive biases for modeling the relationship among different domain-slot pairs are also emerging. Our work is based on these research approaches on multi-domain dialogue state tracking. We propose a model architecture that effectively models the relationship among domain-slot pairs using a pre-trained language encoder. Inspired by the way the special &lt;inline-formula&gt;&lt;tex-math notation=""LaTeX""&gt;[CLS]&lt;/tex-math&gt;&lt;/inline-formula&gt; token in BERT is used to aggregate the information of the whole sequence, we use multiple special tokens for each domain-slot pair that encodes information corresponding to its domain and slot. The special tokens are run together with the dialogue context through the pre-trained language encoder, which effectively models the relationship among different domain-slot pairs. Our experimental results on the datasets MultiWOZ-2.0 and MultiWOZ-2.1 show that our model outperforms other models with the same setting. Our ablation studies incorporate three main parts. The first component shows the effectiveness of our approach exploiting the relationship modeling. The second component compares the effect of using different pre-trained language encoders. The final component involves comparing different initialization methods that could be used for the special tokens. Qualitative analysis of the attention map of the pre-trained language encoder shows that our special tokens encode relevant information through the encoding process by attending to each other.","2022-06","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","2091–2102","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A foundational step toward addressing this gap is the identification and organization of knowledge components (KCs) that underlie data science problem solving (DSPS). KCs represent conditional knowledge-knowing about appropriate actions given particular contexts or conditions-and correspond to the critical decisions data scientists must make throughout the problem-solving process. While existing taxonomies in data science education support curriculum development, they often lack the granularity and focus needed to support the assessment and development of DSPS skills. In this paper, we present a novel framework that combines the strengths of large language models (LLMs) and human expertise to identify, define, and organize KCs specific to DSPS. We treat LLMs as ”knowledge engineering assistants” capable of generating candidate KCs by drawing on their extensive training data, which includes a vast amount of domain knowledge and diverse sets of real-world DSPS cases. Our process involves prompting multiple LLMs to generate decision points, synthesizing and refining KC definitions across models, and using sentence-embedding models to infer the underlying structure of the resulting taxonomy. Human experts then review and iteratively refine the taxonomy to ensure validity. This human-AI collaborative workflow offers a scalable and efficient proof-of-concept for LLM-assisted knowledge engineering. The resulting KC taxonomy lays the groundwork for developing fine-grained assessment tools and adaptive learning systems that support deliberate practice in DSPS. Furthermore, the framework illustrates the potential of LLMs not just as content generators but as partners in structuring domain knowledge to inform instructional design. Future work will involve extending the framework by generating a directed graph of KCs based on their input-output dependencies and validating the taxonomy through expert consensus and learner studies. This approach contributes to both the practical advancement of DSPS coaching in data science education and the broader methodological toolkit for AI-supported knowledge engineering.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","341–345","","","","","","","L@S '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Palermo, Italy","","","","large language models; knowledge engineering; data science education; data science problem solving; domain analysis; knowledge components; problem solving","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The purpose of this paper is to discuss the usage of Sanskrit as a source, target, or supporting language in various Machine Translation systems. To investigate Machine Translation, researchers use a variety of strategies, including corpus-based, direct, and rule-based approaches. The primary goal of employing Sanskrit in Machine Translation is to evaluate its appropriateness, lexicon, and performance when proper Machine Translation methods are used. The research examines various modelling strategies for developing a machine translation system, specifically Statistical and Neural Machine Translation, in order to bridge the gap between Sanskrit and its current successor, Hindi. Interpretations are formed in Statistical Machine Translation by matching words from the source and target languages with statistical models and bilingual text corpora to learn parameters. Neural Machine Translation, on the other hand, uses an artificial neural network to predict the likelihood of a word sequence, frequently modelling entire phrases within a single integrated model. Neural Machine Translation is implemented using an encoder-decoder architecture with an attention mechanism. One of the most significant contributions of this paper is the use of different data sources, data collecting, and scraping to create a complete dataset. According to the study's findings, Neural Machine Translation outperforms the Statistical Machine Translation modelling technique. Furthermore, the paper examines the distinctive qualities of the Sanskrit language as well as the difficulties encountered by researchers in digesting Sanskrit while constructing the machine translation system. This study investigates the use of Sanskrit in Machine Translation and analyses several modelling methods, such as Statistical and Neural Machine Translation. The paper emphasizes the advantages of Neural Machine Translation and discusses the unique characteristics and challenges of the Sanskrit language in machine translation development.","2023-07","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural Language Processing (NLP); Bilingual Dictionary; Corpus-Based Machine Translation (CBMT); Interlingua; Parallel Corpora; part of speech (POS); Sanskrit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

NALSpatial consists of two core phases. The natural language understanding phase extracts key entity information, comprehends the query intent and determines the query type. The key entities and query type are passed to the subsequent natural language translation phase, which employs entity mapping rules and structured language models to construct executable database queries accordingly. We implement NALSpatial on the open-source extensible database system SECONDO to support range queries, nearest neighbor queries, spatial joins and aggregation queries. Extensive experiments show that NALSpatial on average achieves response time of about 2.5 seconds, translatability of 95% and translation precision of 92%, outperforming state-of-the-art natural language transformation methods.","2023","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","","","","","","","","SIGSPATIAL '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamburg, Germany","","","","query processing; natural language interface; semantic parsing; spatial database","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In more natural communication, however, human speech is unconstrained, often describing goals (e.g., ""make it cozy in here"" or ""help me save energy"") rather than indicating specific target devices and actions to take on those devices. Current systems fail to understand these under-specified commands since they cannot reason about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We introduce large language models (LLMs) to this problem space, exploring their use for controlling devices and creating automation routines in response to under-specified user commands in smart homes. We empirically study the baseline quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans with a survey of age-diverse users. We find that LLMs can reason creatively to achieve challenging goals, but they experience patterns of failure that diminish their usefulness. We address these gaps with Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to loosely-constrained commands like ""make it cozy"" or ""help me sleep better"" by executing plans to achieve user goals—e.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines.

Ensuring its consistency with the artifacts of an SPL requires co-evolving them alongside the developed system. When performed manually, this co-evolution process is tedious and error-prone, highlighting the need for automated support. Yet, little attention has been given to the automation of co-evolution between and source code. In this paper, we explore the potential of open-source s to fill this gap. Specifically, we investigate the extent to which s can support bidirectional co-evolution: from to source code—where modifications in the drive changes in the code—and from source code to —where updates in the code are reflected back into the. We evaluate our -based approach on a real-world configurable system. Our results demonstrate that co-evolution from source code to achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.93 to 1.0, while co-evolution from to source code achieves F1 scores between 0.41 and 0.99. These findings highlight the potential of s to support this co-evolution process, while also showing limitations and suggesting areas for improvement, particularly for the co-evolution from to code. Additionally, we conduct a comparative study across various s, revealing how choice affects co-evolution and, incidentally, how it affects model and code generation. Up to a certain size limit, larger s tend to produce more accurate and stable outputs than smaller ones, however, this influence is less pronounced in the code generation task. Overall, our work opens a new research avenue where s are leveraged for automating the co-evolution between configurable software systems and variability models.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","27–38","","","","","","","SPLC-A '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Large Language Models; Co-evolution; Software Product Lines; Feature Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Spreadsheet software allows users to automatically format their tables by writing data-dependent conditional formatting (CF) rules. Writing such rules is often challenging for users as it requires understanding and implementing the underlying logic. We present FormaT5, a transformer-based model that can generate a CF rule given the target table and a natural language description of the desired formatting logic. We find that user descriptions for these tasks are often under-specified or ambiguous, making it harder for code generation systems to accurately learn the desired rule in a single step. To tackle this problem of under-specification and minimise argument errors, FormaT5 learns to predict placeholders though an abstention objective. These placeholders can then be filled by a second model or, when examples of rows that should be formatted are available, by a programming-by-example system. To evaluate FormaT5 on diverse and real scenarios, we create an extensive benchmark of 1053 CF tasks, containing real-world descriptions collected from four different sources. We release our benchmarks to encourage research in this area. Abstention and filling allow FormaT5 to outperform 8 different neural approaches on our benchmarks, both with and without examples.

Thus, data curation, dealing with cleaning, organising, and managing data, has become a significant research area to be addressed. Increasingly, semantic data structures such as ontologies and knowledge graphs empower the new generation of AI systems. In this article, we focus on ontologies as a special type of data. Ontologies are conceptual data structures representing a domain of interest and are often used as a backbone to knowledge-based intelligent systems or as an additional input for machine learning algorithms. Low-quality ontologies, containing incorrectly represented information or controversial concepts modelled from a single viewpoint, can lead to invalid application outputs and biased systems. Thus, we focus on the curation of ontologies as a crucial factor for ensuring trust in the enabled AI systems. While some ontology quality aspects can be automatically evaluated, others require a human-in-the-loop evaluation. Yet, despite the importance of the field, several ontology quality aspects have not yet been addressed and there is a lack of guidelines for optimal design of human computation tasks to perform such evaluations. In this article, we advance the state-of-the-art by making two novel contributions. First, we propose a human computation (HC)–based approach for the verification of ontology restrictions —an ontology evaluation aspect that has not yet been addressed with HC techniques. Second, by performing two controlled experiments with a junior expert crowd, we empirically derive task design guidelines for achieving high-quality evaluation results related to (i) the formalism for representing ontology axioms and (ii) crowd qualification testing. We find that the representation format of the ontology does not significantly influence the campaign results. Nevertheless, contributors expressed a preference in working with a graphical ontology representation. Additionally, we show that an objective qualification test is better fitted at assessing contributors’ prior knowledge rather than a subjective self-assessment and that prior modelling knowledge of the contributors had a positive effect on their judgements. We make all artefacts designed and used in the experimental campaign publicly available.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ontology evaluation; human-in-the-loop; human computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ensuring they safely handle harmful inputs is crucial before formal deployment. However, research reveals emerging hand-crafted jailbreak attacks, which pack harmful prompts into harmless instructions, can bypass LLMs’ security mechanisms and elicit harmful responses. To deeply understand such jailbreaks, this paper introduces a Compositional Instruction Attack (CIA) framework to generalize them, and develop two CIA jailbreaking methods to automatically generate tailored jailbreak prompts for each harmful prompt. Then, this paper builds the first CIA question-answering (CIAQA) dataset with 2.7K multiple-choice questions of 900 successful jailbreaks, for assessing LLMs’ ability to identify underlying harmful intents, harmfulness, and task priority in CIA jailbreaks. Combined with experimental analysis on CIAQA and other datasets, this paper concludes three possible reasons for the failure of LLM defenses against CIAs. Finally, we propose an intent-based defense paradigm (IBD), enabling LLMs to defend against CIA by leveraging its capability to identify intents.

It is evident from our research findings that the majority of research on sign language generation was carried out using data-driven approaches in the absence of proper grammar rules and generated only manual signs. This research study may provide researchers a roadmap toward future research directions and facilitate the compilation of information in the field of sign language generation.","2023-04","2025-09-10 14:11:56","2025-09-10 14:11:56","","","","4","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Machine translation; Interlingua; HamNoSys; SiGML; virtual avatar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework includes 168 problems, Verilog reference solutions, Verilog test benches, Python test scripts, and workflow orchestration scripts.

Our results demonstrate the promise of in-context learning when applied to smaller models (e.g., pass rate for CodeGemma 7B improves from 14.9% to 32.7% on Verilog) and Python-embedded DSLs (e.g., pass rate for LLama3 70B improves from 0.6% to 33.0% on PyMTL3). We find LLMs perform better when targeting Verilog as compared to Python-embedded DSLs (e.g., pass rate for GPT4 Turbo is 72.2% on Verilog and 29.8-62.0% on the Python-embedded DSLs) despite using a popular general-purpose host language.

Inspired by the popularity of generating adversarial examples against DNNs in Computer Vision (CV), research efforts on attacking DNNs for Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications have emerged in recent years.

First, most rely on traditional statistical methods, which struggle to capture the complexity of genetic, family medical history, and lifestyle factors. Hence, the accuracy of these models is limited. Additionally, the models neglect to integrate multidimensional data sources, particularly genetic information like single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which could enhance prediction accuracy. Third, while the system might effectively predict risk, it cannot translate those predictions into actionable healthcare recommendations to reduce cancer risk.In this study, we address all three of these limitations.

Manual evaluation of large and complex ontologies is a tedious task. Thus, a few approaches have been proposed for automated evaluation, ranging from concept coverage to ontology generation from a corpus. Existing approaches, however, are limited by their dependence on external structured knowledge sources, such as a thesaurus, as well as by their inability to evaluate semantic relationships. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to automatically evaluate the domain coverage and semantic correctness of existing ontologies based on domain information derived from text. The approach uses a domain-tuned named-entity-recognition model to extract phrasal concepts. The extracted concepts are then used as a representation of the domain against which we evaluate the candidate ontology’s concepts. We further employ a domain-tuned language model to determine the semantic correctness of the candidate ontology’s relations.

The latest query clarification method is knowledge graph (KG)-based, but limitations include out-of-vocabulary (OOV) failures and rigid question templates. To address these limitations, we propose a novel knowledge-guided query clarification approach for API recommendation that leverages a large language model (LLM) guided by KG. We utilize the LLM as a neural knowledge base to overcome OOV failures, generating fluent and appropriate clarification questions and options. We also leverage the structured API knowledge and entity relationships stored in the KG to filter out noise, and transfer the optimal clarification path from KG to the LLM, increasing the efficiency of the clarification process. Our approach is designed as an AI chain that consists of five steps, each handled by a separate LLM call, to improve accuracy, efficiency, and fluency for query clarification in API recommendation. We verify the usefulness of each unit in our AI chain, which all received high scores close to a perfect 5. When compared to the baselines, our approach shows a significant improvement in MRR, with a maximum increase of 63.9% higher when the query statement is covered in KG and 37.2% when it is not.

An important aspect of such automatic information extraction and analysis is the annotation of language data using semantic tagging tools. Different semantic tagging tools have been designed to carry out various levels of semantic analysis, for instance, named entity recognition and disambiguation, sentiment analysis, word sense disambiguation, content analysis, and semantic role labelling. Common to all of these tasks, in the supervised setting, is the requirement for a manually semantically annotated corpus, which acts as a knowledge base from which to train and test potential word and phrase-level sense annotations. Many benchmark corpora have been developed for various semantic tagging tasks, but most are for English and other European languages. There is a dearth of semantically annotated corpora for the Urdu language, which is widely spoken and used around the world. To fill this gap, this study presents a large benchmark corpus and methods for the semantic tagging task for the Urdu language. The proposed corpus contains 8,000 tokens in the following domains or genres: news, social media, Wikipedia, and historical text (each domain having 2K tokens). The corpus has been manually annotated with 21 major semantic fields and 232 sub-fields with the USAS (UCREL Semantic Analysis System) semantic taxonomy which provides a comprehensive set of semantic fields for coarse-grained annotation. Each word in our proposed corpus has been annotated with at least one and up to nine semantic field tags to provide a detailed semantic analysis of the language data, which allowed us to treat the problem of semantic tagging as a supervised multi-target classification task. To demonstrate how our proposed corpus can be used for the development and evaluation of Urdu semantic tagging methods, we extracted local, topical and semantic features from the proposed corpus and applied seven different supervised multi-target classifiers to them. Results show an accuracy of 94% on our proposed corpus which is free and publicly available to download.","2023-06","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","semantic annotation; multi-target classifiers; semantic tagger; Urdu corpus annotation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, the design of these systems requires different engineering domains, e.g., the mechanical, electrical, and control domains, to work together. The different domains often work in parallel to gain efficiency in this so-called co-design process. However, the design choices made by engineers in one domain can influence parameters in another domain. Too little or even no knowledge about these cross-domain influences may later lead to system integration problems or to degraded system performance. Solving these problems requires taking steps back in the development process, causing a higher design cost. In order to improve this cross-domain collaboration, we propose using ontologies to assist the co-design process by explicitly capturing the design dependencies, both within and across the engineering domains. However, designing ontologies can be complex and is labor-intensive, especially if one relies on generic ontology languages like the Web Ontology Language 2 (OWL 2). Therefore, we created a Domain Specific Language (DSL) focusing on the essential complexity, which enables engineers to design a cross-domain system ontology in a consistent and straightforward way. We elaborate on the metamodel for this DSL, discuss the realization of a prototype tool, and demonstrate how one can then reason on this ontology to derive new information about the various cross-domain design relationships.","2022","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","633–642","","","","","","","MODELS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","ontology; metamodel; domain-specific language; co-design; mechatronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The eFLINT interpreter has been used to automate the analysis of real-time or historical cases by computing logical consequences and reporting normative violations. To support future language and tooling developments, we contribute a formal definition of the language as a translation to first-order logic programming with stable model semantics. The described semantics aligns with the previous semi-formal descriptions of the language, but resolves issues relating to logical inference with negative antecedent and aggregation operators. Specifically, we formalise the connection between eFLINT's derivation rules and Horn clauses under the stable model semantics. Secondly, by repurposing the Clingo answer-set solver as a highly-optimised eFLINT interpreter, we extend the toolset for eFLINT with model-checking abstract properties in addition to case analysis. We evaluate the new semantics and interpreter via an empirical comparison of the existing implementation to our prototype implementation.

I dive here deep into the biological and bio-semiotic underpinnings of patterning and languaging, seeking to make a clear distinction between them. I explore the nature and ""timeless properties"" of patterns as signs and their role in the emergence of human cognition and language from an evolutionary perspective. In particular I examine their involvement in 'habit taking' and in the coordination of unselfconscious action and creative processes, such as evoked by Christopher Alexander.This paper does not provide solutions or answers, it sets a foundation to show how the development of a pattern literacy around patterns seen as basic units for the coordination of action and the understanding of the world, beyond domain knowledge and linguistic divides, could bring new possibilities for the study and orientation of socio-ecological and socio-technological systems. This will open up opportunities to further explore how pattern languages could be understood and applied towards this objective, in order to actually realize their potential as lingua franca.","2022","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","","","","","","PLoP '20","","","","The Hillside Group","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event","","","","action research; complex systems; semiotics; boundary objects; complex adaptive modeling; participatory inquiry; pattern language; pattern literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For common domains and named entities such as places and organisations, there exists sufficient high quality annotated data and foundational models such as T5 and GPT-3.5 also provide highly accurate predictions. However, for niche domains such as e-commerce and medicine with specialized entity types, there is a paucity of labeled data since manual labeling of tokens is often time-consuming and expensive, which makes entity recognition challenging for such domains. Recent works such as NEEDLE [48] propose hybrid solutions to efficiently combine a small amount of strongly labeled (human-annotated) with a large amount of weakly labeled (distant supervision) data to yield superior performance relative to supervised training.

However, existing research typically takes a silo-ed view of solving a certain task in incident management by leveraging data from a single stage of the SDLC. In this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting additional contextual data from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance of two critically important and practically challenging tasks: (1) automatically generating root cause recommendations for dependency failure related incidents, and (2) identifying the ontology of service monitors used for automatically detecting incidents. By leveraging a dataset of 353 incidents and 260 monitors from Microsoft, we demonstrate that augmenting contextual information from different stages of the SDLC improves the performance over state-of-the-art methods.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","417–428","","","","","","","FSE 2024","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Porto de Galinhas, Brazil","","","","Large language models; Reliability; Cloud Services; Monitor management; Root-cause analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Compared to specific protein recognition or classification tasks, such as enzyme reaction classification and gene ontology term prediction, protein captioning provides comprehensive textural descriptions for proteins, thus playing a key role in bridging the gap between protein sequences and natural languages. To address the problem, we propose a simple yet effective method, Protein-to-Text Generative Pre-trained Transformer (P2T-GPT), to fuse multimodal embeddings and translate the chain of amino acid residues in a protein to a sequence of natural language words, i.e., text. For the evaluation of protein captioning, we collect the ProteinCap dataset that contains 94,454 protein-text pairs. Experiments on ProteinCap demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed P2T-GPT on protein captioning. For example, our method obtains improvements of 8.74, 10.03, and 11.05 in the BERTScore compared to the baseline model on ProteinCap- (alpha,beta,gamma) , respectively. As minor contributions, first, P2T-GPT provides a way to connect protein science and Large Language Models (LLMs). By appending ChatGPT, our method can interact in a conversational way to answer questions given a protein. Second, we show that protein captioning can be treated as a pre-trained task that can benefit a range of downstream tasks, to a certain extent.","2024-11","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural language processing; Multimodal learning; Protein captioning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably, the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide more semantically meaningful explanations through path-based evidence.","2025-09","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","2818–2830","","9","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automated enforcement and measurability mechanisms for these CSCs still need to be developed. Analyzing the implementations of security products to validate security control enforcement is non-trivial. Moreover, manually analyzing and developing measures and metrics to monitor, and implementing those monitoring mechanisms are resource-intensive tasks and massively dependent on the security analyst's expertise and knowledge. To tackle those problems, we use large language models (LLMs) as a knowledge base and reasoner to extract measures, metrics, and monitoring mechanism implementation steps from security control descriptions to reduce the dependency on security analysts. Our approach used few-shot learning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to generate measures and metrics and generated knowledge prompting for metrics implementation.

In such simulations, the steps taken by an attacker in order to compromise sensitive system assets are traced, and a time estimate may be computed from the initial step to the compromise of assets of interest. Attack graphs constitute a suitable formalism for the modeling of attack steps and their dependencies, allowing the subsequent simulation.To avoid the costly proposition of building new attack graphs for each system of a given type, domain-specific attack languages may be used. These languages codify the generic attack logic of the considered domain, thus facilitating the modeling, or instantiation, of a specific system in the domain. Examples of possible cyber security domains suitable for domain-specific attack languages are generic types such as cloud systems or embedded systems but may also be highly specialized kinds, e.g. Ubuntu installations; the objects of interest as well as the attack logic will differ significantly between such domains.In this paper, we present the Meta Attack Language (MAL), which may be used to design domain-specific attack languages such as the aforementioned. The MAL provides a formalism that allows the semi-automated generation as well as the efficient computation of very large attack graphs. We declare the formal background to MAL, define its syntax and semantics, exemplify its use with a small domain-specific language and instance model, and report on the computational performance.","2018","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","","","","","","ARES '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamburg, Germany","","","","Cyber Security; Domain Specific Language; Threat Modeling; Attack Graphs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Current state-of-the-art models for ED primarily focus on identifying a limited set of predefined event types. Recently, the challenge of detecting a broad array of predefined event types has garnered increasing interest within the IE community. However, a significant gap in existing research on ED with extensive ontologies is the inadequate exploration of how interactions between event types affect ED model performance. One of the hindrances for this purpose is the lack of resources to encode event-event dependencies for large ontologies. This study introduces a novel approach that leverages existing inter-event dependency resources to provide this information for extensive ontologies. Specifically, a solution based on Optimal Transport is proposed to map event-event dependency from existing resources to a large ontology. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets to assess the effectiveness of our approach. Our findings, supported by a thorough analysis, demonstrate that this innovative technique significantly enhances the performance of ED models, especially for ontologies with a large number of event types.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","3612–3616","","","","","","","CIKM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boise, ID, USA","","","","optimal transport; event detection; large ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is concerned with the specific problem of finding and ranking relations from a given Knowledge Graph (KG) that hold over pairs of entities juxtaposed in a table or structured list. The state-of-the-art for this task is to attempt to link the entities mentioned in the table cells to objects in the KG and rank the relations that hold for those linked objects. As a result, these methods are hampered by the incompleteness and uneven coverage in even the best knowledge graphs available today. The alternative described here does not require entity linking, relying instead on ranking relations using generative language models derived from Web-scale corpora. As such, it can produce quality results even when the entities in the table are missing in the KG. The experimental validation, designed to expose the challenges posed by KG incompleteness, shows that our approach is robust and effective in practice.","2018","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","1307–1316","","","","","","","WWW '18","","","","International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","","","","","","","","event-place: Lyon, France","","","","knowledge graphs; generative language models; web table understanding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These data must be structured and normalized before integration to improve the search and increase the relevance of results. An ontology can address this critical task by efficiently managing data and providing structured formats through techniques such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). However, building an ontology can be costly, primarily if conducted manually. In this context, we propose a new methodology for automatically building and learning a multilingual ontology using Arabic as the base language via a corpus collected from Wikipedia. Our proposed methodology relies on Finite-state transducers (FSTs). FSTs are regrouped into a cascade to reduce errors and minimize ambiguity. The produced ontology is extended to English and French and independent language images via a translator we developed using APIs. The rationale for starting with the Arabic corpus to extract terms is that entity linking is more convenient from Arabic to other languages. In addition, many Wikipedia articles in English and French (for instance) do not have associated Arabic articles, but the opposite is true. In addition, dealing with Arabic terms permits us to enrich the Arabic module of the free linguistic platform we use in dictionaries and graphs. To assess the efficiency of our proposed methodology, we conducted performance metrics. The reported results are encouraging and promising.","2023-11","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","11","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Arabic NLP; API; finite sate transducer; Ontology building and learning; transducer cascade","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore potential bias in sentiment analysis tools in the context of Bengali communities who have experienced and continue to experience the impacts of colonialism. Drawing on identity categories most impacted by colonialism amongst local Bengali communities, we focused our analytic attention on gender, religion, and nationality. We conducted an algorithmic audit of all sentiment analysis tools for Bengali, available on the Python package index (PyPI) and GitHub. Despite similar semantic content and structure, our analyses showed that in addition to inconsistencies in output from different tools, Bengali sentiment analysis tools exhibit bias between different identity categories and respond differently to different ways of identity expression.

At SLE2023, Pasquier et al. presented a generic framework that makes exploration practical through user-defined reductions on program states and by proposing expressive logics for defining and searching for states and traces of interest, generalising the concept of breakpoint. The framework has been validated through the case study language AnimUML designed to make non-deterministic UML specifications executable.In this paper, we perform additional case studies to evaluate the applicability of the framework. We analyse three non-deterministic, domain-specific languages representing three different domains: grammar engineering, formal operational semantics, and norm engineering. The framework is evaluated against requirements extracted from these domains, resulting in the identification of several limitations of the framework.

This article focuses on semantic modeling of WoT and proposes a new approach called Decomposition for Ontology Matching (DOM) to discover relevant knowledge by exploring correlations between WoT data using decomposition strategies. The DOM technique adopts several decomposition techniques to order highly linked ontologies of WoT data into similar groups. The main idea is to decompose the instances of each ontology into similar groups and then match instances of similar groups instead of entire instances of two ontologies. Three main algorithms for decomposition have been developed. The first algorithm is based on radar scanning, which determines the distribution of distances between each instance and all other instances to determine the cluster centroid. The second algorithm is based on adaptive grid clustering, where it focuses on distribution information and the construction of spanning trees. The third algorithm is based on split index clustering, where instances are divided into groups of cells from which noise is removed during the merging process. Several studies were conducted with different ontology databases to illustrate the use of the DOM technique. The results show that DOM outperforms state-of-the-art ontology matching models in terms of computational cost while maintaining the quality of the matching. Moreover, these results demonstrate that DOM is capable of handling various large datasets in WoT contexts.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:11:57","2025-09-10 14:11:57","","","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ontology matching; Web of Things; decomposition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Addressing these issues is one of the key drivers of food sharing initiatives (FSIs) which focus on collective acts around food across the food system. FSIs range from seed sharing and surplus food redistribution to community composting. We describe our development and deployment of web retrieval and content classification tools designed to provide automated mapping of FSIs at scale to populate databases of FSIs within cities. We present our novel automated system tailored for retrieving, identifying, categorizing and real-time monitoring of FSIs in over 200 European cities. Developed within the European CULTIVATE project, this system not only aids in comprehending the complex dynamics of the food sharing economy, but also enhances its visibility and operational efficiency. The automation of these processes plays a vital role in supporting the goals of the CULTIVATE project, notably in promoting sustainable food practices and resilient local food networks. Our system integrates web search using queries constructed automatically using domain-specific vocabulary resources with Large Language Model (LLM) query writing and classification methods. Experimental results using a collection of data derived from real online FSI content underscore the potential of digital automation to make significant contributions to innovative digital solutions to contemporary sustainability challenges.

However, query-document term mismatch in sparse retrieval persists, rendering it infeasible for many practical applications. Recent research has shown that Large Language Models (LLMs) hold relevant information that can enhance sparse retrieval through the application of prompt engineering. In this paper, we build upon this concept to explore various strategies employing LLMs for information retrieval purposes. Specifically, we utilize LLMs to enhance sparse retrieval by query rewriting and query expansion. In query rewriting, the original query is refined by creating several new queries. For query expansion, LLMs are employed to generate extra terms, thereby enriching the original query. We conduct experiments on a range of well-known information retrieval datasets, including MSMARCO-passage, TREC2019, TREC2020, Natural Questions, SCIFACT. The experiments show that LLMs can be beneficial for sparse methods since the added information provided by the LLMs can help diminish the discrepancy between the term frequencies of the important terms in a query and the relevant document. In certain domains, we demonstrate that the effectiveness of LLMs is constrained, indicating that they may not consistently perform optimally, which will be explored in future research.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","1609–1615","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","large language models; information retrieval; query expansion; query writing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The reason is that, unlike description logics, tgds can easily handle higher-arity relations that naturally occur in relational databases. In recent years, there has been an extensive study of tgd-ontologies and of their applications to several different data-intensive tasks. However, the fundamental question of whether the expressive power of tgd-ontologies can be characterized in terms of model-theoretic properties remains largely unexplored. We establish several characterizations of tgd-ontologies, including characterizations of ontologies specified by such central classes of tgds as full, linear, guarded, and frontier-guarded tgds. Our characterizations use the well-known notions of critical instance and direct product, as well as a novel locality property for tgd-ontologies. We further use this locality property to decide whether an ontology expressed by frontier-guarded (respectively, guarded) tgds can be expressed by tgds in the weaker class of guarded (respectively, linear) tgds, and effectively construct such an equivalent ontology if one exists.","2021","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","416–428","","","","","","","PODS'21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, China","","","","ontologies; finite axiomatizability; guardedness; model theory; tuple-generating dependencies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by this, we design a natural language interface for moving objects, named NALMO. In general, we use semantic parsing in combination with a location knowledge base and domain-specific rules to interpret natural language queries. We design a corpus of moving objects queries for model training, which is later used to determine the query type.

As organizations handle growing amounts of data, robust defense strategies depend on comprehensive datasets for detecting and preventing threats. This paper addresses data scarcity in cybersecurity by proposing the development of a dataset ontology tailored to the domain. In data science, ontologies are structured frameworks that define relationships between different concepts within a specific field. A dataset ontology for cybersecurity serves as a cohesive framework for categorizing, organizing, and interconnecting datasets, making it easier for professionals to access and analyze threat-relevant data. The objective is to fill the gap in existing datasets and enable more precise, data-driven cybersecurity strategies. Every cyber-attack generates data, such as network logs, malware metadata, or phishing records. Professionals use this data to analyze threats, understand attack methods, and devise preventive strategies.AI models rely on large volumes of high-quality data to train algorithms, using historical patterns to detect real-time threats and respond before significant damage occurs. Unfortunately, the lack of structured and comprehensive datasets [2] in cybersecurity presents a significant challenge to building these AI models. The data generated by cyber-attacks is often fragmented, inconsistent, or incomplete, making it difficult to develop accurate threat detection systems. Without access to well-organized datasets, AI models are less effective, prone to producing false positives, and unable to adapt to new types of attacks [3]. As a result, cybersecurity defenses are weakened, leaving organizations vulnerable to increasingly sophisticated threats. The dataset ontology proposed in this paper seeks to address the challenge of data scarcity by providing a structured framework for organizing cybersecurity datasets. By categorizing and systematizing data related to various types of cyber-attacks, this ontology facilitates a more comprehensive and detailed understanding of the threat landscape. In the case of cybersecurity, the ontology organizes data based on categories such as attack types, threat actors, vulnerabilities, and attack methods.This proposed well-designed dataset ontology offers several key benefits. First, it makes it easier to identify gaps in existing datasets and create new, targeted datasets that capture the intricacies of real-world cyber-attacks. These datasets can then be used to train AI models, ensuring that they are better equipped to detect and respond to emerging threats. Second, this ontology establishes relationships between different types of cyber-attacks, providing a more holistic view of how these attacks are interconnected. For example, it can link phishing attacks to ransomware infections, allowing AI models to recognize patterns that may otherwise go unnoticed. The ontology-driven approach is particularly valuable because it enables continuous updates and improvements to cybersecurity datasets. As cyber threats evolve, so must the data used to train AI models. A dataset ontology provides the flexibility needed to incorporate new data as it becomes available, ensuring that cybersecurity models remain relevant and effective in the face of changing attack patterns.The research involved the creation of a preliminary draft taxonomy followed by the categorization and classification of the taxonomy into distinct clusters, representing different facets within the realm of cybersecurity. The dataset ontology introduced in this paper offers a solution by ensuring that AI models have access to well-organized, comprehensive datasets that reflect the full spectrum of cyber threats. By systematically categorizing different types of cyber-attacks and the data associated with them, the ontology provides AI models with the information they need to detect both common and emerging threats. This, in turn, enhances the accuracy and reliability of these models, enabling them to detect real-time cyber-attacks with greater precision and fewer false positives.Moreover, the ontology-driven approach ensures that AI models remain adaptable in the face of evolving threats [4]. Cyber-attacks are not static; they continuously evolve as malicious actors develop new techniques to bypass existing defenses. Without access to updated datasets, AI models may become outdated and ineffective. The dataset ontology addresses this issue by allowing for continuous updates to the data used in training, ensuring that AI models remain agile and responsive to new challenges. The practical applications of the proposed dataset ontology extend beyond the realm of theoretical research. By providing a structured and comprehensive framework for organizing cybersecurity data, the ontology enables organizations to develop more effective defense strategies and respond more quickly to emerging threats. For instance, organizations can use dataset ontology to create AI models capable of detecting insider threats, which are particularly difficult to identify due to the complexity of monitoring behavior [5] within trusted environments. These models can also be used to detect zero-day vulnerabilities, which are exploited by attackers before security teams have the chance to patch them.Additionally, dataset ontology facilitates collaboration across the cybersecurity industry by providing a common framework for sharing data. Currently, many organizations struggle to share cybersecurity data due to the lack of standardized formats and structures. The proposed ontology provides a solution to this issue by offering a standardized framework that can be adopted across the industry, making it easier for organizations to collaborate and share data in a meaningful way.In conclusion, the creation of dataset ontology represents a significant advancement in the field of cybersecurity. By addressing the problem of data scarcity and fragmentation [5], the ontology provides a structured framework for organizing and interconnecting diverse datasets, allowing for more effective data analysis and threat detection. This ontology-driven approach enhances the accuracy and adaptability of AI models, enabling them to detect and neutralize cyber threats in real time. Furthermore, the practical applications of dataset ontology extend beyond academic research, empowering organizations to protect their data, infrastructure, and services from a wide range of cyber-attacks.As cyber threats continue to evolve, the need for structured and comprehensive datasets will only grow. The dataset ontology provides a much-needed solution to this challenge, ensuring that AI models remain effective in detecting and responding to new and emerging threats.

Large language models (LLMs) offer strong potential for processing such data but struggle with factual accuracy and provenance. Knowledge graphs (KGs) provide a structured framework to address these limitations [6], yet constructing high-quality KGs from heterogeneous data remains a challenge. To address this issue, we present Docs2KG, a modular framework to build high-quality KGs from diverse unstructured documents. We first employs state-of-the-art document processing techniques to extract textual content, tabular data, and figures. The extracted information is then unified into a multifaceted KG with three aspects: (1) a Layout KG capturing document structural hierarchies, (2) a Metadata KG preserving document properties, and (3) a Semantic KG representing domain-specific entities and relationships. Docs2KG supports multiple construction paradigms for Semantic KG: ontology-based approaches, hybrid NLP pipelines with LLM verification, LLM-guided ontology generation, and specialized models for named entity recognition, event extraction, and causal relationship identification to enhance semantic coverage and accuracy. A key feature of Docs2KG is its human-in-the-loop verification interface, enabling iterative quality assessment and refinement of the resulting KGs.

This article makes multifold contributions. First, we discuss the various stemmers of 15 Indian and 17 non-Indian languages describing their key points, benefits, and drawbacks. All the Indian languages for which stemmers have been built are covered in this study. For the non-Indian languages, stemmers of commonly spoken languages have been covered.

Developed by conceptualizing authoritative knowledge and notions taken from Panofsky’s levels of interpretation theory, ICON ontology focuses on the granularity of interpretations. It can be used to describe an interpretation of an artwork from the pre-iconographical, icongraphical, and iconological levels. Its main classes have been aligned to ontologies that come from the domains of cultural descriptions (ArCo, CIDOC-CRM, VIR), semiotics (DOLCE), bibliometrics (CITO), and symbolism (Simulation Ontology), to grant a robust schema that can be extendable using additional classes and properties coming from these ontologies. The ontology was evaluated through competency questions that range from simple recognition on a specific level of interpretation to complex scenarios. Data written using this model was compared to state-of-the-art ontologies and schemas to both highlight the current lack of a domain-specific ontology on art interpretation and show how our work fills some of the current gaps. The ontology is openly available and compliant with FAIR principles. With our ontology, we hope to encourage digital art historians working for cultural institutions in making more detailed linked open data about the content of their artifacts, to exploit the full potential of Semantic Web in linking artworks through not only subjects and common metadata but also specific symbolic interpretations, intrinsic meanings, and the motifs through which their subjects are represented.

These models learn to extract logical paths between learners and resources to be recommended within the knowledge graph, according to behavior- and content-based patterns. Extracted paths are then used not only to provide recommendations, but also to generate accompanying textual explanations. Despite the potential of this approach, current ontologies derived from the traditional learner-resource interaction data fall short in terms of richness from an educational perspective. Conversely, general-purpose ontologies, while comprehensive in educational aspects, are overly complex for recommendation tasks. Unfortunately, a suboptimal ontology might prevent to articulate reasoning paths, and thus explanations, relevant for learners within the knowledge graph. To counter this limitation, in this paper, we propose LOXER, a novel ontology designed to unlock learner-centered logical paths for explainable educational recommendation. Our design integrates insights from diverse sources, including feedback from a local co-design group of learners, observations from specialized traditional large-scale educational recommendation datasets, and connections with well-known vocabularies of other existing ontologies. To validate our ontology, we conducted an evaluation of the explanation types it enables, involving university and lifelong learners and assessing explanation properties like effectiveness, decision-making speed, motivation, satisfaction, and confidence. Results show our ontology’s ability to foster diverse considerations during the learners’ decision-making process and to establish a semantic structure for knowledge graphs for explainable recommendation.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","567–575","","","","","","","UMAP Adjunct '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cagliari, Italy","","","","Ontology; Recommendation; Explainability.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach requires such regulatory services to be closely aligned with a formal description of the relevant norms. This paper presents eFLINT, a domain-specific language developed for formalizing norms. The theoretical foundations of the language are found in transition systems and in Hohfeld's framework of legal fundamental conceptions. The language can be used to formalize norms from a large variety of sources. The resulting specifications are executable and support several forms of reasoning such as automatic case assessment, manual exploration and simulation. Moreover, the specifications can be used to develop regulatory services for several types of monitoring, control and enforcement. The language is evaluated through a case study formalizing articles 6(1)(a) and 16 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).

To support a suitable analysis across multiple domains, it is necessary having a unified data model able to handle the inherent heterogeneity of smart city data and take into account both geographic and citizen information.

In this paper we propose a language whose expressive power goes beyond that of DL-Lite while still allowing query answering via rewriting of queries into unions of conjunctive two-way regular path queries (UC2RPQs) instead of SQL queries. Our language is an extension of both OWL 2 QL and linear ELH: OWL 2 QL is extended by allowing qualified existential quantification on the left-hand side of concept inclusion axioms, and linear ELH by allowing inverses in role inclusion axioms. We identify a syntactic property of the extended language that guarantees UC2RPQ-rewritability. We propose a novel rewriting technique for conjunctive queries (CQs) under our ontology language that makes use of nondeterministic finite state automata. We show that CQ answering in our setting is NLOGSPACE-complete with respect to data complexity and NP-complete for combined complexity; we also show that answering instance queries is NLOGSPACE-complete for data complexity and in PTIME for combined complexity.","2025-04","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","","","","82","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: El Segundo, CA, USA Publisher: AI Access Foundation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main aim of code retrieval is to search for the most relevant snippet from a corpus of code snippets. However, code retrieval frameworks for low-resource languages are insufficient. Retrieving the most relevant code snippet efficiently can be accomplished only by eliminating the semantic gap between the code snippets residing in the repository and the user’s query (natural language description). The primary objective of the research is to contribute to this field by providing a code search framework that can be extended for low-resource languages. The secondary objective is to provide a code retrieval mechanism that is semantically relevant to the user query and provide programmers with the ability to locate source code that they want to use when developing new applications. The proposed approach is implemented using a web platform to search for source code. As code retrieval is a sophisticated task, the proposed approach incorporates a semantic search mechanism. This research uses a semantic model for code retrieval, which generates meanings or synonyms of words. The proposed model integrates ontologies and Natural Language Processing. System performance measures and classification accuracy are computed using precision, recall, and F1-score. We also compare the proposed approach with state-of-the-art baseline models. The retrieved results are ranked, showing that our approach significantly outperforms robust code matching. Our evaluation shows that semantic matching leads to improved source code retrieval.

Immersive technologies provide users with immersive experiences. Assessing and modeling the quality of such experiences has become a trending topic in HCI, and UX is a key quality attribute in this context. When it comes to immersive experiences, evaluating UX is particularly challenging because the user should not be interrupted to provide feedback. In this paper, we propose using networked ontologies to support evaluating immersive experiences. We have explored using ontologies from an ontology network addressing the HCI domain to develop a tool that supports UX experts evaluating such experiences based on data recorded in interaction logs. We used the ontology-based tool to evaluate the UX of an immersive application that supports collaborative music composition. The tool extracted data from the application interaction logs applied UX metrics, and provided consolidated data and information in graphs and tables. We conducted a study and collected feedback from the tool developer and three UX experts who used the tool. Results showed that using networked ontologies to develop a tool to support UX evaluation is feasible and valuable. In summary, the ontologies helped at the conceptual level by offering a basis to define the system’s structural model and at the implementation level by assigning semantics to data to make inferences about UX. Based on the UX experts’ perceptions, the tool was considered a promising system, beneficial, helpful, and easy to use.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","","","","","","","","IHC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Maceió, Brazil","","","","Ontology; Immersive Experience; Ontology Network; User Experience; UX Evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing models, which utilize clinical notes and multivariate time-series EHR data, often fall short of incorporating the necessary medical context for accurate clinical tasks, while previous approaches with knowledge graphs (KGs) primarily focus on structured knowledge extraction. In response, we propose EMERGE, a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) driven framework to enhance multimodal EHR predictive modeling. We extract entities from both time-series data and clinical notes by prompting Large Language Models (LLMs) and align them with professional PrimeKG, ensuring consistency. In addition to triplet relationships, we incorporate entities' definitions and descriptions for richer semantics. The extracted knowledge is then used to generate task-relevant summaries of patients' health statuses. Finally, we fuse the summary with other modalities using an adaptive multimodal fusion network with cross-attention. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV datasets' in-hospital mortality and 30-day readmission tasks demonstrate the superior performance of the EMERGE framework over baseline models. Comprehensive ablation studies and analysis highlight the efficacy of each designed module and robustness to data sparsity.

To perform automated tasks, service robots are not only required to recognize various attributes of the service environment, but they must also determine, which tasks and behaviors to perform, according to their internal system specifications and those of the individual situation. To perform tasks in such a generalized manner efficiently, the service robot must abstractly understand the recognition data obtained from the external environment and plan its tasks by combining the data and existing knowledge. Thus, an abstract and integrated knowledge management of low-level external recognition data and symbolic-level knowledge is indispensable. This study proposes a knowledge model for an integrated robot framework, which is used to provide human-robot interactive services. Our knowledge model is based on an ontology that contains general knowledge which provides clear definitions of common concepts and domain knowledge which provides specific concepts required to understand the information about agents(users and robots), and the environments about human-robot interactive services.

This article reports on a mapping study that surveys the landscape of NLP4RE research to provide a holistic understanding of the field. Following the guidance of systematic review, the mapping study is directed by five research questions, cutting across five aspects of NLP4RE research, concerning the state of the literature, the state of empirical research, the research focus, the state of tool development, and the usage of NLP technologies. Our main results are as follows: (i) we identify a total of 404 primary studies relevant to NLP4RE, which were published over the past 36 years and from 170 different venues; (ii) most of these studies (67.08%) are solution proposals, assessed by a laboratory experiment or an example application, while only a small percentage (7%) are assessed in industrial settings; (iii) a large proportion of the studies (42.70%) focus on the requirements analysis phase, with quality defect detection as their central task and requirements specification as their commonly processed document type; (iv) 130 NLP4RE tools (i.e., RE specific NLP tools) are extracted from these studies, but only 17 of them (13.08%) are available for download; (v) 231 different NLP technologies are also identified, comprising 140 NLP techniques, 66 NLP tools, and 25 NLP resources, but most of them—particularly those novel NLP techniques and specialized tools—are used infrequently; by contrast, commonly used NLP technologies are traditional analysis techniques (e.g., POS tagging and tokenization), general-purpose tools (e.g., Stanford CoreNLP and GATE) and generic language lexicons (WordNet and British National Corpus).

Hence, estimating the impact of a change ex-ante is highly important, as it might make ontology engineers aware of the consequences of their action during editing. However, in order to estimate the impact of changes, we need to understand how to measure them. To address this gap for embeddings, we propose a new measure called Embedding Resemblance Indicator (ERI), which takes into account both the stochasticity of learning embeddings as well as the shortcomings of established comparison methods. We base ERI on (i) a similarity score, (ii) a robustness factor hatμ (based on the embedding method, similarity measure, and dataset), and (iii) the number of added or deleted entities to the embedding computed with the Jaccard index.To evaluate ERI, we investigate its usage in the context of two biomedical ontologies and three embedding methods—GraRep, LINE, and DeepWalk—as well as the two standard benchmark datasets—FB15k-237 and Wordnet-18-RR—with TransE and RESCAL embeddings. To study different aspects of ERI, we introduce synthetic changes in the knowledge graphs, generating two test-cases with five versions each and compare their impact with the expected behaviour. Our studies suggests that ERI behaves as expected and captures the similarity of embeddings based on the severity of changes. ERI is crucial for enabling further studies into impact of changes on embeddings.","2021","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","177–184","","","","","","","K-CAP '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","embedding similarity; knowledge graph embeddings; ontology evolution","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These include centering marginalized perspectives, expanding participatory data governance models, and reimagining urban infrastructure as multi-species sensing apparatuses.

Knowledge representations support Information Retrieval tasks such as searching for single statements, documents, or metadata. Requirements specifications of complex systems such as automotive software systems are usually divided into different subsystem specifications. Nevertheless, there are semantic relations between individual documents of the separated subsystems, which have to be considered in further processes (e.g. dependencies). If requirements engineers or other developers are not aware of these relations, this can lead to inconsistencies or malfunctions of the overall system. Therefore, there is a strong need for tool support in order to detects semantic relations in a set of large natural language requirements specifications. In this work we present a knowledge extraction approach based on an explicit knowledge representation of the content of natural language requirements as a semantic relation graph. Our approach is fully automated and includes an NLP pipeline to transform unrestricted natural language requirements into a graph. We split the natural language into different parts and relate them to each other based on their semantic relation. In addition to semantic relations, other relationships can also be included in the graph.

NER helps in overcoming this problem by recognizing and handling such entities separately, although it can be useful in Information Extraction systems also. Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi are low resource languages, usually known as Purvanchal languages. This article focuses on the development of an NER benchmark dataset for Machine Translation systems developed to translate from these languages to Hindi by annotating parts of the available corpora with named entities. Bhojpuri, Maithili, and Magahi corpora of sizes 228,373, 157,468, and 56,190 tokens, respectively, were annotated using 22 entity labels. The annotation considers coarse-grained annotation labels followed by the tagset used in one of the Hindi NER datasets. We also report a Deep Learning baseline that uses an LSTM-CNNs-CRF model. The lower baseline F1-scores from the NER tool obtained by using Conditional Random Fields models are 70.56% for Bhojpuri, 73.19% for Maithili, and 84.18% for Magahi. The Deep Learning-based technique (LSTM-CNNs-CRF) achieved 61.41% for Bhojpuri, 71.38% for Maithili, and 86.39% for Magahi.

In addition to that, in this paper, we introduce a novel data set which is annotated with legal party information by an expert in the legal domain. The deep learning model proposed in this study provides a benchmark for the legal party identification task on this data set. Evaluations for the solution presented in the paper show that our system has 90.89% precision and 91.69% recall for an unseen paragraph from a legal document, thus conforming the success of our attempt.","2022","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","259–266","","","","","","","iiWAS2021","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Linz, Austria","","","","NER; coreference resolution; Legal party identification; Recurrent Neural Networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This new ontology, known as a uniform interpolant, will only consist of the ”relevant names”, yet it will retain their original meanings. UI is immensely promising due to its applicability across various domains where custom views of ontologies are essential. Nonetheless, to unlock its full potential, we need optimized techniques to generate these tailored views. Previous studies suggest that creating uniform interpolants for EL-ontologies is notably challenging. In some instances, it is not even feasible to compute a uniform interpolant; when feasible, the size of the uniform interpolant can be up to triple exponentially larger than the source ontology. Despite these challenges, our paper introduces an improved ”forgetting” technique specifically designed for computing uniform interpolants of ELI-ontologies. We demonstrate that, with good normalization and inference strategies, such uniform interpolants can be efficiently computed, just as quickly as computing ”modules”. A comprehensive evaluation with a prototypical implementation of the method shows superb success rates over two popular benchmark datasets, demonstrating a clear computational advantage over state-of-the-art approaches.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","1945–1953","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","ontology; module extraction; forgetting; uniform interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing knowledge bases often lack completeness, posing a challenge in sourcing pertinent information. We present MedProm, a novel generative model tailored for medical dialogue generation to address this gap. Motivated by the need for comprehensive and contextually relevant responses, MedProm leverages state-of-the-art language models such as BioGPT. Our model is designed to integrate extensive medical knowledge into conversations, facilitating effective communication between patients and healthcare providers. At the core of MedProm lies the MediConnect Graph, a meticulously constructed knowledge graph capturing intricate relationships among medical entities extracted from dialogue contexts. By employing a KnowFusion encoder with a pretraining objective and masked multi-head self-attention, MedProm effectively processes the MediConnect graph, enabling precise control over information flow to capture its underlying structure. Furthermore, MedProm incorporates a sophisticated Curriculum Knowledge Decoder, leveraging transformer-based decoding to generate response utterances conditioned on input representations from the KnowFusion Encoder. The training process is guided through curriculum learning, gradually increasing optimization difficulty based on a coherence-based criterion. Experimental results on two datasets demonstrate the efficacy of MedProm in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses compared to state-of-the-art models.","2025-01","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Curriculum Knowledge Decoder; Generative Neural Model; KnowFusion Encoder; Medical Dialogue Systems (MDS); MediConnect Graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ASOTVAS project aims to apply AI and data semantics algorithms to the Valencia Anchor Station’s control zone (10 km x 10 km). A data semantics analysis explores concepts such as vocabularies, ontologies, and knowledge maps, with an emphasis on the reuse of existing models. Crucially, an ontological model with clear data definitions is developed to correlate Copernicus Program data with station parameters (e.g., FAPAR, LST, soil moisture, etc.). Using the ontology, the actual data are aggregated to create a knowledge map, which includes both an assertion model (concepts and properties) and an instance model (specific instances for ontological relationships). The main task is to develop an ontology-based representation scheme for terms of the application domain, which facilitates knowledge capture, distribution, and maintenance. The scheme enables computer processing for tasks related to information handling and supporting information exchange. Widely accepted ontology specification methodologies are employed. To avoid unnecessary efforts, emphasis is put on the reuse of existing ontologies or vocabularies, expanded, and adapted to the described case study. The optimal granularity is chosen for efficient ontology operation. The conceptual and technological requirements of the representation scheme are discussed. The methodology is based on software quality standards.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","","","","","","","","EATIS 2024","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Praia, Cape Verde","","","","ontology; earth observation data; remote sensing; semantic.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The key technologies of RAG are retrieval based on similarity and reasoning based on next-token prediction. However, this approach differs significantly from how humans solve problems. Humans typically follow certain analytical logic, reasoning while retrieving relevant information, and then connecting the clues to serve as references, ultimately generating an answer. In this process, the focus is on the semantic type and clear relationships between the keywords rather than similarity and co-occurrence. This difference in methodology results in the answers generated by RAG technology being insufficiently accurate or valuable.In this work, we concentrate on establishing semantic relationships between keywords to enable a more precise expression of knowledge and propose the Knowledge Augmented Generation(KAG) framework. KAG performs semantic parsing and reasoning on both documents and questions, involving three specific strategies: In the indexing phase, we complete the semantic information of keywords and the semantic relationships between them through information extraction and semantic reasoning; in the reasoning phase of question answering, we leverage semantic parsing to transform questions into Logical Forms with clear semantic types and relationships; in the retrieval phase, we predict the semantic relationships between Logical Form elements and structured index, thereby obtaining the required references.We compared KAG with existing RAG methods in three multi-hop QA datasets and the results show that KAG significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

It is common for large and complex systems with distributed teams, to use DSMLs, to express and communicate designs of such systems uniformly, using a common language. DSMLs enable domain experts, with no or minimal software development background, to model solutions, using the language and terminologies used in their respective domains. Although, there are already a number of DSMLs available for modeling CBSs, their need is felt strongly across multiple domains, which still are not well supported with DSMLs. Developing a new DSML, however, is non trivial, as it requires (a) significant knowledge about the domain for which the DSML needs to be developed, as well as (b) skills to create new languages. In the current practice, DSMLs are developed by experts, who have substantial understanding of the domain of interest and strong background in computer science. One of the many challenges in the development of DSMLs, is the collection of domain knowledge and its utilization, based on which the abstract syntax, the backbone of the DSML is defined. There is a clear gap in the current state of art and practice, with respect to overcoming this challenge. We propose a methodology, which makes it easier for people with different backgrounds such as domain experts, solution architects, to contribute towards defining the abstract syntax of the DSML. The methodology outlines a set of steps to systematically capture knowledge about the domain of interest, and use that to arrive at the abstract syntax of the DSML. The key contribution of our work is in abstracting a CBS from a domain into a Domain Specific Machine, embodied in domain specific concepts. The methodology outlines, how the Domain Specific Machine, when coupled with guidelines from current practices of developing DSMLs, results in the definition of the abstract syntax of the intended DSML. We discuss our methodology in detail, in this paper.","2019","2025-09-10 14:11:58","2025-09-10 14:11:58","","1–10","","","","","","","DSM 2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Athens, Greece","","","","modeling; domain specific language; domain specific modeling language; language engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, it details the RDT model, covering its design for an ALOHA dual - arm robot, core methods such as diffusion model design, feature coding, regularization, non - linear action output, and Alternating Condition Injection (ACI). The RDT model is trained on a large number of datasets and fine - tuned on specific data. Experimental results demonstrate that RDT outperforms previous models in tasks such as generalization to unseen objects and scenes, few - shot learning, and dexterous control. Ablation experiments further verify the effectiveness of its key design elements.

Governments have established policies to provide citizens or users with access to data. One way to obtain such data is through Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests. Considering users' requests for data and responding with the required information makes open data ecosystems user-driven. This paper explores freedom of information (FOI) requests received by Germany's Ministry of Health as a user-driven approach to open government data (OGD). By applying advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques, specifically Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, we analyze a large corpus of FOI requests to identify key topics and trends in public inquiries. The findings reveal valuable insights into citizens' information demands and demonstrate the strengths of these NLP methods in extracting actionable patterns. In this way, governments can easily understand user needs in health-related datasets (this study, in particular, focuses on requests made by citizens related to COVID-19 data). This study lays the groundwork in two ways: first, by understanding and thematically categorizing user needs related to open data, and second, by improving government data transparency, informing the prioritization of dataset releases, and supporting evidence-based policymaking.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","1–10","","","","","","","PCI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Open Data; Freedom of Information; Open Data Ecosystems; Open Government Data; Topic Modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, traditional educational Q&amp;A systems face significant limitations, such as reliance on simple keyword matching, inability to provide contextually rich answers, and challenges in handling complex, procedural queries. These limitations often result in incomplete or irrelevant responses, highlighting the need for more sophisticated solutions that can understand and interpret diverse student queries accurately. This research presents the design and implementation of an intelligent course Q&amp;A system that integrates Natural Language Processing (NLP), semantic analysis, and knowledge graph traversal to deliver context-aware, real-time responses to student queries. The system is built upon advanced deep learning techniques, leveraging BERT for answer retrieval, a Bi-LSTM + CRF model for Named Entity Recognition (NER), and a dynamically constructed knowledge graph for multi-step reasoning. The system was evaluated on a dataset of student queries and course content, demonstrating strong performance with an overall accuracy of 88.1%. The results highlight the system's effectiveness in handling factual, conceptual, and procedural questions, offering personalized and relevant answers to enhance the learning experience. However, challenges remain in addressing ambiguous queries, scaling the knowledge graph, and providing detailed procedural explanations. The paper concludes by discussing potential future improvements, such as the integration of interactive dialogue mechanisms, optimized knowledge graphs, and enhanced explanatory models. This intelligent Q&amp;A system represents a step forward in educational technology, offering scalable and adaptable solutions for modern digital learning environments.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","21–28","","","","","","","ISBDAI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Deep Learning; Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Graph; Question-Answering System; Educational Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing gaps in our current understanding are numerous, even on fundamental questions such as whether consistent and high-quality recipe recommendation can be delivered across languages. Motivated by this need, we consider the multi-language recipe recommendation setting and present grounding results that will help to establish the potential and absolute value of future work in this area. Our work draws on several billion events from millions of recipes, with published recipes and users incorporating several languages, including Arabic, English, Indonesian, Russian, and Spanish. We represent recipes using a combination of normalised ingredients, standardised skills and image embeddings obtained without human intervention. In modelling, we take a classical approach based on optimising an embedded bi-linear user-item metric space towards the interactions that most strongly elicit cooking intent. For users without interaction histories, a bespoke content-based cold-start model that predicts context and recipe affinity is introduced. We show that our approach to personalisation is stable and scales well to new languages. A robust cross-validation campaign is employed and consistently rejects baseline models and representations, strongly favouring those we propose. Our results are presented in a language-oriented (as opposed to model-oriented) fashion to emphasise the language-based goals of this work.

The safe extension of LLMs into safety-critical professional domains requires assurance not only of epistemic but ethical alignment. This paper adopts a theoretical and philosophical approach, drawing from metaethical theories to argue for a distinction hinging around quantitative, axiological comparability that separates Kantian ethics from not only the utilitarianism it is well-known to oppose, but from just distribution theories as well, which are key to debiasing LLM models. It presents the novel hypothesis that LLM ethical acquisition from both corpus induction and RLHF may encounter value conflicts between Kantian and just distribution principles that intensify as they come into improved alignment with both theories, hinging around the variability by which self-attention may statistically attend to the same characterizations as more person-like or more resource-like under distinct prompting strategies.","2025","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","1190–1199","","","","","","","AIES '24","","","","AAAI Press","San Jose, California, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is of utmost importance to provide a personalized system which can automatically adapt to learners' learning styles, knowledge level and intelligently recommend resources that would favor and improve the learning. The existing PLEs still exhibit cold-start problems and other issues related with mapping of learning style and learning object. To solve these issues and to improve the dynamicity of the PLEs, an appropriate learner/learning object model is very essential. In this paper, we introduce an ontology model which encapsulates both learner profile and learning object attributes, which can be used for the content recommendation in an e-learning platform. Learner profile is the representation of learner data which includes both static and dynamic characteristics of the learner. The static data is gathered directly from the learner using forms and questionnaires and dynamic data is collected by tracking the behavior of learners, while interacting through a learning management system. The proposed ontology also holds space for learning topics and their corresponding Learning Object (LO) characteristics. The elements which come under the educational category of IEEE LOM standard, is considered for tagging the selected learning objects in the ontology. The JENA API of Java programming language is used for developing the ontology. The data is described using Resource Description Framework (RDF) tools.

However, enabling end-users to interact with these smart devices in an intuitive and natural way becomes increasingly important as they become more pervasive in our homes, workplaces and public environments. Voice-based interfaces are the emerging trend to provide a more natural human-device interaction in smart environments. Such interfaces require Natural Language Understanding (NLU) approaches to identify the meaning of end-users' voice inputs. Designing voice interfaces that are not limited to a small, fixed set of pre-defined commands is far from trivial. Existing voice-based solutions in the smart home domain either restrict the end-users to follow a strict language pattern, do not support indirect goals, require a large training dataset, or need a voice assistant located in the cloud. In this paper, we propose an approach for understanding end-users goals from voice inputs in smart homes. Our approach alleviates the need for end-users to learn or remember concrete operations of the devices and specific words/pattern structures rather it enables them to control their smart homes based on the desired goals (effects). We evaluate the approach through application to a collection of 253 goals from real end-users and report on quality metrics.

In this paper, we address the limitations of current methods and explore a hybrid approach for KC extraction, which combines automated code parsing with an expert-built ontology. We use an introductory (CS1) Java benchmark dataset to compare its KC extraction performance with the traditional extraction methods using a state-of-the-art evaluation approach based on learning curves.

An ontology offers among others a highly descriptive structured representation and capabilities for inconsistencies checking and querying. Another well-known method is knowledge graphs, which offers a relation-based visualizable structure and querying capability, which are more convenient than those in ontologies. However, knowledge graphs cannot check inconsistencies. Therefore, we present an approach for context representation development, where an ontology is first created, checked and evaluated, and afterwards is converted into a knowledge graph. This approach assures design and implementation of more convenient and consistent context representations. The approach is applied to the creation of a robotics related ontology, where Protégé is used for ontology creation and logical consistency checking (via HermiT reasoner), OOPS! is used for ontology evaluation, and Neo4j is used for converting the ontology to a knowledge graph. Example queries in both representations show the preferability to knowledge graph, while an example shows the inability of knowledge graph to trace inconsistencies.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","","","","","","","","SETN '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","knowledge graphs; ontologies; knowledge representation; robot context representation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we take the first steps toward solving this problem with three key contributions.First, we introduce TermMiner, an automated data collection and topic modeling pipeline to understand the landscape of unfavorable financial terms. Second, we create ShopTC-100K, a dataset of terms and conditions from shopping websites in the Tranco top 100K list, comprising 1.8 million terms from 8,251 websites. Consequently, we develop a taxonomy of 22 types from 4 categories of unfavorable financial terms—spanning purchase, post-purchase, account termination, and legal aspects. Third, we build TermLens, an automated detector that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to identify unfavorable financial terms.Fine-tuned on an annotated dataset, TermLens achieves an F1 score of 94.6% and a false positive rate of 2.3% using GPT-4o. When applied to shopping websites from the Tranco top 100K, we find that 42.06% of these sites contain at least one unfavorable financial term, with such terms being more prevalent on less popular websites.

The main paradigm in automatically generating proper Knowledge Graphs relies on predefined schemas or ontologies. Such schemas are typically manually constructed, requiring an intensive human effort, and are often sensitive to information loss due to negligence, incomplete analysis, or human subjectivity or inclination. Limiting human bias and the resulting information loss in creating proper Knowledge Graphs is paramount, particularly for user modeling in various sectors, such as education or healthcare. To this end, we propose a novel approach to automatically generating a proper entity schema. The devised methodology combines the language understanding capabilities of LLM with classical machine learning methods such as clustering to properly build an entity schema from a set of documents. This solution eliminates the need for human intervention and fosters a more efficient and comprehensive knowledge representation. The assessment of our proposal concerns adopting a state-of-the-art entity extraction model (UniNER) to estimate the relevance of the extracted entities based on the generated schema. Results confirm the potential of our approach, as we observed a negligible difference between the topic similarity score obtained with the ground truth and with the automatically generated schema (less than 1% on average on three different datasets). Such an outcome confirms that the proposed approach may be valuable in automatically creating an entity schema from a set of documents.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","467–473","","","","","","","UMAP Adjunct '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cagliari, Italy","","","","Large Language Models; Ontology Learning; Named Entity Recognition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) many stakeholders are involved in procedural modelling activities. Consequently, there is a need to identify appropriate modelling approaches at each modelling activity and development stage.

Such trend presents a challenging paradigm shift in how military organizations approach mosaic warfare in the digital age since new attack vectors and targets appear in their landscapes. In this vein, it is pivotal for military teams to have a clear and concise roadmap for cybersecurity incidents linked to potential mosaic warfare. This manuscript introduces a novel approach to bolstering mosaic warfare strategies by integrating an advanced Knowledge Representation and Reasoning system and a tailored ontology. Motivated by the critical role of cybersecurity in contemporary warfare, the proposed system aims to enhance situational awareness, decision-making capabilities, and operational effectiveness in the face of evolving cyber threats. In this sense, this manuscript entails a new ontology that not only covers the cybersecurity realm but also introduces key concepts related to strategic and operational military levels at the same time. The ad-hoc ontology is also compared against other well-known ones, such as MITRE, NATO, or UCO approaches and manifests a significant performance by employing standardized quality metrics for ontologies. Lastly, a realistic mosaic warfare scenario is contextualized to demonstrate the deployment of the proposed system and how it can properly represent all information gathered from heterogeneous data sources.","2024","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","","","","","","","","ARES '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","Knowledge graph; Ontology; Reasoning; Knowledge representation; Cyber defense; Mosaic warfare","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the context of Digital Humanities, the research perspective of humanities scholars is gradually shifting towards data-driven research, with linked data emerging as a popular topic. A well-defined and standard ontology representing the complete domain knowledge is essential for linked Ding data. Unfortunately, most existing ontology cannot represent fine-grained knowledge of Ding or is too restrictive to represent partial knowledge of bronze Ding. In this context, we propose a fine-grained Ding ontology to represent the bronze Ding knowledge. In this paper, we present in detail the Ding ontology of Chinese bronze during the Shang and Zhou dynasties (from 1600 BC to 256 BC). We provide a detailed exposition of the Ding ontology and evaluate its effectiveness using OOPS!, OntoMetrics, and by answering competency questions in SPARQL. The building methodology of Ding ontology follows the ISO principles (ISO 1087 and ISO 704).

In our recent work, we proposed an approach to tackle these issues with a user simulator, USi. Given a description of an information need, USi is capable of automatically answering clarifying questions about the topic throughout the search session. However, while the answers generated by USi are both in line with the underlying information need and in natural language, a deeper understanding of such utterances is lacking. Thus, in this work, we explore utterance formulation of large language model (LLM)–based user simulators. To this end, we first analyze the differences between USi, based on GPT-2, and the next generation of generative LLMs, such as GPT-3. Then, to gain a deeper understanding of LLM-based utterance generation, we compare the generated answers to the recently proposed set of patterns of human-based query reformulations. Finally, we discuss potential applications as well as limitations of LLM-based user simulators and outline promising directions for future work on the topic.","2024-05","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","","","3","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","conversational search; mixed-initiative; User simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The basic element of GO is a term, which includes a set of genes with the same function. Existing research efforts of GO mainly focus on predicting gene term associations. Other tasks, such as generating descriptions of new terms, are rarely pursued. In this paper, we propose a novel task: GO term description generation. This task aims to automatically generate a sentence that describes the function of a GO term belonging to one of the three categories, i.e., molecular function, biological process, and cellular component. To address this task, we propose a Graph-in-Graph network that can efficiently leverage the structural information of GO. The proposed network introduces a two-layer graph: the first layer is a graph of GO terms where each node is also a graph (gene graph). Such a Graph-in-Graph network can derive the biological functions of GO terms and generate proper descriptions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed network, we build three large-scale benchmark datasets. By incorporating the proposed Graph-in-Graph network, the performances of seven different sequence-to-sequence models can be substantially boosted across all evaluation metrics, with up to 34.7%, 14.5%, and 39.1% relative improvements in BLEU, ROUGE-L, and METEOR, respectively.","2022","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","1060–1068","","","","","","","KDD '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Washington DC, USA","","","","bioinformatics; natural language generation; gene ontology; graph representations; sequence-to-sequence learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To achieve highly accepted sets of annotated documents, the Fleiss' kappa score has been widely used to observe the level of agreement from annotated results, submitted by different human annotators. The challenge is that the kappa score cannot be used to validate the type systems nor to identify any incorrect annotations. Thus, we proposed an application of formal logic for validating type systems and annotations against expert rules. Experiments have been done by using four different type systems and annotation sets created by an expert and three novices. Our proposed formal logic model was used to validate the novice type systems and annotations against the expert rules. The results show that the technique could help identifying inconsistencies between expert and novice annotations, by using a model checker. The number of detected inconsistencies impacts the level of achieved F1 score. Thus, the proposed formal logic technique could be used to guide novice annotators to develop accepted type systems.

Content on the Semantic Web can be subject to reasoning and queries with standardized languages, methods and tools, which opens new opportunities for collaborative creation, use and exploration of web repositories. However, these opportunities have not been exploited so far by the available 3D formats and modeling tools, which limits the possibilities of search and reuse of 3D content as part of the Semantic Web. This work contributes a semantic development pipeline of the X3D Ontology, with corresponding conversion of X3D models into triple forms suitable for formal query. The ontology design reflects experience accompanying the development of the Extensible 3D (X3D) Graphics International Standard, in particular, the X3D Unified Object Model (X3DUOM). This approach combines semantic and syntactic elements of X3D models and metadata to support integration with the Semantic Web. The pipeline enables automatic generation of the X3D Ontology, thereby providing an up-to-date 3D representation with semantics during X3D specification development.

Modifications should occur without affecting the integrity of constituents, the accomplishment of SoS missions, neither their reliability, security, safety, nor other quality attributes. Architecting SoS requires then important investments in human, time, and economic resources, bringing big challenges. Architectural patterns have been widely used to improve software architecture quality, decreasing costs of design and promoting reuse of good practices and well-known solutions. Nowadays, a great amount of architectural patterns is available; most of them are domain-independent, which harness their selection in specific software projects. The main goal of this paper is to contribute to reduce the work of architects during the choice of better architectural patterns for their SoS. For this, we present a set of patterns that are commonly used to construct such architectures. Additionally, benefits of adopting these patterns are described. To demonstrate their feasibility, we present HSH-SoS, a pattern-base architecture for SoS that presents how different patterns can interact to create a solution for SoS. As results, the architectural patterns reported in this work are feasible candidates to compose a language for recurrent problems in SoS architectures. However, formalization of such language is an open issue that we intend to address in future works.","2021","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","","","","","","","","PLoP '19","","","","The Hillside Group","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Urbana, Illinois","","","","software architecture; architectural pattern; architectural patterns; patterns language; systems-of-systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the composition of simulation models and other simulation studies’ products must be supported beyond syntactical coherence, including aspects of semantics and purpose, enabling their effective reuse. A higher degree of automating simulation studies will contribute to more systematic, standardized simulation studies and their efficiency. Finally, it is essential to invest increased effort into effectively communicating results and the processes involved in simulation studies to enable their use in research and decision making.

It is also effective to give presentations to stakeholders about how business processes will be carried out after the requirements are implemented. Issues are raised in building requirements modeling as business users generally do not have enough knowledge to build requirements models in specific notations. Transforming requirements (natural language) into semi-formal notation (BPMN) manually lead to inconsistency of elements structure. The need to automatically generate requirements model become crucial because it will be the basis for the programming process. Existing studies are mostly concerned on auto-completion of modeling language using domain ontology as basic knowledge, and let the stakeholders building initial requirements model with limited knowledge. The idea of this paper is to propose a methodology for building business process model in semi-formal language (BPMN) to represent future business processes using ontology approach.

Moreover, there is no consensus surface realization architecture created for other languages that can be adapted for the languages in question. In this work, we solve this by creating a novel surface realizer architecture suitable for low-resourced African languages that abides by the features of maintainable software.

However, in many cases, it is necessary to incorporate semantic content that helps to organize the information so that it can be processed automatically, by government authorities and interested users.

Whereas in the former area the emphasis was more on designing and implementing concrete repair algorithms, the latter area concentrated on characterizing classes of contraction operations by certain postulates they satisfy. In the classical setting, repairs and contractions are subsets of the knowledge base that no longer have the unwanted consequence. This makes these approaches syntax-dependent and may result in removal of more consequences than necessary. To alleviate this problem, gentle repairs and pseudo-constractions have been introduced in the respective research areas, and their connections have been investigated in recent work. Optimal repairs preserve a maximal amount of consequences, but they may not always exist. We show that, if they exist, then they can be obtained by certain pseudo-contraction operations, and thus they comply with the postulates that these operations satisfy. Conversely, under certain conditions, pseudo-contractions are guaranteed to produce optimal repairs. Recently, contraction operations have also been defined for concepts rather than for whole knowledge bases. We show that there is again a close connection between such operations and optimal repairs of a restricted form of knowledge bases.","2023-09","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","5–18","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","description logic; belief change; ontology repair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The semantic interoperability of Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) requires rich and well-defined metadata, as well as the establishment of standards, in order to be able to connect and link these scattered legal data resources. This is usually achieved through the transformation of legal information into structured format and through the utilization of legal ontologies whose main purpose is to connect the legal basis of two or more countries by allowing for reusability and the ability to adequately represent legal information, which is understood and retrieved across borders. Within the context of this study, the European Legislation Identifier (ELI) and Akoma Ntoso (AKN) ontologies are mapped in order to make legal data compatible and reusable in as many contexts as possible and to support the Linked Open Legal Data (LOLD) concept. The mapping of these two widely used legal ontologies was evaluated by domain experts and strongly validated by tools. The usefulness of the produced mapping is proven through its real-life context application, although one thing to consider regarding possible future perspectives, could be the inclusion and mapping of more legal ontologies to expand the application domain and improve the semantic interoperability of legal information. These mappings could be either achieved using similar methodological approaches or applications of automated and AI-based ontology mapping techniques.","2023","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","41–53","","","","","","","ICEGOV '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Belo Horizonte, Brazil","","","","semantic interoperability; Open Government Data; legal data; legal information; linked open legal data (LOLD); OGD; ontology mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To facilitate the assessment and learning of CPS competence, researchers have proposed a series of frameworks to conceptualize CPS and explored ways to make sense of the complex processes involved in collaborative problem solving. However, encoding explicit behaviors into subskills within the frameworks of CPS skills is still a challenging task. Traditional studies have relied on manual coding to decipher behavioral data for CPS, but such coding methods can be very time-consuming and cannot support real-time analyses. Scholars have begun to explore approaches for constructing automatic coding models. Nevertheless, the existing models built using machine learning or deep learning techniques depend on a large amount of training data and have relatively low accuracy. To address these problems, this paper proposes a prompt-based learning pre-trained model. The model can achieve high performance even with limited training data. In this study, three experiments were conducted, and the results showed that our model not only produced the highest accuracy, macro F1 score, and kappa values on large training sets, but also performed the best on small training sets of the CPS behavioral data. The application of the proposed prompt-based learning pre-trained model contributes to the CPS skills coding task and can also be used for other CSCW coding tasks to replace manual coding.","2024-11","2025-09-10 14:11:59","2025-09-10 14:11:59","","","","CSCW2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","natural language processing; automatic coding; collaborative problem solving; prompt-based learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we are closing the gap by introducing an SDoEd ontology for creating a precise conceptualization of the interplay between life circumstances of students and their possible educational achievements. The ontology was developed utilizing suggestions from ChatGPT-3.5-010422 and validated using peer-reviewed research articles. The first version of developed ontology was evaluated by human experts in the field of education and validated using standard ontology evaluation software. This version of the SDoEd ontology contains 231 domain concepts, 10 object properties, and 24 data properties.","2024-10","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","191–203","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Evansville, IN, USA Publisher: Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rise of smart personal assistants (SPAs), however, we have reached a new milestone along the path towards this goal. These systems assist their owners by providing personalized and context-dependent information and service. Today's implementations reach from conversational agents, such as Siri, Cortana or Google Assistant, over chatbots, which are primarily text-based, to cognitive assistants, which assist according to a user's current cognitive or emotional state. However, although both research and practice proceed with full pace, recurring design elements of SPAs have not yet been investigated. We hence propose a pattern language for smart personal assistants to guide further empirical and design efforts. Therefore, we review existing information systems, computer science and human-computer interaction literature to find recurring design characteristics among 115 different assistants. The resulting pattern language contains 22 patterns that specify the interaction behavior and the intelligence of smart personal assistants.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","","","","","","PLoP '18","","","","The Hillside Group","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Portland, Oregon","","","","pattern language; smart personal assistants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our method, LAPS, addresses this by using large language models (LLMs) to guide a single human worker in generating personalized dialogues. This method has proven to speed up the creation process and improve quality. LAPS can collect large-scale, human-written, multi-session, and multi-domain conversations, including extracting user preferences. When compared to existing datasets, LAPS-produced conversations are as natural and diverse as expert-created ones, which stays in contrast with fully synthetic methods. The collected dataset is suited to train preference extraction and personalized response generation. Our results show that responses generated explicitly using extracted preferences better match user's actual preferences, highlighting the value of using extracted preferences over simple dialogue history. Overall, LAPS introduces a new method to leverage LLMs to create realistic personalized conversational data more efficiently and effectively than previous methods.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","796–806","","","","","","","SIGIR '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Washington DC, USA","","","","personalization; conversational search; dialogue collection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, archival assets are evolving to encompass digitized documents and increasing quantities of born-digital information in diverse formats. On the other hand, the audience is changing along with how it wishes to access archival material. Moreover, the interoperability requirements of cultural heritage repositories are growing. In this context, the Portuguese Archives started an ambitious program aiming to evolve its data model, migrate existing records, and build a new archival management system appropriate to both archival tasks and public access. The overall goal is to have a fine-grained and flexible description, more machine-actionable than the current one. This work describes ArchOnto, a linked open data model for archives, and rules for its automatic population from existing records. ArchOnto adopts a semantic web approach and encompasses the CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and additional ontologies, envisioning interoperability with datasets curated by multiple communities of practice. Existing ISAD(G)-conforming descriptions are being migrated to the new model using the direct mappings provided here. We used a sample of 25 records associated with different description levels to validate the completeness and conformity of ArchOnto to existing data. This work is in progress and is original in several respects: (1) it is one of the first approaches to use CIDOC CRM in the context of archives, identifying problems and questions that emerged during the process and pinpointing possible solutions; (2) it addresses the balance in the model between the migration of existing records and the construction of new ones by archive professionals; and (3) it adopts an open world view on linking archival data to global information sources.","2023-11","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Cultural heritage; semantic web; archival description; archives; data migration; linked open data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Circular economy models (e.g., circular value networks) are typically complex and networked, involving different cross-industry domains. In the context of a circular value network, multiple actors, such as suppliers, manufacturers, recyclers, and product end-users, may be involved. In addition, there may be various flows of resources, energy, information and value throughout the network. This means that we face the challenge that the data and information from cross-industry domains in a circular economy model are not built on common ground, and as a result are difficult to understand and use for both humans and machines. Using ontologies to represent domain knowledge can enable actors and stakeholders from different industries in the circular economy to communicate using a common language. The knowledge domains involved include circular economy, sustainability, materials, products, manufacturing, and logistics.

Automatically solving ageWPs is a challenging task as we need to tackle temporal relationships between the agent’s ages, frame and solve the equations for the required unknowns. To the best of our knowledge, there exists only one ageWP dataset consisting of just 124 examples. The dataset is too small to employ a learning-based solver, mainly consisting of ageWPs with simple temporal relationships. To address this issue, in our earlier work, we designed a description-logic based ontology (ageWP-ont) for the domain of age word problems and utilized it to automatically generate a large number of ageWPs. Sentences in these ageWPs relate the ages of agents in a temporally complex manner. In this paper, we focus on solving these problems. We analyzed an existing learning-based solver of algebraic word-problems that uses a traditional machine learning approach and found that the solver can be adapted to our domain. But we found that this approach does not seem to perform well, perhaps due to the complex nature of the ageWPs. As we have the ontology of the domain on hand, we propose a new approach of utilizing it in the deep-learning based NLU component of the solution. We annotate parts of the ageWP sentences with class-names from ageWP-ont and train a BERT-based language model (LM) that learns to predict the instances for these classes in the given sentences. An RDF graph is populated with these values and serves as a concrete problem-specific instance of the ontology. The dataset for training the LM is automatically generated with the help of ageWP-ont. Finally, for the actual solving of a given ageWP, we make use of its RDF graph and employ Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We implemented the proposed system and achieved 68.8% accuracy. The work demonstrates that combining deep learning with ontologies can give impressive results.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","95–103","","","","","","","CODS-COMAD '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Mumbai, India","","","","BERT; SWRL; Age-word problem solver; OWL-DL ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conventionally, a TOD system adheres to a fixed paradigm, where it must first extract user goals and query external databases before it can generate the final response. However, this fixed extract-and-query paradigm is not always optimal for all dialogue turns, which is redundant for the simple turns that do not need external information, and is inadequate for the complex turns that need to interact with the external world multiple times. To address the limitations, in this article, we propose AgentTOD, a novel TOD framework that uses a large language model (LLM) as the intelligent agent to achieve a flexible dialogue paradigm. AgentTOD deprecates the traditional modular architecture (including dialogue state tracking and dialogue policy) by utilizing an LLM as the controller brain to determine when and how to call the provided APIs to obtain external information. It can choose to call APIs any number of times with various parameters until it’s enough to reply to the user. Besides, to train AgentTOD, we construct a large and comprehensive TOD dataset, called TrajsTOD (Trajectories of TODs), which consists of 66k+ user-agent dialogue trajectories converted from eight popular TOD datasets covering 60 domains. TrajsTOD is constructed with minimal dialogue annotations where only the API calling logs are needed and can empower AgentTOD with the general ability to call APIs and generate responses according to the task definition.

While neural networks excel at pattern recognition, they struggle to maintain logical consistency. Conversely, symbolic systems provide formal reasoning capabilities but lack mechanisms for handling perceptual uncertainty. This paper introduces EmALC , a novel neuro-symbolic framework that bridges neural perception with symbolic logic through differentiable fuzzy semantics. Our approach addresses a key limitation of existing methods: while previous neuro-symbolic approaches like Logic Tensor Networks employ first-order fuzzy logic, where key reasoning problems are undecidable, EmALC ensures decidable reasoning by leveraging a fuzzy variant of ALC – a decidable fragment of first-order logic. Unlike previous approaches that often compromise logical soundness for learning capability, EmALC maintains provable semantic consistency through a hierarchical loss function while mitigating reasoning shortcuts via rule-based revision strategies. Experimental evaluation demonstrates EmALC's effectiveness: on ontology revision tasks, it achieves 100% success rate in correcting masked groundings while preserving semantic integrity; on semantic image interpretation tasks, it improves object classification F1-scores by up to 5.56% through ontology-guided knowledge revision.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","3240–3249","","","","","","","KDD '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Toronto ON, Canada","","","","description logic; differentiable fuzzy semantics; neuro-symbolic computing; symbol grounding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Healthcare","","","10.1145/3604561","https://doi.org/10.1145/3604561","Discovering causal relationships among symptoms is a topical issue in the analysis of observational patient datasets. A Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) is a popular analytical framework for causal inference. While there are many methods and algorithms capable of learning a Bayesian network, they are reliant on the complexity and thoroughness of the algorithm and do not consider prior expertise from authoritative sources. This article proposes a novel method of extracting prior causal knowledge contained in Authoritative Medical Ontologies (AMOs) and using this prior knowledge to orient arcs in a CBN learned from observational patient data. Since AMOs are robust biomedical ontologies containing the collective knowledge of the experts who created them, utilizing the ordering information contained within them produces improved CBNs that provide additional insight into the disease domain.To demonstrate our method, we obtained prior causal ordering information among symptoms from three AMOs: (1) the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA), (2) the International Classification of Diseases Version 10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), and (3) Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). The prior ontological knowledge from these three AMOs is then used to orient arcs in a series of CBNs learned from the National Institutes of Mental Health study on Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) patient dataset using the Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC) algorithm. Six distinct CBNs are generated using MMHC: an unmodified baseline model using only the algorithm, three CBNs oriented with ordered-variable pairs from MedDRA, ICD-10-CM, and SNOMED CT, and two more with ordered pairs from a combination of these AMOs. The resulting CBNs modified using ordered-variable pairs significantly change the structure of the network. The agreement between the Modified networks and the Baseline ranges from 50% to 90%. A modified network using ordering information from all ontologies obtained an agreement of 50% (10 out of 20 arcs exist in both the Baseline and Modified models) while maintaining comparable predictive accuracy. This indicates that the Modified CBN reflects the causal claims in the AMOs and agrees with both the AMOs and the observational STAR*D dataset. Furthermore, the Modified models discovered new potentially causal relationships among symptoms in the model, while eliminating weaker edges in a qualitative analysis of the significance of these relationships in existing epidemiological research.","2023-10","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","4","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; Bayesian networks; data mining; healthcare data; data management; Patient data; ontology evolution; causal inference; causal networks; causality; healthcare information technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These models are defined using different modeling languages and constructed using diverse tools. They represent different but often interdependent views. However, the models of a system are far from being static. They change to accommodate new requirements, functionality improvements, bug fixes, and other evolution events. These changes represent a challenge w.r.t. consistency. This is especially true in security-critical scenarios. Indeed, security information is often integrated within the systems models so that security requirements are met following what is called ""security-by-design"". In such scenarios, the security concern of the systems models must remain consistent across changes so that security properties continue to hold. In order to tackle this problem, we propose a methodology to enhance the (multi)model-based design phase of a system development process. It comprises the creation of a security federation in which security dependencies between the different models are reified and equipped with security rules expressing security consistency requirements. Then, whenever a model is changed, the security rules are evaluated to monitor the consistency of security across the system models. We evaluate the capabilities of this methodology by a prototype implementation and its application to different use cases.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","66–76","","","","","","","ICSSP '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: M\, Germany","","","","Model-driven engineering; model evolution.; model federation; security by design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our research project PARSE that aims at naturalistic end-user programming in spoken natural language serves as an example. We integrate a dialog component with PARSE without affecting its other components: We modularize the dialog management and introduce dialog acts that bundle a trigger for the dialog and the reaction of the system.

This paper presents a methodology and the Genie toolkit that can handle new compound commands with significantly less manual effort. We advocate formalizing the capability of virtual assistants with a Virtual Assistant Programming Language (VAPL) and using a neural semantic parser to translate natural language into VAPL code. Genie needs only a small realistic set of input sentences for validating the neural model. Developers write templates to synthesize data; Genie uses crowdsourced paraphrases and data augmentation, along with the synthesized data, to train a semantic parser. We also propose design principles that make VAPL languages amenable to natural language translation. We apply these principles to revise ThingTalk, the language used by the Almond virtual assistant. We use Genie to build the first semantic parser that can support compound virtual assistants commands with unquoted free-form parameters. Genie achieves a 62% accuracy on realistic user inputs. We demonstrate Genie’s generality by showing a 19% and 31% improvement over the previous state of the art on a music skill, aggregate functions, and access control.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","394–410","","","","","","","PLDI 2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Phoenix, AZ, USA","","","","data engineering; semantic parsing; data augmentation; training data generation; virtual assistants","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It often involves people with different backgrounds (e.g., Arts, Software Engineering, Design), which makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore ontologies to represent structured knowledge and improve knowledge sharing in HCI design. We briefly present the Human-Computer Interaction Design Ontology (HCIDO), a reference ontology that addresses HCI design aspects that connect HCI and Software Engineering concerns. By making knowledge related to the HCI design domain explicit and structured, HCIDO has helped us to develop KTID, a tool that aims to support capturing and sharing useful knowledge to aid in HCI design. Preliminary results indicate that the tool may be particularly useful for novice HCI designers.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","","","","","","IHC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Brazil","","","","Ontology; Knowledge; HCI Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Scientific literature networks and knowledge graphs are typically large, sparse, and noisy, and often contain missing links, potential but unobserved connections, between concepts, entities, or methods. Here, we present an AI-driven hierarchical link prediction framework that integrates matrix factorization to infer hidden associations and steer discovery in complex material domains. Our method combines Hierarchical Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (HNMFk), Boolean matrix factorization (BNMFk) with automatic model selection. These discrete factors are then fused with Logistic matrix factorization (LMF), we use to construct a three-level topic tree from a 46,862-document corpus focused on 73 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This class of materials has been studied in a variety of physics fields and has a multitude of current and potential applications.An ensemble BNMFk + LMF approach fuses discrete interpretability with probabilistic scoring. The resulting HNMFk clusters map each material onto coherent research themes, such as superconductivity, energy storage, and tribology, and highlight missing or weakly connected links between topics and materials, suggesting novel hypotheses for cross-disciplinary exploration. We validate our method by removing publications about superconductivity in well-known superconductors, and demonstrate that the model correctly predicts their association with the superconducting TMD clusters. This highlights the ability of the method to find hidden connections in a graph of material to latent topic associations built from scientific literature. This is especially useful when examining a diverse corpus of scientific documents covering the same class of phenomena or materials but originating from distinct communities and perspectives. The inferred links generating new hypotheses, produced by our method, are exposed through an interactive Streamlit dashboard, designed for scientific discovery.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","","","","","","DocEng '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Nottingham, United Kingdom","","","","Link Prediction; NMF; LMF; Matrix completion; NMFk","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, many of these approaches are either specifically targeted at open-domain question answering using DBpedia, or require large training datasets to translate a natural language question to SPARQL in order to query the knowledge graph. Hence, these approaches often cannot be applied directly to complex scientific datasets where no prior training data is available. In this paper, we focus on the challenges of natural language processing over knowledge graphs of scientific datasets. In particular, we introduce Bio-SODA, a natural language processing engine that does not require training data in the form of question-answer pairs for generating SPARQL queries. Bio-SODA uses a generic graph-based approach for translating user questions to a ranked list of SPARQL candidate queries. Furthermore, Bio-SODA uses a novel ranking algorithm that includes node centrality as a measure of relevance for selecting the best SPARQL candidate query. Our experiments with real-world datasets across several scientific domains, including the official bioinformatics Question Answering over Linked Data (QALD) challenge, as well as the CORDIS dataset of European projects, show that Bio-SODA outperforms publicly available KGQA systems by an F1-score of least 20% and by an even higher factor on more complex bioinformatics datasets.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","61–72","","","","","","","SSDBM '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tampa, FL, USA","","","","Knowledge Graphs; Ranking; Question Answering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To bridge the gap between knowledge and text, we propose a collective training algorithm to optimize representations jointly.

In this regard, Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) is considered as a key enabler by many central players of the SE community. MBSE has reached an adequate level of maturity, and there exist documented success stories in its adoption in industry. In particular, one significant benefit of utilising MBSE when compared to the traditional manual and document-centric workflows is that models are available from early phases of systems development; these enable a multitude of analyses prior any implementation effort together with other relevant capabilities, like the automation of development tasks. Nonetheless, it is noticeable there is a lack of a common understanding for how formal analyses for the verification and validation (V&amp;V) of systems behaviour, specifically in the early phases of development, could be placed in an MBSE setting.In this article, we report on the planning, execution, and results of a systematic literature review regarding the early V&amp;V of systems behaviour in the context of model-based systems engineering. The review aims to provide a structured representation of the state of the art with respect to motivations, proposed solutions, and limitations. From an initial set of potentially relevant 701 peer-reviewed publications we selected 149 primary studies, which we analysed according to a rigorous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process. Based on our results, early V&amp;V has usually the goal of checking the quality of a system design to avoid discovering flaws when parts are being concretely realised; SysML is a de facto standard for describing the system under study, while the solutions for the analyses tend to be varied; also V&amp;V analyses tend to target varied properties with a slight predominance of functional concerns, and following the variation mentioned so far the proposed solutions are largely context specific; the proposed approaches are usually presented without explicit limitations, while when limitations are discussed, readiness of the solutions, handling of analyses simplifications/assumptions, and languages/tools integration are among the most frequently mentioned issues.Based on the survey results and the standard SE practices, we discuss how the current state-of-the-art MBSE supports early V&amp;V of systems behaviour with a special focus on industrial adoption and identify relevant challenges to be researched further.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","3","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","MBSE; systematic literature review; validation; system behaviour; verification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural Language Query answering systems have thus seen widespread usage in industry too where business users want to search their own data to make business decisions. However, a common challenge faced by any natural language query answering system is generation of precise interpretations. The research community although tries to handle the problem via asking clarification questions back to the user, in industry setup this remains an ineffective solution due to various practical usage limitations. For example, it is not fair to assume any end user will be aware of the correct option to answer these clarification questions. Moreover, involving clarification questions and user feedbacks makes the system unusable by one shot API calls, which is the most intuitive usage among common use cases in industry like automated report generation.

In existing tools, domain-specific modeling languages are well supported. However when it comes to enforcing design constraints, existing approaches are verbose, it is difficult to be complete and consistent, and the reuse of knowledge is only possible in a limited way (mainly through model libraries). Furthermore, current tools usually lack or have limited capability to detect semantic errors, ability to evaluate the models with respect to formal expert knowledge, and the ability to understand what is being designed. Our work addresses these limitations through the semantic annotation of UML models in Papyrus (an MBSE Tool), to attach domain-specific semantics to the models. This integration enables not only reasoning capabilities over the annotated models, but the models can be shared with semantic-compatible tools and stakeholders. Moreover, the models can reuse and integrate knowledge generated outside the tooling environment. The approach's feasibility is demonstrated through an implementation that defines a technology stack, with emphasis on the mapping of UML elements and its counterparts in the ontology. We address the coherence and preservation of the semantics throughout the transformation process, which enable the formalization of constraints coming from the UML's system design. Finally, we illustrate the reasoning capabilities by evaluating expert knowledge via SPARQL queries and SWRL rules.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","351–358","","","","","","","MODELS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","ontology; semantic interoperability; UML; model-driven engineering; knowledge based engineering; Papyrus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After six weeks of interaction, we find that for a successful relationship, the non-human counterpart must be authentic about its machine nature and limitations. Using deception to appear more human-like makes the relationship fail. We thus suggest designing machine relationships as complementary to human-human relationships. For authentic interactions, humans should be in control, with the machine authentically assuming a role that ""naturally"" fits machines. Here, the unique qualities of machines in social interactions offer promising starting points for designing such roles.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:00","2025-09-10 14:12:00","","","","","","","","","NordiCHI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Uppsala, Sweden","","","","human-AI interaction; autobiographical research through design; autoethnography","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our motivation is to reduce the effort related to the modeling part when specifying DEVS models for complex systems described from an abstraction of reality built over a research question.

However, the sheer volume of crisis-related messages on social media can make it challenging for officials to find pertinent information and understand the public’s perception of evolving risks. To address this issue, crisis informatics researchers have proposed a variety of technological solutions, but there has been limited examination of the cognitive and perceptual processes and subsequent responses of the affected population. Yet, this information is critical for the crisis response officials to gauge public’s understanding of the event, their perception of event-related risk, and perception of incident response and recovery efforts, in turn enabling the officials to craft crisis communication messaging more effectively. Taking cues from the Protective Action Decision Model, we conceptualize a metric (resonance+) that prioritizes the cognitive and perceptual processes of the affected population, quantifying shifts in collective attention and information exposure for each tweet. Based on resonance+, we develop a principled, scalable pipeline that recommends content relating to people’s cognitive and perceptual processes. Our results suggest that resonance+ is generalizable across different types of natural hazards. We have also demonstrated its applicability for near-real-time scenarios. According to the feedback from the target users, the local public information officers in emergency management, the messages recommended by our pipeline are useful in their tasks of understanding public perception and finding hopeful narratives, potentially leading to more effective crisis communications.","2025-02","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","","","3–4","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","word embedding; crisis communication; Crisis informatics; protective action decision model; social media data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, system reconfiguration can change the causal relationship between faults and symptoms, which leads to a drop in FD accuracy. In this paper, we present Fault-Symptom Brick (FSBrick), an extension to the Brick metadata schema intended to represent information necessary to propagate system configuration changes onto FD algorithms, and ultimately revise FSRs explicitly or implicitly. We motivate the need to represent FSRs by illustrating their changes when the system reconfigures. Then, we survey existing efforts to represent FSRs within the HVAC sector and adjacent fields, and choose to extend Brick. We introduce the FSBrick architecture and discuss which extensions are added to represent FSRs. To evaluate the coverage of FSBrick, we implement FSBrick on (i) the motivational case study scenario, (ii) Building Automation Systems’ representation of FSRs from 3 HVACs, and (iii) FSRs from 7 FD method papers, and find that FSBrick can represent 88.2% of faults, 87.7% of fault severities, and 72.5% of symptoms. The analyses show that both Brick and FSBrick should be expanded further to cover HVAC component and property information, and mathematical and logical statements used to formulate FSRs in real life and literature. As there is currently no generic and extensible information model to represent FSRs in commercial buildings, FSBrick paves the way to future extensions that would aid the automated revision of FD algorithms upon system reconfiguration.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","69–78","","","","","","","BuildSys '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Istanbul, Turkey","","","","ontology; fault diagnosis; causal relationship; fault-symptom relationships; semantic information modeling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, the availability of digital documentation techniques crucially increased data production, showing the widespread presence of graffiti in Medieval and Early Modern contexts across Europe.However, the approach to historical graffiti has not been yet structured. Guidelines, specific analytical tools, and descriptors are still missing due to various reasons. First, graffiti are a multiform and multimodal graphic expression, so texts, signs, and images must be considered together despite their different communicative nature. Secondly, due to their variety in forms and contents, graffiti have been studied from many perspectives (e.g., epigraphy, palaeography, history, art history, maritime studies), following the specific interests of each scholar. Consequently, the numerous and extensive contributions concerning graffiti highlight the lack of shared standards and approaches, hindering data analysis and interoperability. The panorama emerging is fragmentary and unstructured.This article thus aims to offer a first step toward the development of a specific methodology for the analysis and study of Medieval and Early Modern European graffiti.

We engaged 12 practitioners in individual co-creation workshops, encouraging them to reflect on their ethical role in their everyday work through a series of generative and evaluative activities. We analyzed these data to identify how each practitioner reasoned about ethics through language and artifacts, finding that practitioners used a range of rhetorical tropes to describe their ethical commitments and beliefs in ways that were complex and sometimes contradictory. Across three cases, we describe how ethics was negotiated through language across three key zones of ecological emergence: the practitioners’ “core” beliefs about ethics, internal and external ecological elements that shaped or mediated these core beliefs, and the ultimate boundaries they reported refusing to cross. Building on these findings, we describe how the languaging of ethics reveals opportunities to definitionally and practically engage with ethics in technology ethics research, practice, and education.","2024-06","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ethics; co-creation; languaging; rhetoric; technology practice","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, research on constructing knowledge graph based on DEM remains relatively limited. This study presents a system for constructing knowledge graph based on DEM. In this system, valley and ridge lines are delineated and organized into slope units with distinct boundaries and semantic clarity, refined from DEM. These slope units serve as entities, and their spatial relationships form the connections within the knowledge graph. This system features a user-friendly interface, enabling users to intuitively view terrain data and the knowledge graph. Additionally, it supports natural language Question and Answer (Q&amp;A) functionality, allowing users to query terrain information, explore relationships between slope units, and calculate the shortest paths.

Three encoding methods are investigated to incorporate different kinds of prior knowledge about slots: atomic concepts, slot descriptions, and slot exemplars. The proposed label embeddings tend to share text patterns and reuses data with different slot labels. This makes it useful for adaptive NLU with limited data. Also, since label embedding is independent of NLU model, it is compatible with almost all deep learning based slot filling models. The proposed approaches are evaluated on three datasets. Experiments on single domain and domain adaptation tasks show that label embedding achieves significant performance improvement over traditional one-hot label representation as well as advanced zero-shot approaches.","2020-05","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","1440–1451","","","28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This way, designers can navigate to interesting points in the design space of a generator by describing desired properties of the artifact using a series of natural language descriptors. We present a design methodology that designers can use to develop natural language interfaces for procedural content generation systems.

Given the emergence of building-ESS applications, it has become important to develop ontologies that can cover knowledge about both building and ESS systems. Building systems and ESS systems fall under different industry sectors and there are building ontologies and ESS ontologies that have been developed independently.

The capabilities will be used to compare three goal-oriented modeling languages (i*, NFR-Framework and Secure-Tropos). Method: The framework was created with basis on a conceptual foundation and a conceptual model of privacy built from an analysis of a standard, a regulation, guidelines and other bibliographical sources related to privacy. A health care example is used to illustrate how the framework can be used to compare the chosen modeling languages. Results: Fourteen privacy modeling capabilities were defined in the framework and it was observed that the analyzed modeling languages do not fully support them. Conclusions: The proposed framework contributes towards the consolidation of a privacy conceptual foundation that can be used to evaluate modeling languages for privacy in Requirements Engineering.

UI is of great potential importance since it may be used in a variety of applications where suitable views of ontologies need to be computed. However, this potential can only be fully realized if a highly optimized method for computing such views exists. Previous research has shown that computing uniform interpolants of ELH-ontologies is a computationally extremely hard problem — a finite uniform interpolant does not always exist for ELH, and if it exists, then there exists one of at most triple exponential size in terms of the original ontology, and that, in the worst case, no shorter interpolant exists. Despite the inherent difficulty of the problem, in this paper, we present a highly optimized forgetting method for computing uniform interpolants of ELH-ontologies, and show however that, with good reduction and inference strategies, such uniform interpolants can be efficiently computed. The method is an improvement of the one presented in our previous work.

This treatment is primarily driven by the polarities of the concept names within an ontology.

Therefore, in this short paper, we evaluate how severe the problem of impacting remote changes is in practice by analysing the evolution of real-world ontologies.

This is one of the main goals of recommender systems. However, users’ trust may be compromised if they do not understand how or why the recommendation was achieved. Here, explanations are essential to improve user confidence in recommender systems and to make the recommendation useful. Providing explanation capabilities into recommender systems is not an easy task as their success depends on several aspects such as the explanation’s goal, the user’s expectation, the knowledge available, or the presentation method. Therefore, this work proposes a conceptual model to alleviate this problem by defining the requirements of explanations for recommender systems. Our goal is to provide a model that guides the development of effective explanations for recommender systems as they are correctly designed and suited to the user’s needs. Although earlier explanation taxonomies sustain this work, our model includes new concepts not considered in previous works.

Multilingual probabilistic topic models have recently emerged as a group of semi-supervised machine learning models that can be used to perform thematic explorations on collections of texts in multiple languages. However, these approaches require theme-aligned training data to create a language-independent space. This constraint limits the amount of scenarios that this technique can offer solutions to train and makes it difficult to scale up to situations where a huge collection of multi-lingual documents are required during the training phase. This paper presents an unsupervised document similarity algorithm that does not require parallel or comparable corpora, or any other type of translation resource. The algorithm annotates topics automatically created from documents in a single language with cross-lingual labels and describes documents by hierarchies of multi-lingual concepts from independently-trained models.

Data","","1556-4681","10.1145/3639409","https://doi.org/10.1145/3639409","Topic modelling is a beneficial technique used to discover latent topics in text collections. But to correctly understand the text content and generate a meaningful topic list, semantics are important. By ignoring semantics, that is, not attempting to grasp the meaning of the words, most of the existing topic modelling approaches can generate some meaningless topic words. Even existing semantic-based approaches usually interpret the meanings of words without considering the context and related words. In this article, we introduce a semantic-based topic model called semantic-LDA that captures the semantics of words in a text collection using concepts from an external ontology. A new method is introduced to identify and quantify the concept–word relationships based on matching words from the input text collection with concepts from an ontology without using pre-calculated values from the ontology that quantify the relationships between the words and concepts. These pre-calculated values may not reflect the actual relationships between words and concepts for the input collection, because they are derived from datasets used to build the ontology rather than from the input collection itself. Instead, quantifying the relationship based on the word distribution in the input collection is more realistic and beneficial in the semantic capture process. Furthermore, an ambiguity handling mechanism is introduced to interpret the unmatched words, that is, words for which there are no matching concepts in the ontology. Thus, this article makes a significant contribution by introducing a semantic-based topic model that calculates the word–concept relationships directly from the input text collection. The proposed semantic-based topic model and an enhanced version with the disambiguation mechanism were evaluated against a set of state-of-the-art systems, and our approaches outperformed the baseline systems in both topic quality and information filtering evaluations.","2024-02","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","","","4","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","semantics; Topic modelling; disambiguation; concepts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Capability, Opportunity and Motivation are modeled as latent composite attributes which are composed of observable factors associated with smoking behaviors. Three forms of the COM-B model are proposed to explain the transitions between smoking behaviors: initiating regular smoking uptake, making a quit attempt and quitting successfully.

The constructed 3-D tongue shape is controlled with control points on 2-D midsagittal tongue curve, and speech-driven inverse estimation based on the constructed model is evaluated by empirical data. X-Ray 2-D vocal tract motion videos are tagged for the midsagittal tongue motion, and static 3-D vocal tracts of 20 phonemes are collected with MRI for the realistic 3-D tongue shape. MFCC are calculated from the videos as acoustic features, and are then used in a LSTM-RNN to predict the control points movement of the tongue shape. Three geometrically intuitive control points are selected to represent and calculate the midsagittal line of the tongue through linear regression. Cross-sections on the central lines of the tongues, whose height, width and angle are then predicted from the midsagittal line, are reconstructed with geometric curves, and the shape of each cross-section are then placed on the midsagittal line to get the overall predicted moving grid of the 3-D tongue. In this 3-D tongue model, acoustic features and realistic tongue motion are mapped directly to preserve more realistic articulatory details, and the control points are intuitive for non-experts to control the model, and the geometric tongue shapes predicted are comparable with realistic tongue dynamics.

Additionally, evaluating their learning outcomes comprehensively becomes problematic. Addressing these challenges, we introduce a LLMs-driven BID education method based on a structured ontology and three strategies: enhancing understanding through LLMs-enpowered ""learning by asking"", assisting reasoning by providing hints and feedback, and assessing learning outcomes through benchmarking against existing BID cases. Implementing the method, we developed BIDTrainer, a BID education tool. User studies indicate that learners using BIDTrainer understood BID knowledge better, reason faster with higher interactivity than the baseline, and BIDTrainer assessed the learning outcomes consistent with experts.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","","","","","","","","CHI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Honolulu, HI, USA","","","","Bio-inspired design; Design evaluation; Analogy training; Design education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Datacenter operations are hampered by operational complexity and dynamics, risking to reduce or even offset the performance, energy efficiency, and other datacenter benefits. A promising emerging technology, Operational Data Analytics (ODA), promises to collect and use monitoring data to improve datacenter operations. However, it is challenging to organize, share, and leverage the massive and heterogeneous data resulting from monitoring datacenters. Addressing this combined challenge, starting from the idea that graphs could provide a good abstraction, in this work we present our early work on designing and implementing a graph-based approach for datacenter ODA. We focus on two main components of datacenter ODA. First, we design, implement, and validate agraph-based ontology for datacenters that captures both high-level meta-data information and low-level metrics of operational data collected from real-world datacenters, and maps them to a graph structure for better organization and further use. Second, we design and implementODAbler, a software framework for datacenter ODA, which combines ODA data with an online simulator to make predictions about current operational decisions and other what-if scenarios. We take the first steps to illustrate the practical use of ODAbler, and explore its potential to support datacenter ODA through graph-based analysis.

These inconsistencies need to be identified and shared among engineers to collaboratively resolve them and prevent cascading problems. Despite extensive research in consistency checking, there remains a lack of tools that support collaborative consistency checking (C3). C3 is defined as the process of checking and fixing inconsistencies during collaborative modeling, whether engineers work synchronously or asynchronously. To address this gap, we introduce a prototype tool integrated into the DesignSpace environment which allows collaborative work during modeling and consistency checking.

The semantic difference between two versions of an ontology are the axioms entailed by one version but not the other version, reflecting the evolutionary changes of the content of the ontology. In general, computing such axioms is not computationally feasible, since there are infinitely many of them. UI is an advanced reasoning technique that seeks to create restricted views of ontologies; it provides an effective means for computing a finite representation of the difference between two ontologies. While existing UI methods are designed for languages that are either more expressive or less expressive than the description logic ELH, the underlying language of typical large-scale ontologies, in this paper, we introduce a practical UI method tailored for the task of computing the semantic difference in large-scale ELH-ontologies. The method is terminating, sound, and can always compute UI results possibly including fresh definer symbols. Two case studies on different versions of the SNOMED CT terminology show that the method has overcome major limitations of existing UI methods and can be used to reveal modeling changes that have occurred over successive releases of SNOMED CT.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:01","2025-09-10 14:12:01","","1130–1139","","","","","","","CIKM '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Queensland, Australia","","","","ontologies; knowledge representation and reasoning; forgetting; uniform interpolation; description logics; semantic difference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Moreover, direct schema mappings need often to be re-defined for each new migration instance, in order to accommodate the variations caused by the change of systems and representation conventions. A possible solution to such problems is the use of an intermediate ontological model, that can be used as a lingua franca for the description of schemas, by defining mappings from and to the ontology. While this helps in making explicit the semantics of the schemas, the problem remains on how to extract a direct mapping from source to target schema from this intermediate representation.In this paper, we present our ongoing work in building an ontology-based migration system in the scenario of banking information systems. In the architecture of the system, an ontology defines an intermediate semantic description for the source and target schemas. We introduce a reasoning method for the automatic extraction of migration rules starting from the semantic descriptions of the schemas.

In fields such as sustainability research, discussions about the co-production of knowledge emphasise the involvement of diverse stakeholders in generating relevant information for democratic decision-making processes. Particularly in technology-intensive areas like energy, the voices of experts have traditionally dominated, often marginalising the perspectives of citizens affected by energy policies and leading to epistemic injustices. Social media serves as a central forum for political activity and civic engagement, making it an important research environment for understanding the complexities of knowledge production and sharing. In my dissertation, I explore the opportunities and challenges of integrating citizen voices into the co-production of knowledge through social media using artificial intelligence (AI) based methods. My approach includes analysing stakeholder perspectives across social media, policymakers' speeches, and traditional media, using the discourse on energy justice in the context of sustainable energy transition as empirical material. Additionally, I conduct a comparative analysis of a rule-based ontological classification tool and a large language model (LLM) chatbot as qualitative content analysis tools. I demonstrate that social media data can reveal critical perspectives and marginalised discourses that might otherwise be overlooked. However, social media platforms are also used to spread disinformation and incite polarisation, which undermines their reliability as accurate reflections of prevailing attitudes and opinions in society. In addition, although AI methods can make information processing more effective and support the use of large datasets, it is important to consider their inherent limitations. I address the biases and ethical concerns associated with social media data and AI-based analysis tools and discuss potential solutions to mitigate these challenges.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","701–704","","","","","","","WWW '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sydney NSW, Australia","","","","large language models; natural language processing; social media; computational social sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these issues, we introduce HiPerRAG, a RAG workflow powered by high performance computing (HPC) to index and retrieve knowledge from more than 3.6 million scientific articles. At its core are Oreo, a high-throughput model for multimodal document parsing, and ColTrast, a query-aware encoder fine-tuning algorithm that enhances retrieval accuracy by using contrastive learning and late-interaction techniques. HiPerRAG delivers robust performance on existing scientific question answering (Q/A) benchmarks and two new benchmarks introduced in this work, achieving 90% accuracy on SciQ and 76% on PubMedQA—outperforming both domain-specific models like PubMedGPT and commercial LLMs such as GPT-4.

Whereas in the former area the emphasis was more on designing and implementing concrete repair algorithms, the latter area concentrated on characterizing classes of contraction operations by certain postulates they satisfy. In the classical setting, repairs and contractions are subsets of the knowledge base that no longer have the unwanted consequence. This makes these approaches syntax-dependent and may result in removal of more consequences than necessary. To alleviate this problem, gentle repairs and pseudo-constractions have been introduced in the respective research areas, and their connections have been investigated in recent work. Optimal repairs preserve a maximal amount of consequences, but they may not always exist. We show that, if they exist, then they can be obtained by certain pseudo-contraction operations, and thus they comply with the postulates that these operations satisfy. Conversely, under certain conditions, pseudo-contractions are guaranteed to produce optimal repairs.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","983–990","","","","","","","SAC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tallinn, Estonia","","","","description logic; belief change; ontology repair","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With automated domain modelling support using existing approaches, manual modifications may still be required in extracted domain models and problem descriptions to make them more accurate and concise. For example, educators teaching software engineering courses at universities usually use an incremental approach to build modelling exercises to restrict students in using intended modelling patterns. These modifications result in the evolution of domain modelling exercises over time. To assist practitioners in this evolution, a synergy between interactive support and automated domain modelling is required. In this paper, we propose a bot-assisted approach to allow practitioners perform domain modelling quickly and interactively. Furthermore, we provide an incremental learning strategy empowered by machine learning to improve the accuracy of the bot's suggestions and extracted domain models by analyzing practitioners' decisions over time. We evaluate the performance of our bot using test problem descriptions which shows that practitioners can expect to get useful support from the bot when applied to exercises of similar size and complexity, with precision, recall, and F2 scores over 85%. Finally, we evaluate our incremental learning strategy where we observe a reduction in the required manual modifications by 70% and an improvement of F2 scores of extracted domain models by 4.2% when using our proposed approach and learning strategy together.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","176–186","","","","","","","MODELS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","evolution; natural language processing (NLP); bot; decisions; domain models; incremental learning; machine learning (ML)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To do so, we identify the most frequently cited and best-validated human-machine and human-robot trust questionnaires as well as the best-established factors that form the dimensions and antecedents of such trust. To reduce both confusion and construct proliferation, we provide a detailed mapping of terminology between questionnaires. Furthermore, we perform a meta-analysis of the regression models which emerged from the experiments that employed multi-factorial survey instruments. Based on this meta-analysis, we provide the most complete, experimentally validated model of human-machine and human-robot trust to date. This convergent model establishes an integrated framework for future research. It determines the current boundaries of trust measurement and where further investigation and validation are necessary. We close by discussing how to choose an appropriate trust survey instrument and how to design for trust.

A widely-investigated OMQA technique is FO-rewriting: every query asked on a KB is reformulated w.r.t. the KB's ontology, so that its answers are computed by the relational evaluation of the query reformulation on the KB's database. Crucially, because FO-rewriting compiles the domain knowledge relevant to queries into their reformulations, query reformulations may be complex and their optimization is the crux of efficiency. We devise a novel optimization framework for a large set of OMQA settings that enjoy FO-rewriting: conjunctive queries, i.e., the core select-project-join queries, asked on KBs expressed using datalog+/-, description logics, existential rules, OWL, or RDFS. We optimize the query reformulations produced by state-of-the-art FO-rewriting algorithms by computing rapidly, with the help of a KB's database summary, simpler (contained) queries with the same answers that can be evaluated faster by RDBMSs. We show on a well-established OMQA benchmark that time performance is significantly improved by our optimization framework in general, up to three orders of magnitude.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","2138–2148","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","data summarization; existential rules; query optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"QIKYBUD2","book","2024","","ASPLOS '24: Proceedings of the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems, Volume 3","","979-8-4007-0386-7","","","","Welcome to the third volume of ASPLOS'24: the 29th ACM International Conference on Architectural Support for Programming Languages and Operating Systems. This document is mostly dedicated to the 2024 fall cycle but also provides some statistics summarizing all three cycles.We introduced several notable changes to ASPLOS this year, most of which were discussed in our previous messages from program chairs in Volume 1 and 2, including: (1) significantly increasing the program committee size to over 220 members (more than twice the size of last year); (2) foregoing synchronous program committee (PC) meetings and instead making all decisions online; (3) overhauling the review assignment process; (4) developing an automated submission format violation identifier script that uncovers, e.g., disallowed vertical space manipulations that ""squeeze"" space; (5) introducing the new ASPLOS role of Program Vice Chairs to cope with the increased number of submissions and the added load caused by foregoing synchronous program committee; and (6) characterizing a systematic problem that ASPLOS is facing in reviewing quantum computing submissions, describing how we addressed it and highlighting how we believe that it should be handled in the future.Assuming readers have read our previous messages, here, we will only describe differences between the current cycle and the previous ones. These include: (1) Finally unifying submission and acceptance paper formatting instructions (forgoing the `jpaper' class) to rid authors of accepted papers from the need to reformat; (2) Describing the methodology we employed to select best papers, which we believe ensures quality and hope will persist; and (3) Reporting the ethical incidents we encountered and how we handled them. In the final, fourth volume, when the outcome of the ASPLOS'24 fall major revisions will become known, we plan to conduct a broader analysis of all the data we have gathered throughout the year.Following are some key statistics of the fall cycle: 340 submissions were finalized (43% more than last year's fall count and 17% less than our summer cycle) of which 111 are related to accelerators/FPGAs/GPUs, 105 to machine learning, 54 to security, 50 to datacenter/cloud and 50 to storage/memory; 183 (54%) submissions were promoted to the second review round; 39 (11.5%) papers were accepted (of which 19 were awarded artifact evaluation badges); 33 (9.7%) submissions were allowed to submit major revisions and are currently under review (these will be addressed in the fourth volume of ASPLOS'24 and will be presented in ASPLOS'25 if accepted); 1,368 reviews were uploaded; and 4,949 comments were generated during online discussions, of which 4,070 were dedicated to the submissions that made it to the second review round.This year, in the submission form, we asked authors to specify which of the three ASPLOS research areas are related to their submitted work. Analyzing this data revealed that 80%, 39%, and 29% of the submissions are categorized by their authors as related to architecture, operating systems, and programming languages, respectively, generating the highest difference we have observed across the cycles between architecture and the other two. About 46% of the fall submissions are ""interdisciplinary,"" namely, were associated with two or more of the three areas.Overall, throughout all the ASPLOS'24 cycles, we received 922 submissions, constituting a 1.54x increase compared to last year. Our reviewers submitted a total of 3,634 reviews containing more than 2.6 million words, and we also generated 12,655 online comments consisting of nearly 1.2 million words. As planned, PC members submitted an average of 15.7 reviews and a median of 15, and external review committee (ERC) members submitted an average of 4.7 and a median of 5.We accepted 170 papers thus far, written by 1100 authors, leading to an 18.4% acceptance rate, with the aforementioned 33 major revisions still under review. Assuming that the revision acceptance rate will be similar to that of previous cycles, we estimate that ASPLOS'24 will accept nearly 200 (!) papers, namely, 21%–22% of the submissions.The ASPLOS'24 program consists of 193 papers: the 170 papers we accepted thus far and, in addition, 23 major revisions from the fall cycle of ASPLOS'23, which were re-reviewed and accepted. The full details are available in the PDF of the front matter.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","","","","3","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The present article seeks to introduce a novel procedure to design the traffic lights in a city using evolutionary-based optimization algorithms in combination with an ontology-based driving behavior simulation framework. Accordingly, an ontology-based knowledge base is introduced to provide a machine-understandable knowledge of roads and intersections, traffic rules, and driving behaviors. Then, a simulation environment is developed to inspect car behavior in real time. To optimize the traffic lights, a sine-based equation was defined for each traffic light, and the total travel time of the vehicles was considered as the cost function in the optimization algorithm. The optimization was performed with 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 vehicles in the urban areas. Based on the results, in contrast to uncontrolled intersections without traffic lights, optimized traffic lights can significantly contribute to total travel time-saving. To conclude, due to an escalation in the number of vehicles, the significance of optimized traffic lights has encountered an increase, and unoptimized traffic lights could increase total travel time even more than a city deprived of any traffic light.","2023-03","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; knowledge representation; autonomous car; driving behavior; Evolutionary optimization; traffic light","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Then, based on this knowledge base, a training set was annotated, and the UIE model was fine-tuned using this training set. The fine-tuned UIE model was then used to extract medical history knowledge, which was processed and stored to generate a KG of medical histories. Results: The fine-tuned UIE model achieved entity, relationship, and event extraction tasks. Subsequently, the extracted medical history information was processed and stored, successfully constructing a KG of the current medical history. Conclusion: This method realizes the completion of entity, relation, and event extraction tasks by training only one model, efficiently achieving automatic extraction of specified medical history knowledge from Chinese electronic medical records and constructing a KG of medical histories.

Res.","","1076-9757","10.1613/jair.1.13939","https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.13939","This paper is concerned with knowledge graph embedding with background knowledge, taking the formal perspective of logics. In knowledge graph embedding, knowledge— expressed as a set of triples of the form (a R b) (“a is R-related to b”)—is embedded into a real-valued vector space. The embedding helps exploiting geometrical regularities of the space in order to tackle typical inductive tasks of machine learning such as link prediction. Recent embedding approaches also consider incorporating background knowledge, in which the intended meanings of the symbols a, R, b are further constrained via axioms of a theory. Of particular interest are theories expressed in a formal language with a neat semantics and a good balance between expressivity and feasibility. In that case, the knowledge graph together with the background can be considered to be an ontology. This paper develops a cone-based theory for embedding in order to advance the expressivity of the ontology: it works (at least) with ontologies expressed in the description logic ALC, which comprises restricted existential and universal quantifiers, as well as concept negation and concept disjunction. In order to align the classical Tarskian Style semantics for ALC with the sub-symbolic representation of triples, we use the notion of a geometric model of an ALC ontology and show, as one of our main results, that an ALC ontology is satisfiable in the classical sense iff it is satisfiable by a geometric model based on cones. The geometric model, if treated as a partial model, can even be chosen to be faithful, i.e., to reflect all and only the knowledge captured by the ontology. We introduce the class of axis-aligned cones and show that modulo simple geometric operations any distributive logic (such as ALC) interpreted over cones employs this class of cones. Cones are also attractive from a machine learning perspective on knowledge graph embeddings since they give rise to applying conic optimization techniques.","2024-01","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","","","","78","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: El Segundo, CA, USA Publisher: AI Access Foundation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing methods commonly train models from scratch. As a consequence, substantial data and computational resources are required to make the randomly initialized model comprehend sound events and perform separation accordingly. In this paper, we propose to integrate pre-trained models into TSE models to address the above issue.

CLAPSep also accepts flexible user inputs, taking both positive and negative user prompts of uni- and/or multi-modalities for target sound extraction. These key features of CLAPSep can not only enhance the extraction performance but also improve the versatility of its application.

As shown from the evaluation, the ICARUS ontology enables the integration and reasoning over multiple sources of heterogeneous aviation-related data, the semantic description of metadata produced by ICARUS, and their storage in a knowledge-base which is dynamically updated and provides access to its contents via SPARQL queries.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","21–32","","","","","","","WIMS 2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Biarritz, France","","","","ontology; services; queries; datasets; aviation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As an example, food price datasets may contain product prices of various units at different markets and times, and different providers can have many choices of formats such as CSV, JSON or spreadsheet. Beyond data formats, these datasets may have differing layout, where one dataset may be organized as a row-based table or relational table (prices are in one column), while another may use a matrix table (prices are in one matrix). To address these problems, we present a novel data description language for mapping datasets to RDF. In particular, our language supports specifying the locations of source attributes in the sources, mapping of the attributes to ontologies, and simple rules to join the data of these attributes to output final RDF triples. Unlike existing approaches, our language is not restricted to specific data layouts such as the Nested Relational Model, or to specific data formats, such as spreadsheet. Our broad data description language presents a format-independent solution, allowing interlinking among multiple heterogeneous sources and representing many diverse data structures that existing tools are unable to handle.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","189–196","","","","","","","K-CAP '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Marina Del Rey, CA, USA","","","","knowledge graph; linked data; rdf mapping","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Forming an ontology requires several years of work performed by human experts, and an ontology for a given domain is thought to be stable for many years. Nevertheless, as scientific articles are continuously published to gather knowledge on recent findings, existing ontologies risk becoming stale, or require further human effort. Moreover, searching new articles without referring to an ontology can be very time consuming and confusing, especially for novice researchers. We propose an approach for automatically relating newly available published articles to existing ontologies. By automatically selecting relevant scientific articles and making them appear besides other data in an ontology, we aim at supporting experienced and novice researchers. Therefore, as knowledge grows and articles are available, the ontology used by researchers will also be automatically connected, allowing them to readily discover new findings. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we have enriched OBIB, an ontology for biobanking, with a selection of articles extracted from PubMed.

Besides, there is another approach to POS tagging which has been applied to English, namely the approach using ontology. This approach has not yet been applied to Bahasa Indonesia so we will implement an ontology to conduct POS tagging in Bahasa Indonesia. In this study, the ontology was constructed using the Word2Vec and the DBSCAN clustering method. The Word2Vec model is implemented to extract each word in vector form based on its context and the DBSCAN clustering method is implemented for the classification process of word classes based on word vectors modeled by Word2Vec. The process of POS tagging with ontology is carried out in several stages, namely: data collection using web scraping techniques from Kompas.com and Detik.com online news articles, text preprocessing, Word2Vec feature building, clustering with DBSCAN, ontology construction and evaluation. The experiments carried out in this study were to choose the optimal parameter values from DBSCAN in forming word clusters for ontology construction. Overall, the implementation of ontology with Word2Vec and DBSCAN can do POS tagging with the highest accuracy value of 0.62, the highest precision value of 0.79, the highest recall value of 0.62, and the highest f1-score of 0.67.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","51–56","","","","","","","SIET '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Malang, Indonesia","","","","ontology; DBSCAN; Word2Vec; POS tagging; bahasa indonesia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Specifically, an entity in the graph can be assigned with multiple meanings while two or more entities considered to have different meanings may actually be the same. Assigning an entity with the correct meaning may involve re-evaluation of its relevant contexts. This costly operation typically involves searching for other similar entities within the KG such that the context can be determined. In this article, a new model called DisambiguART is proposed leveraging multi-channel matching and inference in a self-organizing neural network for sense disambiguation in KGs. Unlike other disambiguation methods that rely on representation learning to identify the relevant contexts whereby similarities among entities are learned, DisambiguART extends the working principle of multi-channel Adaptive Resonance Theory (ART) to conduct inferences directly over the graph representation through bi-directional interactions of bottom-up activations and top-down matching to find similar entities and select the correct meaning according to the right context. The proposed method is evaluated on the tasks of entity sense disambiguation in three domain KGs (jet engine, biomedical, and kinship) and author name disambiguation in bibliographic KGs, demonstrating the effectiveness and efficiency of DisambiguART against the state-of-the-art methods.","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Knowledge Graphs; Adaptive Resonance Theory; Entity Disambiguation; Graph Embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Implementing the appropriate analysis for a compiler optimization is a time consuming activity. For example, in LLVM, tens of thousands of lines of code are required to detect appropriate places to apply peephole optimizations. It is a barrier to the rapid prototyping and evaluation of new optimizations. In this paper we present the Compiler Analysis Description Language (CAnDL), a domain specific language for compiler analysis. CAnDL is a constraint based language that operates over LLVM's intermediate representation. The compiler developer writes a CAnDL program, which is then compiled by the CAnDL compiler into a C++ LLVM pass. It provides a uniform manner in which to describe compiler analysis and can be applied to a range of compiler analysis problems, reducing code length and complexity. We implemented and evaluated CAnDL on a number of real world use cases: eliminating redundant operations; graphics code optimization; identifying static control flow regions. In all cases were we able to express the analysis more briefly than competing approaches.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:02","2025-09-10 14:12:02","","151–162","","","","","","","CC '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","constraint programming; optimization; LLVM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the non-interpretability and lack of specifications of the Learning-Enabled Component (LEC) used in ASs make this mission particularly challenging. Some existing DDM techniques overcome these limitations by using probabilistic environmental perception knowledge associated with predicting behavior changes for the agents in the environment. Ontology-based methods allow using a formal and traceable representation of AS usage scenarios to support the design process of the DDM component of such ASs. This paper presents a methodology to perform this design process, starting from the AS specification stage and including threat analysis and requirements identification. The present paper focuses on the formalization of an ontology modeling language allowing the interpretation of logical usage scenarios, i.e., a formal description of the scenario represented by state variables. The proposed supervisory system also considers the uncertainty estimation and interaction between AS components through the whole perception-planning-control pipeline.

There still remains a gap in domain and language adaptation of these QAG models to low-resource languages such as Vietnamese. To address the gap, this article presents a large-scale and systematic study of QAG in Vietnamese. To do that, we first implement several QAG models by using the common fine-tuning techniques based on powerful pre-trained language models. We next introduce a set of instructions designed for the QAG task. These instructions are used to fine-tuned the pre-trained language and large language models. Extensive experimental results of both automatic and human evaluation on five benchmark machine reading comprehension datasets show two important points. First, the instruction-tuning method has the potential to enhance the performance of QAG models. Second, large language models trained in English need more data for fine-tuning to work well on the downstream QAG tasks of low-resource languages. We also provide a prototype system to demonstrate how our QAG models actually work.

However, the ""minimalism"" of the ontology has yet to be explored to cover pandemic settings. Responding to this, modelers must redesign services that are Covid-19 safe and better reflect changing realities.

We propose Configuration Intent Summarization (CIS), a new task that aims to automate this process by generating human-readable summaries of the intents embedded across a network's configurations. CIS is challenging due to the diversity of intents, the semantic gap between device-specific configurations and network-wide intents, and the need to reason about interactions between multiple devices' configurations. We present ConfSum, a system that addresses these challenges by leveraging the unique ability of large language models (LLMs) to parse semi-structured configuration files and summarize them in natural language. However, the full CIS task requires reasoning about device interactions and other complexities that are beyond the capabilities of LLMs alone. To enhance the LLM's robustness to these challenges, ConfSum introduces novel techniques for retrieving relevant examples to augment LLM prompts, decomposing the generation process to handle multi-device intents, and integrating with formal validation tools.

Aspect-based sentiment classification is the subtask that seeks to detect the sentiment expressed by the content creators towards a defined target within a sentence. This paper introduces three novel unsupervised attentional neural network models for aspect-based sentiment classification, and tests them on English restaurant reviews. The first model employs an autoencoder-like structure to learn a sentiment embedding matrix where each row of the matrix represents the embedding for one sentiment. To improve the model, a target-based attention mechanism is included that de-emphasizes irrelevant words. Last, a redundancy and a seed regularization term constrain the sentiment embedding matrix. The second model extends the first by including a Bi-LSTM layer in the attention mechanism to exploit contextual information. The third model further adapts a Left-Center-Right separated neural network with Rotatory attention structure from the supervised realm to an unsupervised setting. Although all three models construct meaningful sentiment embeddings, experimental results indicate that the inclusion of the Bi-LSTM in the attention mechanism leads to a more precise attention mechanism and, thus, better predictions. The best model, i.e., the second, outperforms all investigated unsupervised and weakly supervised algorithms for aspect-based sentiment classification from the literature.","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","5–17","","2","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","unsupervised learning; aspect-based sentiment classification; attentional neural model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the impact of generative AI extends well beyond academia, as corporations and public interest organizations have begun integrating these models into their data science pipelines. We expand this lens to include the impact of open models on organizations, focusing specifically on fact-checking organizations, which use AI to observe and analyze large volumes of circulating misinformation, yet must also ensure the reproducibility and impartiality of their work. We wanted to understand where fact-checking organizations use open models in their data science pipelines; what motivates their use of open models or proprietary models; and how their use of open or proprietary models can inform research on the societal impact of generative AI. To answer these questions, we conducted an interview study with N=24 professionals at 20 fact-checking organizations on six continents. Based on these interviews, we offer a five-component conceptual model of where fact-checking organizations employ generative AI to support or automate parts of their data science pipeline, including Data Ingestion, Data Analysis, Data Retrieval, Data Delivery, and Data Sharing. We then provide taxonomies of fact-checking organizations' motivations for using open models and the limitations that prevent them for further adopting open models, finding that they prefer open models for Organizational Autonomy, Data Privacy and Ownership, Application Specificity, and Capability Transparency. However, they nonetheless use proprietary models due to perceived advantages in Performance, Usability, and Safety, as well as Opportunity Costs related to participation in emerging generative AI ecosystems. Finally, we propose a research agenda to address limitations of both open and proprietary models.

Recent studies have shown language-universal features can bridge the gap between languages.

The proposed encoder is capable of interactively capturing complementary information between features and contextual information, to derive language-agnostic representations for various cross-lingual IE tasks. Concretely, a multi-level interaction network is designed to hierarchically interact the complementary information to strengthen domain adaptability. Besides, in addition to the well-studied word-level syntax features of part-of-speech and dependency relation, a new span-level syntax feature of constituency structure is introduced to model the constituent span information which is crucial for IE. Experiments across seven languages on three IE tasks and four benchmarks verify the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed method.","2024-10","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","4795–4809","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Problem: The existence of semantic anomalies (use of rhetorical language, polysemy and inaccuracies) in the Brazilian Legal Domain enables the use of Semantic Web standards and technologies to mitigate these problems. Solution: This work deals with the development of an Information System that uses resources from the Semantic Web for the formal representation and the realization of legal inferences about Crimes Against Property.

Method: Bibliographic and documentary research methods were used to list the main concepts related to the Criminal Types investigated. The research is prescriptive and has a quali-quantitative approach. Summary of Results: A prototype system is presented, integrating ontologies of Brazilian Law with a chatbot that enables interaction with users in natural language, as well as performing reasoning tasks based on the knowledge formalized in these ontologies. Contributions and Impact in the IS area: The research will contribute to the automation of decision-making processes involving crimes against property, serving as an aid for professionals or law students and for legal simulations by ordinary people.

We show that a naive combination of these models invalidates the guarantees they normally provide, thereby breaking the assumptions of programmers. Hence, we present Chocola: a unified language of futures, transactions, and actors that maintains the guarantees of all three models wherever possible, even when they are combined.We describe and formalize the semantics of this language and prove the guarantees it provides.

The demands of the DM process for information organization and management have raised issues that the CnR community attempts to solve by creating DM-support tools and systems, which, among others, exploit Semantic Web (SW) technologies. Regarding the tools and systems that focus on the DM process of selecting an intervention option (CnR-DM-I), they present benefits, as well as limitations, regarding the (1) completeness of representation of the relevant knowledge in a unified manner, (2) facilitation of recording the CnR-DM-I process per se, in terms of the problem at hand as well as the intervention parameters, requirements, and criteria, and (3) recommendation and further exploration of CnR intervention options in a systematic manner. This work proposes an ontology-based framework as a means to overcome those limitations. The proposed framework (DS-CnRI) sets at its core a formal ontology which provides the necessary entities to represent expert knowledge related to CnR-DM-I. The ontology also includes rules which provide useful inferences to assist the CnR-DM-I process. The proposed framework has been deployed and evaluated in collaboration with conservators. Initial evaluation results show that the framework assists conservators in CnR-DM-I to detect and select the most suitable intervention options, to better understand the limitations of different options, and to document the process of reaching their decision.","2024-05","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","knowledge representation; conservation; cultural heritage; Decision-support services; restoration; semantic Web technologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there is no consensus on the quality characteristics and subcharacteristics of embedded software. This article presents the steps for modeling an operational quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series of quality models for traditional computer systems. From a literature review composed of 40 studies on quality modeling for embedded systems and software, 85 of the most frequent quality characteristics and subcharacteristics were first identified, including a subset of 16 referenced or cited in at least 25% of the literature. Next, the design of a quality model for embedded software aligned with the ISO 25000 series was proposed with 13 characteristics and 27 subcharacteristics. The operational aspect of this quality model for embedded software is addressed next through a set of measures and measurement functions from ISO 25000 to aggregate the results of the quantification of the characteristics and subcharacteristics. A survey involving 25 embedded software specialists is presented next to gauge, using Fleiss's Kappa criteria, their agreement with the proposed quality model. Furthermore, the computed importance weights derived from the survey participants’ individual opinions were compared with those derived from an analysis of 40 embedded software studies, bolstering the credibility of the model. The results of this study suggest that the proposed quality model can serve as a framework for evaluating and understanding the quality characteristics across diverse expertise levels. Furthermore, the convergence between the survey and the literature strengthens the model's credibility by anchoring it in both established literature and practitioners’ agreements.","2024-11","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","1","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Quality model; ISO; measure; qualimetry; quality characteristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Significant progress has been made in algorithm development and resource construction for computational phenotyping. Among the surveyed methods, well-designed keyword search and rule-based systems often achieve good performance. However, the construction of keyword and rule lists requires significant manual effort, which is difficult to scale. Supervised machine learning models have been favored because they are capable of acquiring both classification patterns and structures from data. Recently, deep learning and unsupervised learning have received growing attention, with the former favored for its performance and the latter for its ability to find novel phenotypes. Integrating heterogeneous data sources have become increasingly important and have shown promise in improving model performance.

Since the emerging developing of ontologies, several studies have proposed criteria to evaluate them. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of practical and reproducible guidelines to drive a comparative evaluation of ontologies as a systematic process. In this paper, we propose a methodological process to qualitatively and quantitatively compare ontologies at Lexical, Structural, and Domain Knowledge levels, considering Correctness and Quality perspectives.

In our own precision farming project aimed at decision support for dairy cow management, we mine for knowledge in milk production data. In one task, we aim at contrast patterns explaining the relative impact of independent production factors. To that end, ontologically-generalized graph patterns (OGPs), a variety of generalized graph patterns, where vertices and edges are labelled by DO classes and properties, respectively, were defined. A mining methodology was also designed that reconciles OWL DOs, abstraction from RDF graphs and literals in data. To address the well-known cost-related limitations of graph mining -exacerbated here by class/property specializations and data properties- we split the mining task into (1) mining of generic object property topology patterns and (2) label refinement.

The resulting contexts allow for the representation of dimensions, and multidimensional data quality assessment becomes possible. At the core of a multidimensional context, we include a generalized multidimensional data model and a Datalog± ontology with provably good properties in terms of query answering. These main components are used to represent dimension hierarchies, dimensional constraints, and dimensional rules and define predicates for quality data specification. Query answering relies on and triggers navigation through dimension hierarchies and becomes the basic tool for the extraction of quality data. The OMD model is interesting per se beyond applications to data quality. It allows for a logic-based and computationally tractable representation of multidimensional data, extending previous multidimensional data models with additional expressive power and functionalities.","2018-01","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","3","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ontology-based data access; Datalog±; query answering; weakly-sticky programs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this, Probabilistic Knowledge Graphs (P-KGs) associate axioms with confidence scores, capturing the uncertainty of their truthfulness. We propose Stat-n-Ball, a novel R-KGE framework that incorporates confidence scores by representing axioms' certainty as overlapping volumes between entities in vector space. Our approach enhances the geometric representation of KGs, enabling accurate link prediction and confidence estimation in probabilistic settings. Experimental evaluations on standard P-KG datasets demonstrate that Stat-n-Ball achieves atleast a 2× improvement in entity association detection and a minimum 5% reduction in confidence prediction error compared to state-of-the-art models.

This has resulted in a multiplication of ad-hoc architectures and tools specialized for a single pair of VML and solver, fragmenting the SPL community. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel architecture based on model-driven code generation, where the syntax and semantics of VMLs can be declaratively specified as data, and a standard, human-readable, formal pivot language is used between the VML and the solver input language. This architecture is the first to be fully generic by being agnostic to both VML and the solver paradigm. To validate the genericity of the approach, we have implemented a prototype tool together with declarative specifications for the syntax and semantics of two different VMLs and two different solver families. One VML is for classic, static SPL, and the other for run-time reconfigurable dynamic SPL with soft constraints to be optimized during configuration. The two solver families are Constraint Satisfaction Programs (CSP) and Constraint Logic Programs (CLP).","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","138–152","","","","","","","GPCE 2023","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cascais, Portugal","","","","Automated Reasoning; Software Product Lines; Configuration Automation; Generic Architecture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper introduces two novel unsupervised attentional neural network models for aspect-based sentiment classification, and tests them on English restaurant reviews. The first model employs an autoencoder-like structure to learn a sentiment embedding matrix where each row of the matrix represents the embedding for one sentiment. To improve the model, a target-based attention mechanism is included that de-emphasizes irrelevant words. Last, a redundancy and a seed regularization term constrain the sentiment embedding matrix. The second model extends the first by including a Bi-LSTM layer in the attention mechanism to exploit contextual information. Although both models construct meaningful sentiment embeddings, experimental results indicate that the inclusion of the Bi-LSTM in the attention mechanism leads to a more precise attention mechanisms and, thus, better predictions. The best model, i.e., the second, outperforms all investigated unsupervised and weakly supervised algorithms for aspect-based sentiment classification from the literature.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","2069–2077","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, such as migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is, and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grain level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML that fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.","2018-02","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","1","51","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","modeling; Cloud computing; domain-specific languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These ontologies are often manually curated (e.g., UMLS, SNOMED CT, and MeSH) by medical experts. Medical databases, on the other hand, are often created by database administrators, using different terminology and structures. The discrepancies between medical ontologies and databases compromise interoperability between them. Data to ontology matching is the process of finding semantic correspondences between tables in databases to standard ontologies. Existing solutions such as ontology matching have mostly focused on engineering features from terminological, structural, and semantic model information extracted from the ontologies. However, this is often labor intensive and the accuracy varies greatly across different ontologies. Worse yet, the ontology capturing a medical database is often not given in practice. In this paper, we propose MEDTO, a novel end-to-end framework that consists of three innovative techniques: (1) a lightweight yet effective method that bootstrap a semantically rich ontology from a given medical database, (2) a hyperbolic graph convolution layer that encodes hierarchical concepts in the hyperbolic space, and (3) a heterogeneous graph layer that encodes both local and global context information of a concept. Experiments on two real-world medical datasets matching against SNOMED CT show significant improvements compared to the state-of-the-art methods. MEDTO also consistently achieves competitive results on a benchmark from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","2946–2954","","","","","","","KDD '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Singapore","","","","ontology matching; graph neural network; medical data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a significant drawback of neural networks is the lack of explainability and interpretability — it is hard to say why a neural network arrived to a certain conclusion. This significantly limits application of neural networks in critical tasks and undermines trust in human-AI collaboration. It has been recently shown that internal representations constructed by a neural network can often be aligned with a domain ontology. This opens a promising way to provide explanations of a neural network in human terms. In this paper, we discuss the results of the experiment aimed at understanding what layers of a neural network are the most perspective for the alignment with given ontology concept. To do so, we build concept localization maps for XTRAINS — a synthetic dataset consisting of images and their ontological annotations. The importance of such maps is that they can be used for the development of efficient concept alignment heuristics. The experiment mostly supports the intuition that high-level concepts are localized mostly in the activations of last layers of a neural network (near its head), while lower-level concepts might be better extracted from middle layers.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","82–87","","","","","","","SoICT '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hanoi, Vietnam","","","","ontologies; XAI; neural networks; explainable AI; neuro-symbolic intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Natural language processing (NLP) techniques provide an opportunity to extract and explore meaningful information from a large amount of text. Among natural languages, Urdu is one of the widely used languages worldwide for spoken and written communications. Due to its wide adopt-ability, digital content in the Urdu language is increasing briskly, especially with social media and online NEWS feeds. Government agencies and advertisers must filter and understand the content to analyze the trends and cohorts in their interest and national prerogative. Clustering is considered a baseline and one of the first steps in natural language understanding. There are many state-of-the-art clustering techniques specifically for English, French, and Arabic, but no significant research has been conducted in Urdu language processing. Doing it for short text segments is challenging because of limited features and the absence of meaningful language discourse and nuance. Many rule-based NLP techniques are adopted to overcome these issues, relying on human-designed features and rules. Therefore, these methods do not promise remarkable results. Alongside NLP, deep learning techniques are pretty efficient in capturing contextual information with minimal noise compared to other traditional methods. By taking on this challenging job, we develop a deep learning-based technique for Urdu short text clustering for the very first time without a human-designed feature. In this paper, we propose a method of short text clustering using a deep neural network that automatically learns feature representations and clustering assignments simultaneously. This method learns clustering objectives by converting the high dimensional feature space to a low dimensional feature space.

This makes knowledge transfer a challenging issue due to the lack of a common conceptualization about HCI design, leading to semantic interoperability problems, such as ambiguity and imprecision when interpreting shared information. Ontologies have been acknowledged as a successful approach to represent domain knowledge and support knowledge-based solutions. Hence, in this work, we propose to explore the use of ontologies to represent structured knowledge of HCI design and improve knowledge sharing in this context.

The scientific social networks in their current form depend on the title, the keywords, and the ontology to compare and link the relationship between different scientific research; there may be different scientific research with the same keywords; the same scientific research may have different titles. In addition, scientific research may be written in different languages, but current scientific social networks do not take into account the multiple languages of researchers and research. they cannot link the relationship and compare scientific research written in different languages. To solve these problems, this paper proposes the use of a multi-lingual ontology to determine and describe scientific research. This work uses ontology in the context of a conceptual indexation, by separating the concept from the term, thus, the result of this work according to the proposed approach will make it possible to express the concept (knowledge extra-linguistic), in different languages, this will allow comparing and linking the relationship between scientific research written in different languages and measuring the percentage of similarity and difference between them.

However, CQs have to be translated into a formal language, like ontology query language (SPARQL-OWL), to query the ontology. Since the translation step is time-consuming and requires familiarity with the query language used, in this paper, we propose an automatic method named SeeQuery, which recommends SPARQL-OWL queries being translations of CQs stated against a given ontology.

These documents are typically very long and tend to contain valuable soft information about a company’s performance that is not present in quantitative predictors. It is therefore of great interest to learn predictive models from these long textual documents, especially for forecasting numerical key performance indicators. In recent years, there has been great progress in natural language processing via pre-trained language models (LMs) learned from large corpora of textual data. This prompts the important question of whether they can be used effectively to produce representations for long documents, as well as how we can evaluate the effectiveness of representations produced by various LMs. Our work focuses on answering this critical question, namely, the evaluation of the efficacy of various LMs in extracting useful soft information from long textual documents for prediction tasks. In this article, we propose and implement a deep learning evaluation framework that utilizes a sequential chunking approach combined with an attention mechanism. We perform an extensive set of experiments on a collection of 10-K reports submitted annually by U.S. banks, and another dataset of reports submitted by U.S. companies, to investigate thoroughly the performance of different types of language models. Overall, our framework using LMs outperforms strong baseline methods for textual modeling as well as for numerical regression. Our work provides better insights into how utilizing pre-trained domain-specific and fine-tuned long-input LMs for representing long documents can improve the quality of representation of textual data and, therefore, help in improving predictive analyses.","2024-06","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","7","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","language models; 10-K reports; financial documents; long text documents; Text regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our main concern is first-order rewritability of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) that consist of a 2D ontology and a positive temporal instance query. Our target languages for FO-rewritings are two-sorted FO(&lt;) – first-order logic with sorts for time instants ordered by the built-in precedence relation &lt; and for the domain of individuals—its extension FO(&lt;, ≡) with the standard congruence predicates t ≡ 0 (mod n), for any fixed n &gt; 1, and FO(RPR) that admits relational primitive recursion. In terms of circuit complexity, FO(&lt;, ≡)- and FO(RPR)-rewritability guarantee answering OMQs in uniform AC0 and NC1, respectively. We proceed in three steps. First, we define a hierarchy of 2D DL-Lite/LTL ontology languages and investigate the FO-rewritability of OMQs with atomic queries by constructing projections onto 1D LTL OMQs and employing recent results on the FO-rewritability of propositional LTL OMQs. As the projections involve deciding consistency of ontologies and data, we also consider the consistency problem for our languages. While the undecidability of consistency for 2D ontology languages with expressive Boolean role inclusions might be expected, we also show that, rather surprisingly, the restriction to Krom and Horn role inclusions leads to decidability (and ExpSpace-completeness), even if one admits full Booleans on concepts. As a final step, we lift some of the rewritability results for atomic OMQs to OMQs with expressive positive temporal instance queries. The lifting results are based on an in-depth study of the canonical models and only concern Horn ontologies.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:03","2025-09-10 14:12:03","","","","","75","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: El Segundo, CA, USA Publisher: AI Access Foundation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In an effort to realize adaptive ontology visualization, this paper presents a potential solution to predict a user's likely success and failure in real time, and prior to task completion, by applying established machine learning models on eye gaze generated during an interactive session. These predictions are envisioned to inform future adaptive ontology visualizations that could potentially adjust its visual cues or recommend alternative visualizations in real time to improve individual user success.

These situations are ubiquitous in learning problems on the web and in science, where rich domain models are developed but labeled data is rare. Most existing solutions model the problem as a sequence of simpler problems: one classifier for each level in the hierarchy, or one classifier for each label. These approaches require more training data, which is often unavailable in practice: as the ontology grows in size and complexity, it becomes unlikely to find training examples for all expected combinations. In this paper, we learn offline representations of the ontology using a graph autoencoder and separately learn to classify input records, reducing dependence on training data: Since the relationships between labels are encoded independently of training data, the model can make predictions even for underrepresented labels, naturally generalize to DAG-structured ontologies, remain robust to low-data regimes, and, with minor offline retraining, tolerate evolving ontologies. We show empirically that our label predictions respect the hierarchy (predicting a descendant implies predicting its ancestors) and propose a method of evaluating hierarchy violations that properly ignores irrelevant violations.

Multi-source heterogeneous data is used to construct the dataset, which contains numerical data on stock fundamentals and technical aspects, and text data on information aspects, which collects investor comments during a moving window period. Expert knowledge is used to mark the emotional polarity of the text in the batch. The constructed text-only model aims to reveal the implicit relationship between the comment texts. To quantify the emotional tendency of massive stock investors on a given day, the Bert/ Enhanced Representation through Knowledge Integration (ERNIE) of word embedding method and the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)/ Deep Pyramid-CNN (DPCNN)/ Region-CNN (RCNN) classifier are used models. Model I (CEEMDAN-WOA-BiLSTM) analyses unidimensional stock closing prices and interprets stock price fluctuations as digital signals, whereas Model II (CCAM-Attention-BiLSTM based on Pearson correlation data integration) utilizes multidimensional data encompassing emotional tendencies. On this basis, a constrained Data Fusion Module (DFM) is proposed to process the prediction results of Model I and Model II. For the Stock Index dataset 000881.SZ, covering the period 2017-2023. The BERT-DPCNN-MFM model is one of the most efficient MFMs produced, it obtained 0.0947, 0.0699, and 0.0090 results in RMSE, MAE, and MSE, respectively. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the model, while proving that the model can reflect the short-term fluctuation of stock prices.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","582–593","","","","","","","BDEIM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","CCAM-Attention-BiLSTM; Complete Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition with Adaptive Noise (CEEMDAN); emotional tendencies; Pearson correlation; Stock predictors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a significant portion of this data remains confidential or restricted due to its sensitive nature, such as patient data or census microdata. While maintaining confidentiality prohibits its public release, the emergence of portals supporting rich metadata can help enable researchers to at least discover the existence of restricted access data, empowering them to assess the suitability of the data before requesting access. Existing standards, such as CSV on the Web and RDF Data Cube, have been adopted to facilitate data management, integration, and re-use of data on the Web. However, the current landscape still lacks adequate standards not only to effectively describe restricted access data while preserving confidentiality but also to facilitate its discovery. In this work, we investigate the relationship between the structural, statistical, and semantic elements of restricted access tabular data, and we explore how such relationship can be formally modeled in a way that is Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. We introduce the DataSet-Variable Ontology (DSV), that by combining CSV on the Web and RDF Data Cube standards, leveraging semantic technologies and Linked Data principles, and introducing variable-level metadata, aims to capture high-quality metadata to support the management and re-use of restricted access data on the Web. As evaluation, we conducted a case study where we applied DSV to four different datasets from different statistical governmental agencies. We employed a set of competency questions to assess the ontology’s ability to support knowledge discovery and data exploration. By describing high-quality metadata, both at the dataset- and variable levels, while maintaining data privacy, this novel ontology facilitates data interoperability, discovery, and re-use and it empowers researchers to manage, integrate, and analyze complex restricted access data sources.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","83–91","","","","","","","K-CAP '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pensacola, FL, USA","","","","Semantic Web; FAIR principles; Privacy-preserving web data; Restricted access data; Variable-level metadata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Through the analysis of the data in the cultural field of the ancient capital of Beijing, a cultural feature dictionary is constructed, and a domain-specific feature matrix is constructed in the form of word vector splicing. The feature matrix is used to constrain the embedding graph model TransR, and then the feature matrix and the TransR model are jointly trained to complete the embedded expression of the knowledge graph. Finally, a comparative experiment is carried out on the Beijing ancient capital cultural knowledge graph dataset and the effects of the classic graph embedding algorithms TransE, TransH, and TransR.

Although VAR can be solved accurately using existing deep learning techniques, deep networks are neither interpretable nor explainable and as a result their use is problematic in high stakes decision-making applications (in healthcare, experimental Biology, aviation, law, etc.). In such applications, failure may lead to disastrous consequences and therefore it is necessary that the user is able to either understand the inner workings of the model or probe it to understand its reasoning patterns for a given decision. We address these limitations of deep networks by proposing a new approach that feeds the output of a deep model into a tractable, interpretable probabilistic model called a dynamic conditional cutset network that is defined over the explanatory and output variables and then performing joint inference over the combined model. The two key benefits of using cutset networks are: (a) they explicitly model the relationship between the output and explanatory variables and as a result, the combined model is likely to be more accurate than the vanilla deep model and (b) they can answer reasoning queries in polynomial time and as a result, they can derive meaningful explanations by efficiently answering explanation queries. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on two datasets, Textually Annotated Cooking Scenes (TACoS), and wet lab, using conventional evaluation measures such as the Jaccard Index and Hamming Loss, as well as a human-subjects study.","2023-12","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","4","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","cutset networks; dynamic Bayesian networks; Temporal models; tractable probabilistic models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed solution, called Cyberismo, facilitates the adoption of compliance and cybersecurity management, improves collaboration on cybersecurity in company internal projects, cross-company projects, and open-source projects, and automates the compliance and cybersecurity management in software development by way of an open information model representation format, and an open-source tool to manage the information model. As the information model uses a simple plain text format that can be managed by automated DevSecOps tool chains, it can be understood as an instance of the Everything as Code and Security as Code paradigms. The proposed solution is designed as modular, tailorable to the organisation and its existing tools, and flexible enough to model both process- and technology-related information. It automates both the validation of how compliance requirements have been met and the gathering and archiving of evidence of compliance. The information model is mapped to a logic program conforming to the Answer Set Programming (ASP) paradigm for knowledge representation. The mapping enables flexible query evaluation and reasoning, including the calculation of performance measures and automated policy checks. However, developers, product owners and other end-users of the solution do not necessarily need to know how to write logic programs, as logic programs can be encapsulated in content modules made available for the users. By putting the ease of adoption of compliant DevSecOps processes by the practitioners in the spotlight, this paper concludes that it is both necessary and possible to meet all the proposed requirements.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","93–102","","","","","","","eSAAM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Mainz, Germany","","","","knowledge representation and reasoning; DevOps; answer set programming; compliance; Cybersecurity management; DevSecOps; Everything as Code; open source security; process adoption; Security as Code","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recently, there has been a trend of nation states backing APT groups in order to further their political and financial interests, making the APT attribution process increasingly important. The APT attribution process involves identifying the actors behind an attack and their motivations, using a method of logical inference called abductive reasoning to determine the most likely explanation for a set of observations. While various attribution methods and frameworks have been proposed by the security community, many of them lack granularity and are dependent on the skills of practitioners rather than a standardized process. This can hinder both the understandability and reproducibility of attribution efforts as this process is practiced but not engineered. To address these issues, we propose a new framework for the APT attribution process based on the Zachman ontology, which offers greater granularity by posing specific primitive questions at various levels of the attribution process. This allows for more accurate conclusions about the attackers and their motivations, helping organizations to better protect themselves against future attacks.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","34–41","","","","","","","EICC '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Stavanger, Norway","","","","APT; Attribution Framework; Cyber Criminology; Cyber Investigation.; Zachman Ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since words that share semantics are expected to be clustered together, it is common to use a feature vector representation generated from a distributional theory-based word embedding method. The goal of this work is to utilize Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) for better clustering performance of the low-resource Iraqi vocabulary. We began with a new Dialect Fast Stemming Algorithm (DFSA) that utilizes the MSA data. The proposed algorithm achieved 0.85 accuracy measured by the F1 score. Then, the distributional theory-based word embedding method and a new simple, yet effective, feature vector named Wasf-Vec word embedding are tested. Wasf-Vec word representation utilizes a word’s topology features. The difference between Wasf-Vec and distributional theory-based word embedding is that Wasf-Vec captures relations that are not contextually based. The embedding is followed by an analysis of how the dialect words are clustered within other MSA words. The analysis is based on the word semantic relations that are well supported by solid linguistic theories to shed light on the strong and weak word relation representations identified by each embedding method. The analysis is handled by visualizing the feature vector in two-dimensional (2D) space. The feature vectors of the distributional theory-based word embedding method are plotted in 2D space using the t-sne algorithm, while the Wasf-Vec feature vectors are plotted directly in 2D space. A word’s nearest neighbors and the distance-histograms of the plotted words are examined. For validation purpose of the word classification used in this article, the produced classes are employed in Class-based Language Modeling (CBLM). Wasf-Vec CBLM achieved a 7% lower perplexity (pp) than the distributional theory-based word embedding method CBLM. This result is significant when working with low-resource languages.","2019-12","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","morphology; Word embedding; Arabic language; Topology; 2D visualizing; class-based language modeling; dialect; orthographic; phonology; words classification; words features; words ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this context, an enhanced framework is introduced that supports dynamic variability evolution using the SES approach. However, the main focus is to start a discussion about a set of design patterns, which were developed to analyze the tree design and computing aspects of System Entity Structures. As development of our MATLAB-based SES toolbox for construction and pruning of SES trees proceeded, the necessity to have some generalized examples for testing and verification came more and more into awareness. We propose a set of design patterns that, if completely representable and computable by a certain tool, support all aspects of SES theory. In addition, the patterns give users substantial support for developing SES models for other applications.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","","","","","","Mod4Sim '18","","","","Society for Computer Simulation International","San Diego, CA, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Baltimore, Maryland","","","","MATLAB/simulink; model generation; SES; simulation engineering; system entity structure; variability modeling; versatile systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, their behavior is getting more complex, particularly, in tasks related to mapping an environment and localizing themselves. These tasks comprise the Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) problem. Representation of knowledge related to the SLAM problem with a standard, flexible, and well-defined model, provides the base to develop efficient and interoperable solutions. As many existing works demonstrate, Semantic Web seems to be a clear approach, since they have formulated ontologies, as the base data model to represent such knowledge. In this article, we survey the most popular and recent SLAM ontologies with our aim being threefold: (i) propose a classification of SLAM ontologies according to the main knowledge needed to model the SLAM problem; (ii) identify existing ontologies for classifying, comparing, and contrasting them, in order to conceptualize SLAM domain for mobile robots; and (iii) pin-down lessons to learn from existing solutions in order to design better solutions and identify new research directions and further improvements. We compare the identified SLAM ontologies according to the proposed classification and, finally, we explore new data fields to enrich existing ontologies and highlight new possibilities in terms of performance and efficiency for SLAM solutions.","2020-09","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","5","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","semantic web; SLAM; robots; Web ontologies","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article presents a methodology for reducing efforts for structural variation during the experimental phase of a simulation study. Starting from a valid initial simulation model, structural variants of this simulation model are automatically generated by applying component-based software synthesis which uses combinatorial logic; thereby, a range of simulation models is provided for the user.

In this context, this work proposes an ontology for indoor and outdoor environments of a city to represent the cultural heritage knowledge based on the UNESCO definitions.

In this paper, we propose to monitor and analyze the modeling process in order to timely detect anomalous modeling behaviors, potentially contributing to a comprehensive assessment of the modeling practice. Specifically, we propose to systematically build a goal model for characterizing the normal modeling behaviors, which establishes the connections between modelers' high-level modeling behaviors and low-level modeling operations. On top of such a goal model, we propose a data mining-based approach to semi-automatically validate the design of the goal model and explore other normal modeling behaviors. Then, we propose to automatically detect anomalous modeling behaviors by capturing normal modeling behaviors obtained from the goal model and actual modeling sequences. We have developed and deployed a data-flow diagram modeling platform, which implemented our proposed approach. We have conducted an experiment with 57 participants, the preliminary results of which show that our approach can effectively detect modelers' anomalous behaviors.

Urdu is the 11th largest language in the world and has no computer-aided multi-label textual news classification approach. Unlike other languages, Urdu is lacking multi-label text classification datasets that can be used to benchmark the performance of existing machine and deep learning methodologies. With an aim to accelerate and expedite research for the development of Urdu multi-label text classification–based applications, this article provides multiple contributions as follows: First, it provides a manually annotated multi-label textual news classification dataset for the Urdu language. Second, it benchmarks the performance of traditional machine learning approaches particularly by adapting three data transformation approaches along with three top-performing machine learning classifiers and four algorithm adaptation-based approaches. Third, it benchmarks performance of 16 existing deep learning approaches and the four most widely used language models. Finally, it provides an ensemble approach that reaps the benefits of three different deep learning architectures to precisely predict different classes associated with a particular Urdu textual document. Experimental results reveal that proposed ensemble approach performance values (87% accuracy, 92% F1-score, and 8% hamming loss) are significantly higher than adapted machine and deep learning–based approaches.","2023-09","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","9","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","deep learning; language models; data transformation methods; multi-label ensemble learning; multi-label Urdu news dataset; Multi-label Urdu text classification; traditional machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such perspective, several studies have investigated the potential benefits about the use of videos as a support for the process of teaching in virtual learning environments and, particularly, in the context of MOOCs. However, video production for MOOCs still presents several challenges that need to be better investigated. It is because, in general, educators and MOOC teams (e.g. educators, learning designers, and educational technologists) are still using ad hoc decision-making procedures based on empirical knowledge obtained from their experiences with face-to-face courses or even traditional virtual courses. There are also gaps about what adaptations need to be performed to video formats and what are the attributes and steps needed to support the production and validation of videos for the MOOC context. In addition, since MOOCs are part of the Open Educational Movement, as well as the OERs, it is also important to reflect on the construction of OERs in the form of videos for the MOOC context. There is, therefore, a need for research that investigates the current theoretical panorama involving video construction for MOOCs, in order to propose strategies empirically validated and useful to support and guide MOOC teams during the development of videos more theoretically informed. Considering such context, the main objective of this paper is to present a set of patterns and move towards the development of an educational design pattern language able to support MOOC teams in the construction of OERs in the form of videos. The paper presents a life cycle for OERs production in the form of videos. From such cycle activities, we extracted nine patterns that are presented in the form of patlets (problem-solution pair). The patterns were also collected and refined from a literature review on guidelines about the production of MOOCs, OERs, and educational videos. The patterns are divided into five categories related to the life cycle: analysis, planning development, evaluation, and distribution. These patterns are expected to offer a compelling alternative to guide MOOC teams in designing OERs in the form of videos to enhance learning experiences, increase student engagement in the course, and emphasize self-directed learning, which are requirements for quality in MOOCs.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","","","","","","PLoP '19","","","","The Hillside Group","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Urbana, Illinois","","","","educational design patterns; educational videos; learning design; MOOCs; patterns","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This capability benefits various downstream information retrieval (IR) tasks. The primary challenge lies in enabling models to generalize effectively to unseen relation categories. Existing approaches typically leverage the knowledge embedded in pre-trained language models to accomplish the generalization process. However, these methods focus solely on fitting the training data during training, without specifically improving the model's generalization performance, resulting in limited generalization capability. For this reason, we explore the integration of bi-level optimization (BLO) with pre-trained language models for learning generalized knowledge directly from the training data, and propose a generative meta-learning framework which exploits the 'learning-to-learn' ability of meta-learning to boost the generalization capability of generative models.Specifically, we introduce a BLO approach that simultaneously addresses data fitting and generalization. This is achieved by constructing an upper-level loss to focus on generalization and a lower-level loss to ensure accurate data fitting. Building on this, we subsequently develop three generative meta-learning methods, each tailored to a distinct category of meta-learning. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework performs well on the ZeroRTE task.

Unlike the majority of coaching, and in general well-being related conversational agents that can be found in the literature, ours is not designed by hand-crafted rules. Instead, we directly model the coaching strategy of professionals with end users. To this end, we gather a set of virtual coaching sessions through a Wizard of Oz platform, and apply state of the art Natural Language Processing techniques. We employ a transfer learning approach, pretraining GPT2 neural language models and fine-tuning them on our corpus. However, since these only take as input a local dialogue history, a simple fine-tuning procedure is not capable of modeling the long-term dialogue strategies that appear in coaching sessions. To alleviate this issue, we first propose to learn dialogue phase and scenario embeddings in the fine-tuning stage. These indicate to the model at which part of the dialogue it is and which kind of coaching session it is carrying out. Second, we develop a global deep learning system which controls the long-term structure of the dialogue. We also show that this global module can be used to visualize and interpret the decisions taken by the the conversational agent, and that the learnt representations are comparable to dialogue acts. Automatic and human evaluation show that our proposals serve to improve the baseline models. Finally, interaction experiments with coaching experts indicate that the system is usable and gives rise to positive emotions in Spanish, French and English, while the results in Norwegian point out that there is still work to be done in fully data driven approaches with very low resource languages.","2022-07","2025-09-10 14:12:04","2025-09-10 14:12:04","","","","2","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Dialogue system; explainable artificial intelligence; coaching; multilingual; transfer learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we explore the challenges and significance of text similarity regression models in the context of online social networking services. We delve into the methods and techniques employed to define and find similarities among texts, enabling the extraction of meaningful patterns and insights. Specifically, we categorize text similarity regression models into four distinct types: set-theoretic, sequence-theoretic, real-vector, and end-to-end methods. This categorization is based on the mathematical formalisation of similarity used by each model. Ultimately, our survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the interlinkages between independently proposed methods for text similarity. By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these methods, researchers can make informed decisions when designing novel approaches and algorithms.

To support semantic sufficiency, we design a standard representation for capturing application metadata requirements and a templating system for generating common metadata model components with limited user input. We then construct an iterative model creation workflow that integrates metadata requirements to direct the model creation effort, and present several novel optimizations that increase the model utility while minimizing the effort by a human operator. These new abstractions for model creation and validation lower model development costs and ensure the utility of the resulting model, thus facilitating the adoption of intelligent building applications.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","228–237","","","","","","","BuildSys '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boston, Massachusetts","","","","ontology; semantics; metadata; applications; brick","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A potentially better idea is to reuse the “off-the-shelf” ontologies, whenever possible, somehow as per certain demands and requirements. A promising way to achieve ontology reuse is through creating views of ontologies, analogous to creating views of databases, with the resulting views focusing on specific topics and content of the original ontologies. This paper explores the problem of creating views of ontologies using a uniform interpolation approach. In particular, we develop a novel and practical uniform interpolation method for creating signature-based views for ontologies specified in the description logic , a very expressive description logic for which uniform interpolation has not been fully addressed. The method is terminating and sound, and computes uniform interpolants of -ontologies by eliminating from the input ontologies the names not used in the view using a forgetting procedure. This makes it the first and so far the only approach to eliminate both concept and (non-transitive) role names from -ontologies. Despite the inherent difficulty of uniform interpolation for this level of expressivity, an empirical evaluation with a prototypical implementation show very good success rates on a corpus of real-world ontologies, and demonstrates clear algorithmic advantage over the state-of-the-art system LETHE. This is extremely useful from the semantic web perspective, as it provides knowledge engineers with a powerful tool to create views of ontologies for ontology reuse.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","808–817","","","","","","","WWW '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Lyon, France","","","","Ontologies; Description Logics; Forgetting; Knowledge Representation and Reasoning; The Semantic Web; Uniform Interpolation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, it can be quite difficult to characterize the models of an ontology up to isomorphism.

However, researchers often train and evaluate new models on small or outdated datasets that do not reflect the current state of knowledge, thereby disregarding new information and the rich textual content often linked to knowledge graphs. As a result, many opportunities to leverage these dimensions are missed. We introduce WikiRAG, a framework for knowledge completion and evaluation derived from Wikidata and Wikipedia, which enables research integrating retrieval techniques and large language models. Our framework combines the following contributions: (i) We revisit the Wikidata5M dataset by updating it to reflect the current state of Wikidata and providing automated tools for its periodic maintenance. (ii) We enrich the dataset with long-form textual content sourced from Wikipedia, enabling research that goes beyond traditional graph structures and shallow text methods toward dense retrieval techniques. (iii) We propose a simple yet effective baseline that leverages retrieval-augmented generation, demonstrating the utility of the dataset and integrating language model capabilities for link prediction. The revised dataset, coined Wikidata5M-RE, shows that the original graph grew by roughly 50% in the number of edges, while 10% of the edges have been removed. A comparative analysis of classic methods demonstrates that these changes can impact downstream task evaluation. Finally, our evaluation of WikiRAG's KGC method shows an improvement of up to 9% in link prediction accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines, setting the stage for a new avenue in knowledge completion that uses deep information extraction.

In digital libraries, information access and sharing is often facilitated by terminology databases. However, building up such resources is expensive to produce manually and requires expert knowledge. Automatically generating definitions for scientific terms has become a hot research topic recently that can reduce the manual burden. However, current methods heavily rely on large language models (LLMs) that store factual knowledge in their parameters, so that knowledge cannot be easily updated for emerging scientific terms. Furthermore, a major shortcoming of these models is that they are prone to hallucination and their output is difficult to control. To bridge these gaps, we propose to address the task of definition generation through guided abstractive summarization, incorporating key information from external resources. At test time, we augment the model with retrieved abstracts from Scopus and use automatically extracted topics and keywords as guidance, both essential for definition generation. To this aim, our approach takes into account two relevant sub-tasks in the process, a) predicting the topic class and b) generating hypernym candidates for the term. Our proposed pipelined approach for automatic guided definition generation achieves significant performance improvement over the standard baselines as well as relevant prior works on this problem. We use BLEU, ROUGE and BERTScore to automatically evaluate the quality of the systems on our benchmark and carry out a human evaluation to assess fluency, relevancy, coherence and factuality of the output. Our experiments show that LLMs can provide fluent and coherent definitions, and are often on par with human created definitions. Yet, there is still room for improvement on identifying relevant content and improving factual correctness.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model focuses on practical aspects of steganalysis of communication data to elaborate linking properties to previous code analysis knowledge. The model features two distinct roles that interact with a knowledge base which stores malware features and helps building a context for the incident. For evaluation, two image steganography malware types are chosen from popular databases (malpedia and MITRE ATT&amp;CK®), which are analyzed in multiple steps including steganalysis and code analysis. It is conceptually shown, how the extracted features can be stored in a knowledge base for later use to identify stegomalware from communication data without the need of a thorough code analysis.

In this study, we develop a combined deep learning method named PhenoBERT for this purpose. PhenoBERT uses BERT, currently the state-of-the-art NLP model, as its core model for evaluating whether a clinically relevant text segment (CTS) could be represented by an HPO term. However, to avoid unnecessary comparison of a CTS with each of ∼14,000 HPO terms using BERT, we introduce a two-levels CNN module consisting of a series of CNN models organized at two levels in PhenoBERT. For a given CTS, the CNN module produces only a short list of candidate HPO terms for BERT to evaluate, significantly improving the computational efficiency. In addition, BERT is able to assign an ancestor HPO term to a CTS when recognition of the direct HPO term is not successful, mimicking the process of HPO term assignment by human. In two benchmarks, PhenoBERT outperforms four traditional dictionary-based methods and two recently developed deep learning-based methods in two benchmark tests, and its advantage is more obvious when the recognition task is more challenging. As such, PhenoBERT is of great use for assisting in the mining of clinical text data.","2022-04","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","1269–1277","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Washington, DC, USA Publisher: IEEE Computer Society Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing research primarily employs advanced graph neural networks and sequential algorithms for patient modeling, with a focus on discerning the connections and sequential patterns inherent in Electronic Health Records (EHRs). However, the heterogeneity of entity interactions, the locality of EHR data, and the oversight of target relevance hinder further improvements. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel framework Beyond Sequential Patterns (BSP), which facilitates precise healthcare predictions by incorporating tri-contextual information. Specifically, we establish a symptom-driven hypergraph network with four semantic hyperedges tailored to the intricacies of the healthcare scenario, such as ontology. This serves as a global context, tracking the heterogeneous entity collaboration within and across patients. Moreover, we construct an extensive knowledge graph leveraging existing medical databases and large language models. By sampling and refining knowledge subgraphs as local context, we bolster the semantic associations of medical entities from closed-set EHR data to the open world. Finally, we introduce the candidate context, an explicit entity-relation loss. It enforces the neighbor consistency between the target and the representation during optimization, thus accounting for correlations among targets. Extensive experiments and rigorous robustness analysis on five tasks derived from four large medical datasets underscore the BSP’s superiority over the leading baselines, with improvements of 11%, 3%, 11%, 3.5%, and 2% across five tasks, demonstrating the efficacy of incorporating diverse contexts.","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Large language model; Healthcare prediction; Hypergraph learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, we utilize systematic methods to improve XLORE's data quality and present its latest version, XLORE 3, which enables the effective integration and management of heterogeneous knowledge from diverse resources. Compared with previous versions, XLORE 3 has three major advantages: (1) We design a comprehensive and reasonable schema, namely XLORE ontology, which can effectively organize and manage entities from various resources. (2) We merge equivalent entities in different languages to facilitate knowledge sharing. We provide a large-scale entity linking system to establish the associations between unstructured text and structured KG. (3) We design a multi-strategy knowledge completion framework, which leverages pre-trained language models and vast amounts of unstructured text to discover missing and new facts. The resulting KG contains 446 concepts, 2,608 properties, 66 million entities, and more than 2 billion facts.

Similar to Knowledge Graphs (KGs), ontologies are often incomplete, and maintaining and constructing them has proved challenging. While classical deductive reasoning algorithms use the precise formal semantics of an ontology to predict missing facts, recent years have witnessed growing interest in inductive reasoning techniques that can derive probable facts from an ontology. Similar to KGs, a promising approach is to learn ontology embeddings in a latent vector space, while additionally ensuring they adhere to the semantics of the underlying DL. While a variety of approaches have been proposed, current ontology embedding methods suffer from several shortcomings, especially that they all fail to faithfully model one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relations and role inclusion axioms. To address this problem and improve ontology completion performance, we propose a novel ontology embedding method named Box2EL for the DL EL++, which represents both concepts and roles as boxes (i.e., axis-aligned hyperrectangles), and models inter-concept relationships using a bumping mechanism. We theoretically prove the soundness of Box2EL and conduct an extensive experimental evaluation, achieving state-of-the-art results across a variety of datasets on the tasks of subsumption prediction, role assertion prediction, and approximating deductive reasoning.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","2250–2258","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","web ontology language; link prediction; description logic; ontology completion; ontology embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Machine learning models have been developed to facilitate the semantic indexing of scientific papers. However their performance on the more comprehensive ontologies of biomedical concepts does not reach the levels of typical entity recognition problems studied in NLP. In large part this is due to their low resources, where the ontologies are large, there is a lack of descriptive text defining most entities, and labeled data can only cover a small portion of the ontology.

There are various research tasks, such as spam e-mail classification, abusive language detection, sentiment analysis, and emotion mining, where a set of domain-specific keywords (aka lexicon) is highly effective. Existing works for keyword extraction list all keywords rather than domain-specific keywords from a document corpus. Moreover, most of the existing approaches perform well on formal document corpuses but fail on noisy and informal user-generated content in online social media. In this article, we present a hybrid approach by jointly modeling the local and global contextual semantics of words, utilizing the strength of distributional word representation and contrasting-domain corpus for domain-specific keyword extraction. Starting with a seed set of a few domain-specific keywords, we model the text corpus as a weighted word-graph. In this graph, the initial weight of a node (word) represents its semantic association with the target domain calculated as a linear combination of three semantic association metrics, and the weight of an edge connecting a pair of nodes represents the co-occurrence count of the respective words. Thereafter, a modified PageRank method is applied to the word-graph to identify the most relevant words for expanding the initial set of domain-specific keywords. We evaluate our method over both formal and informal text corpuses (comprising six datasets), and show that it performs significantly better in comparison to state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we generalize our approach to handle the language-agnostic case, and show that it outperforms existing language-agnostic approaches.","2022-01","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","","","4","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Text mining; information extraction; domain-specific keyword extraction; language-agnostic keyword extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These items and item-related entities are often mentioned along the development of a dialog, leading to potential sequential dependencies among them. However, most of existing CRSs neglect these potential sequential dependencies. In this article, we first propose a Transformer-based sequential conversational recommendation method, named TSCR, to model the sequential dependencies in the conversations to improve CRS. In TSCR, we represent conversations by items and the item-related entities, and construct user sequences to discover user preferences by considering both the mentioned items and item-related entities. Based on the constructed sequences, we deploy a Cloze task to predict the recommended items along a sequence. Meanwhile, in certain domains, knowledge graphs formed by the items and their related entities are readily available, which provide various different kinds of associations among them. Given that TSCR does not benefit from such knowledge graphs, we then propose a knowledge graph enhanced version of TSCR, called TSCRKG. In specific, we leverage the knowledge graph to offline initialize our model TSCRKG, and augment the user sequence of conversations (i.e., sequence of the mentioned items and item-related entities in the conversation) with multi-hop paths in the knowledge graph. Experimental results demonstrate that our TSCR model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, and the enhanced version TSCRKG further improves recommendation performance on top of TSCR.","2024-10","2025-09-10 14:12:05","2025-09-10 14:12:05","","","","6","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","transformer; recommender system; Conversational recommendation; sequential recommendation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a software architecture for studying the ecosystem of 'smart buildings'. This software architecture is built: 1) on top of ontologies for the description of smart buildings; 2) on a special tool for mastering the life cycle of data produced by sensors and actuators inside the buildings.We assume that it is equally important to model both the building's components and the flow of data produced inside the building.

This comprehensive survey systematically investigates fundamental concepts and models, developing a systematic taxonomy and critically evaluating diverse models. We begin by defining core concepts, formalizing the ECI problem, and outlining standard evaluation protocols. Our classification framework divides ECI models into two primary tasks: Sentence-level Event Causality Identification (SECI) and Document-level Event Causality Identification (DECI). For SECI, we review models employing feature pattern-based matching, machine learning classifiers, deep semantic encoding, prompt-based fine-tuning, and causal knowledge pre-training, alongside data augmentation strategies. For DECI, we focus on approaches utilizing deep semantic encoding, event graph reasoning, and prompt-based fine-tuning. Special attention is given to recent advancements in multi-lingual and cross-lingual ECI, as well as zero-shot ECI leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We analyze the strengths, limitations, and unresolved challenges associated with each approach. Extensive quantitative evaluations are conducted on four benchmark datasets to rigorously assess the performance of various ECI models.

Accordingly, in previous work, we proposed REACT, a reusable, model-based runtime environment to complement communication systems with adaptive behavior. REACT addresses heterogeneity and distribution aspects of such systems and reduces development effort. In this article, we propose REACT-ION—an extension of REACT for situation awareness. REACT-ION offers a context management module that is able to acquire, store, disseminate, and reason on context data. The context management module is the basis for (i) proactive adaptation with REACT-ION and (ii) self-improvement of the underlying feedback loop.

The primary purpose of this dataset is to serve as a tool for evaluating domain-specific language representation models and embedding vector pooling techniques by assessing the semantic relatedness of co-hyponymic multiword terms. The novelty of the dataset lies in the development approach, which replaces intuition-based scaling of relatedness with linguistically justified semantic-feature-based judgment. Furthermore, the traditional method of calculating interrater agreement rate is replaced with a statistical analysis of vector space distance between low and highly related terms.

While heuristic methods are often inflexible and hard to extend to new domains, ML methods rely on substantial and hard to obtain amounts of labeled training data. To overcome these limitations, we propose VersaMatch, a flexible, weakly-supervised ontology matching system. VersaMatch employs various weak supervision sources, such as heuristic rules, pattern matching, and external knowledge bases, to produce labels from a large amount of unlabeled data for training a discriminative ML model. For prediction, VersaMatch develops a novel ensemble model combining the weak supervision sources with the discriminative model to support generalization while retaining a high precision. Our ensemble method boosts end model performance by 4 points compared to a traditional weak-supervision baseline. In addition, compared to state-of-the-art ontology matchers, VersaMatch achieves an overall 4-point performance improvement in F1 score across 26 ontology combinations from different domains. For recently released, in-the-wild datasets, VersaMatch beats the next best matchers by 9 points in F1. Furthermore, its core weak-supervision logic can easily be improved by adding more knowledge sources and collecting more unlabeled data for training.","2023-02","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","1305–1318","","6","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It presents a system that allows users to interact with a DGM by drawing on paper (rather than the typical text prompts used by most current systems). 2. We demonstrate how this mode and quality of interaction establish a unique perspective on Munch’s drawings as a practice. Through qualitative evaluation, we discuss how this setup led users towards a specific hermeneutic drawing strategy that enables building competency with the model and by proxy the data it is trained on.

The so-called responsible Artificial Intelligence (AI) practitioners or AI ethicists are generally tasked with interpreting and operationalizing best practices for ethical and safe design of AI systems. Due to the nascent nature of these roles, however, it is unclear to future employers and aspiring AI ethicists what specific function these roles serve and what skills are necessary to serve the functions. Without clarity on these, we cannot train future AI ethicists with meaningful learning objectives. In this work, we examine what responsible AI practitioners do in the industry and what skills they employ on the job. We propose an ontology of existing roles alongside skills and competencies that serve each role. We created this ontology by examining the job postings for such roles over a two-year period (2020-2022) and conducting expert interviews with fourteen individuals who currently hold such a role in the industry. Our ontology contributes to business leaders looking to build responsible AI teams and provides educators with a set of competencies that an AI ethics curriculum can prioritize.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","584–595","","","","","","","AIES '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montréal, QC, Canada","","","","Education; Competency Framework; Responsible AI Practitioner","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One of these challenges is keeping a stable energy grid when transitioning the production to unpredictable energy generation from green sources. Demand Response (DR) can mitigate some of the lack of predictability by influencing the consumer’s load profile. Unfortunately, the cost of implementing DR, and the required infrastructure, vastly overshadows the benefits for the consumer, thereby negating the incentive to invest. Therefore, reducing the initial cost of investment is a critical factor for the success of DR. Building Operating Systems (BOS) is one possible avenue to achieve DR functionality in buildings. This paper seeks to reduce initial investment costs of BOSes, by introducing an ontology-based package manager (OPM), that dynamically resolves dependencies and installs services. An ontology-based approach to dependency resolution allows for loosely defined dependencies but also takes the context of the service into account, as well as requirements in terms of sensor availability and physical layout of the building. The OPM is evaluated by deploying a BOS and accompanying services for occupancy prediction. By significantly reducing deployment complexity, results show considerable time savings, and thereby cost reductions, on deployment and maintenance activities.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","118–125","","","","","","","IoT '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: St.Gallen, Switzerland","","","","ontology; OWL; building operating systems; containerization; dependency resolution; deployment; Package manager","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To jointly model social influence and tag relation, we formulate micro-video tagging as a link prediction problem in a constructed heterogeneous network.

The key of implementing ZSL is to leverage the prior knowledge of classes which builds the semantic relationship between classes and enables the transfer of the learned models (e.g., features) from training classes (i.e., seen classes) to unseen classes. However, the priors adopted by the existing methods are relatively limited with incomplete semantics. In this paper, we explore richer and more competitive prior knowledge to model the inter-class relationship for ZSL via ontology-based knowledge representation and semantic embedding. Meanwhile, to address the data imbalance between seen classes and unseen classes, we developed a generative ZSL framework with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). Our main findings include: (i) an ontology-enhanced ZSL framework that can be applied to different domains, such as image classification (IMGC) and knowledge graph completion (KGC); (ii) a comprehensive evaluation with multiple zero-shot datasets from different domains, where our method often achieves better performance than the state-of-the-art models. In particular, on four representative ZSL baselines of IMGC, the ontology-based class semantics outperform the previous priors e.g., the word embeddings of classes by an average of 12.4 accuracy points in the standard ZSL across two example datasets (see Figure&nbsp;4).","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","3325–3336","","","","","","","WWW '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia","","","","Ontology; Generative Adversarial Networks; Knowledge Graph Completion; Image Classification; Zero-shot Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such semanticity constitutes a sound basis for defining, sharing (business) objectives and interests and eventually developing useful collaborative services and systems.

A Personalized Learning Environment (PLE) that automatically adapts to learner characteristics such as learning styles and knowledge level can recommend appropriate learning resources that would favor the learning process and improve learning outcomes. The pure cold-start problem is a relevant issue in PLEs, which arises due to the lack of prior information about the new learner in the PLE to create appropriate recommendations. This article introduces a semantic framework based on ontology to address the pure cold-start problem in content recommenders. The ontology encapsulates the domain knowledge about the learners as well as Learning Objects (LOs). The semantic model that we built has been experimented with different combinations of the key learner parameters such as learning style, knowledge level, and background knowledge. The proposed framework utilizes these parameters to build natural learner groups from the learner ontology using SPARQL queries. The ontology holds 480 learners’ data, 468 annotated learning objects with 5,600 learner ratings. A multivariate k-means clustering algorithm, an unsupervised machine learning technique for grouping similar data, is used to evaluate the learner similarity computation accuracy. The learner satisfaction achieved with the proposed model is measured based on the ratings given by the 40 participants of the experiments. From the evaluation perspective, it is evident that 79% of the learners are satisfied with the recommendations generated by the proposed model in pure cold-start condition.","2021-04","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; learning object; personalized learning environment; content recommenders; Learner profile; multivariate clustering; pure cold-start problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Autonomous systems offer the potential to revolutionize this field by enabling robots to autonomously read scientific literature and form general synthesis workflows. However, a key challenge lies in integrating diverse hardware components, requiring adaptable architectures that can seamlessly operate across various platforms. Furthermore, these systems must be robust, allowing for real-time error correction, and accessible to non-programmers. This paper presents Autonomous Chemical Synthesis System (ACSS), an adaptable architecture for chemical execution systems designed to address these challenges. ACSS enables robots to autonomously read scientific literature and form general synthesis workflows. We achieve hardware independence through protocol-integration reinforcement learning, enabling seamless integration across platforms. Chemical code and hardware descriptions are compiled and converted into robotic instructions for execution. Natural language error correction allows non-programmers to easily adjust the system. Our key contributions are: (1) Literature to Lab: directly extracting synthesis protocols from scientific articles; (2) Hardware Independence: developing an adaptive, reinforcement learning-based model for diverse hardware setups. ACSS has successfully synthesized 12 diverse compounds from literature, including lidocaine (a painkiller), Dess-Martin periodinane (an oxidizing agent), and alkyl fluoride (a fluorinating agent).

As little is known about where computational linguistics integration is gaining momentum beyond academic research and software engineering, the purpose of this systematic mapping study is to map in what areas of distributed knowledge management it is perceived to gain traction. Drawing on data from 150 systematically selected research articles and trend analysis in computational linguistics applications, we identify a long tail of application domains and methodological approaches in which a total of 42 unique computational models operate, including techniques such as knowledge graph embeddings, transformer-based architectures, and multimodal language models. Our findings reveal a strong, positive correlation coefficient (r = 0.82) between natural language processing adoption and knowledge retrieval efficiency in distributed systems. However, existing frameworks do not passively comply. Rather, their linguistic adaptability and semantic interpretation mechanisms are integrated into the core functionality of distributed knowledge networks. The study concludes by identifying key research gaps, reflecting on the application of machine learning-enhanced linguistic models in the field of knowledge management, and proposing suggestions for future research directions in distributed data processing.

This results in time and space restrictions for medical services, and patients cannot obtain health information all the time and everywhere. Based on the medical knowledge graph, healthcare bots alleviate this burden effectively by providing patients with diagnosis guidance, pre-diagnosis, and post-diagnosis consultation services in the way of human-machine dialogue. However, the medical utterance is more complicated in language structure, and there are complex intention phenomena in semantics. It is a challenge to detect the single intent, multi-intent, and implicit intent of a patient’s utterance. To this end, we create a high-quality annotated Chinese Medical query (utterance) dataset, CMedQ (about 16.8k queries in medical domain which includes single, multiple, and implicit intents). It is hard to detect intent on such a complex dataset through traditional text classification models. Thus, we propose a novel detect model Conco-ERNIE, using concept co-occurrence patterns to enhance the representation of pre-trained model ERNIE. These patterns are mined using Apriori algorithm and will be embedded via Node2Vec. Their features will be aggregated with semantic features into Conco-ERNIE by using an attention module, which can catch user explicit intents and also predict user implicit intents. Experiments on CMedQ demonstrates that Conco-ERNIE achieves outstanding performance over baseline. Based on Conco-ERNIE, we develop an intelligent healthcare bot, MedicalBot. To provide knowledge support for MedicalBot, we also build a Chinese medical graph, CMedKG (about 45k entities and 283k relationships).","2023-02","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Intent detection; cognitive service; healthcare bot; medical knowledge graph","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In real-world applications, many biomedical ontologies describe knowledge in the same field. In order to make full use of existing knowledge, it is necessary to carry out knowledge fusion to obtain a unified knowledge structure. For this reason, it becomes particularly important to find mapping entities that refer to the same object in different ontologies. At present, a large number of automatic matching systems engineers features and match entities by the name of the entity, the ontology structure and external resources. These methods have achieved encouraging results, but they ignore the semantic information of the entity labels. On the other hand, the representation learning method has already shined in many areas of natural language processing. The word vector obtained by the word embedding method contains semantic information of words. However, a separate representation learning method cannot fully capture the structural information of the ontology. In this paper, we propose a method which combines the representation learning method as a component with traditional feature engineering methods to improve the performance of the matching systems.

The documentation typically runs into hundreds of Natural Language (NL) text documents which requirements engineers need to sift looking for the relevant information and also maintain these documents in-sync over time - a time-consuming and error-prone activity. Much of this difficulty can be overcome if the information is available in a structured form that is amenable to automated processing. Purposive models offer a way out. However, for easy adoption by industry practitioners, these models must be populated from NL text documents in a largely automated manner. This task is characterized by high variability with several documents containing different information conforming to different structures and styles. As a result, purposive information extractors need to be developed for each project/ product. Moreover, being an open-ended space there is no upper bound on the information extractors that need to be developed. To overcome this difficulty, we propose a document structure agnostic and meta-model agnostic tool, DocToModel, for the automated authoring of models from NL text documents. It provides a pattern mapping language to specify a mapping of structured and unstructured document information to meta-model elements, and a pattern interpreter to automate model authoring. The configurable and extensible architecture of DocToModel makes it generic and amenable to easy repurposing for other NL documents.

To be able to empirically verify this claim one needs to be able to expose the (often underlying) ontological structure and show that it does, indeed, make a commitment to multi-level types. We have not been able to find any published data showing this being done. From a top-level ontology requirements perspective, checking this multi-level type claim is worthwhile. If the datasets for which the top-level ontology is required are ontologically committed to multi-level types, then this is a requirement for the top-level ontology. In this paper, we both present some empirical evidence that this ubiquitous claim is correct as well as describing the process we used to expose the underlying ontological commitments and examine them. We describe how we use the bCLEARer process to analyse the UNICLASS classifications making their implicit ontological commitments explicit. We show how this reveals the requirements for two general ontological commitments; higher-order types and first-class relations. This establishes a requirement for a top-level ontology that includes the UNICLASS classification to be able to accommodate these requirements. From a multi-level type perspective, we have established that the bCLEARer entification process can identify underlying ontological commitments to multi-level type that do not exist in the surface linguistic structure. So, we have a process that we can reuse on other datasets and application systems to help empirically verify the claim that ontological multi-level types are ubiquitous.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:06","2025-09-10 14:12:06","","","","","","","","","MODELS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Canada","","","","top-level ontology; bCLEARer approach; first class relations; higher order types; UNICLASS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Techniques for computing natural-language descriptions of test cases can help increase test readability. However, so far, such techniques have been developed for unit test cases; they are not applicable to end-to-end test cases.In this paper, we focus on the problem of computing natural-language labels for the steps of end-to-end UI test cases for web applications. We present two techniques that apply natural-language processing to information available in the browser document object model (DOM). The first technique is an instance of a supervised approach in which labeling-relevant DOM attributes are ranked via manual analysis and fed into label computation. However, supervised approach requires a training dataset. So we propose the second technique, which is unsupervised: it leverages probabilistic context-free grammar learning to compute dominant DOM attributes automatically. We implemented these techniques, along with two simpler baseline techniques, in a tool called CrawLabel (available as a plugin to Crawljax, a state-of-the-art UI test-generation tool for web applications) and evaluated their effectiveness on open-source web applications. Our results indicate that the supervised approach can achieve precision, recall, and Fl-score of 83.38, 60.64, and 66.40, respectively. The unsupervised approach, although less effective, is competitive, achieving scores of 72.37, 58.12, and 59.77.

In this context, interoperability enables a service to communicate with another service transparently. Among the solutions proposed in the literature, a middleware can be used to intermediate such communication and to mitigate the lack of interoperability in cloud computing. For instance, the middleware MIDAS (Middleware for DaaS and SaaS) provides transparent interoperability between SaaS and DaaS. Although MIDAS current version promotes syntactic interoperability, semantic interoperability is only superficially addressed. In collaboration with this project, we develop an OWL-based ontology to formally represent the communication between SaaS and DaaS, and discuss its strengths in providing semantic interoperability on MIDAS.

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked new research into their potential for performing such information extraction tasks effectively. Our study examines a novel approach to employing LLMs in the 5W1H extraction process, particularly focusing on their capacity to mimic human reasoning. We introduce two innovative Chain-of-Thought (COT) prompting techniques to extract 5W1H in news: extractive reasoning and question-level reasoning.

We propose a multi-scale system modelling and explanation technique to address these concerns. The idea is to increase the scale, or abstraction level, of the modelled CPS, whenever possible without loss of salient information, so as to produce smaller system representations and hence to reduce the complexity of the explanatory process and of the generated explanations. We illustrate our proposal via an urban traffic case study, modelling traffic at two different scales (i.e., modelling individual cars at a lower-scale; and traffic jams at a higher-scale). We show how a multi-scale explanatory process can use the lower- and higher-scale models to generate either longer (more detailed) explanations, or shorter (more abstract) explanations, respectively.

However, an NLI that is trained in the general domain is hard to apply in the spatial domain due to the idiosyncrasy and expressiveness of the spatial questions. Inspired by the machine comprehension model, we propose a spatial comprehension model that is able to recognize the meaning of spatial entities based on the semantics of the context. The spatial semantics learned from the spatial comprehension model is then injected to the natural language question to ease the burden of capturing the spatial-specific semantics. With our spatial comprehension model and information injection, our NLI for the spatial domain, named SpatialNLI, is able to capture the semantic structure of the question and translate it to the corresponding syntax of an executable query accurately.

In traditional relational databases, a view is a subset of a database, whereas in ontologies, a view is more than a subset; it contains not only axioms contained in the original ontology, but may also contain newly-derived axioms entailed by the original ontology (implicitly contained in the original ontology). Specifically, given an ontology , the signature of is the set of all the names in , and a view of is a new ontology obtained from using only part of ’s signature, namely the target signature, while preserving all logical entailments up to the target signature. Computing views of OWL ontologies is useful for Semantic Web applications such as ontology-based query answering, in a way that the view can be used as a substitute of the original ontology to answer queries formulated with the target signature, and information hiding, in the sense that it restricts users from viewing certain information of an ontology. Forgetting is a form of non-standard reasoning concerned with eliminating from an ontology a subset of its signature, namely the forgetting signature, in such a way that all logical entailments are preserved up to the target signature. Forgetting can thus be used as a means for computing views of OWL ontologies — the solution of forgetting a set of names from an ontology is the view of for the target signature . In this paper, we present a forgetting-based method for computing views of OWL ontologies specified in the description logic , the basic extended with role hierarchy, nominals and inverse roles. The method is terminating and sound. Despite the method not being complete, an evaluation with a prototype implementation of the method on a corpus of real-world ontologies has shown very good success rates. This is very useful from the perspective of the Semantic Web, as it provides knowledge engineers with a powerful tool for creating views of OWL ontologies.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","2624–2635","","","","","","","WWW '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia","","","","Ontology; Description Logics; Forgetting; Semantics Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These days, visitors can access reliable CH content using Web and mobile-based interfaces. However, conventional CH systems still lack the ability to provide meaningful semantically overt results that precisely meet user information needs in this domain. In addition, they often ignore the user search context and experience, which hinders their ability to adapt their behavior to the preferences, tasks, interests, and other user functionalities. In this article, we aim to address the issue of designing a precision-oriented multilingual and multi-criteria semantic-based mobile recommender system specifically targeting Palestine's CH, a country with great historical and cultural importance. We aim to better facilitate users’ access to CH content by providing them with multiple search functionalities. In this context, a user can search for relevant information using keywords (a.k.a. tags) or sentence-like queries and the system retrieves all relevant documents based on their semantic similarity. A second option is to search using current location information to retrieve correlated historical places and events. Finally, starting from a picture of interest, a third option makes it possible to extract captions describing its content that can be used to search for additional contextually relevant information. Additionally, the proposed system aims at personalizing users’ experience through progressively delivering output that meets their information needs based on a number of parameters such as users' logging data, interests, previous searches, and location-based information. A prototype of the proposed system has been developed and tested using Android smartphones and a manually constructed ontology enriched with CH links to the Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus (AAT) and DBpedia. By comparing our system with similar systems in this domain, findings demonstrate that it provides additional search features and functionalities to users. The proposed Holy-Land ontology is the first of its kind attempting to encode knowledge about Palestine's CH. It plays a crucial role in our proposal, serving as a pivotal entity in the combination of language-based, location-based, and visual-based retrieval strategies.","2021-07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","","","3","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Cultural heritage; semantic similarity; content-based image retrieval; hybrid recommendation; knowledge-based search; manually constructed ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This knowledge heterogeneity could lead agents to disagree, thus hindering their cooperation. Existing approaches usually deal with this interaction problem by relating ontologies, without modifying them, or, on the contrary, by focusing on building common knowledge. Here, we consider agents adapting ontologies learned from the environment in order to agree with each other when cooperating. In this scenario, fundamental questions arise: Do they achieve successful interaction? Can this process improve knowledge correctness? Do all agents end up with the same ontology? To answer these questions, we design a two-stage experiment. First, agents learn to take decisions about the environment by classifying objects and the learned classifiers are turned into ontologies. In the second stage, agents interact with each other to agree on the decisions to take and modify their ontologies accordingly. We show that agents indeed reduce interaction failure, most of the time they improve the accuracy of their knowledge about the environment, and they do not necessarily opt for the same ontology.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","242–250","","","","","","","AAMAS '21","","","","International Foundation for Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems","Richland, SC","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, United Kingdom","","","","ontologies; knowledge diversity; multi-agent learning; multi-agent social simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These capabilities are at the core of many common reasoning tasks, including graph traversals, clustering, data matching and data fusion, and many more related real-world scenarios.However, the interplay of TGDs and EGDs is known to lead to undecidability or intractability of query answering in tractable Datalog+/- fragments, like Warded Datalog+/-, for which, in the sole presence of TGDs, query answering is PTIME in data complexity. Restrictions of equality constraints, like separable EGDs, have been studied, but all achieve decidability at the cost of limited expressive power, which makes them unsuitable for the mentioned tasks.This paper introduces the class of ""harmless"" EGDs, that subsume separable EGDs and allow to model a very broad class of tasks. We contribute a sufficient syntactic condition for testing harmlessness, an undecidable task in general. We argue that in Warded Datalog+/- with harmless EGDs, ontological reasoning is decidable and PTIME. From such theoretical underpinnings, we develop novel chase-based techniques for reasoning with harmless EGDs and present an implementation within the Vadalog system, a state-of-the-art Datalog-based reasoner.

Our results show, that the usage of graph query languages in open-source projects increased over the last years, with SPARQL and Cypher being by far the most popular. SPARQL projects are more active in terms of query related artifact changes and unique developers involved, but Cypher is catching up.

The article provides an overview of the existing methods of natural language processing and their practical application to the tasks of public administration. An integrated approach to the natural language processing tools using for solving practical problems in the field of public administration is considered on the example of the ISIDA-T system for extracting information from natural language texts, developed at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center PSI RAS. The system under consideration is distinguished by a modular approach to the pre-processing of unstructured text and the possibility of manual adjustment for a specific extraction task. This technological solution gives the necessary flexibility and ease of use.

As part of the supporting research, we first discuss the importance of taxonomies and classification systems in computing education, provide a formal method for building a taxonomy, and provide working definitions of TLEs based on previous literature. This is followed by a systematic literature review using a widely-accepted methodology for finding articles that have examined TLEs in primary, secondary, and post-secondary computing education. This literature review focuses on studies that looked at multiple TLEs and specifically attempted to classify or categorize them. We then propose a new taxonomy for classifying TLEs and provide definitions and samples for each category.

The approach relies on NLU processing of narratives, create a model that captures concepts and relationships, and finally provide a specification of a simulation implementation. An initial definition set and grammatical rules are proposed to formalize this process.

A common assumption in these works is that the query and the result documents are comprised of purely textual information without explicit structure. In map search, the relevance of results is determined based on rich heterogeneous features - textual features derived from the query and the results, geospatial features such as proximity of a result to the user, structured features reflecting the address format of the result, and the perceived structure of the query. In this work, we propose a novel deep neural network LTR architecture, capable of seamlessly handling heterogeneous inputs, similar to GBDT-based methods. At the same time, unlike GBDT, the architecture does not require human input via (numerous) carefully-crafted features. Instead, features are inferred through a self-attention mechanism. Our model implements two lightweight attention layers optimized for ranking: the first layer computes query-result similarities, the second implements listwise ranking inference. We perform evaluation on several single language and one multilingual dataset. Our model outperforms by a wide margin other Transformer-based ranking architectures and has equal or better performance than GBDT models. Equally important, runtime inference is orders of magnitude faster than other Transformer architectures, significantly reducing hardware serving costs. The model is a low-cost alternative suitable to power ranking in industrial map search engines across a variety of languages and markets.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","942–951","","","","","","","SIGIR '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Canada","","","","information retrieval; geocoding; language understanding; map search; ranking system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this approach, all the information required for managing the production (including a description of a product, processes involved in the production, and existing resources and their specifications) is captured in an ontology. The proposed Product, Process, and Resource (PPR) ontology defines fundamental conceptualization of the production that can be easily applied to the arbitrary domain. Application of the PPR ontology is demonstrated in the case of simple truck assembling by means of robots. Capturing the knowledge in the form of ontology provides the advantage of employing supporting tools such as reasoners for consistency checking or query languages for information extraction. The paper demonstrates the utilization of SQWRL for searching resources suitable to manipulate given truck parts on the basis of semantic matching between properties of particular elements.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","649–653","","","","","","","iiWAS2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Munich, Germany","","","","Ontology; Data Model Design; Industrial Automation; Semantic Matchmaking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We believe that this issue can be faced by providing archive catalogs with a semantic layer, containing rich semantic metadata, representing the content of documents in a full-fledged formal machine-readable format. In this article, we present the contribution offered in this direction by the PRiSMHA project, in which the conceptual vocabulary of the semantic layer is represented by computational ontologies. However, acquiring semantic knowledge represents a well-known bottleneck for knowledge-based systems; to solve this problem, PRiSMHA relies on a crowdsourcing collaborative model, i.e., an online community of users who collaborate in building semantic representations of the content of archival documents. In this perspective, this article aims at answering the following research question: Starting from the axioms characterizing concepts in the computational ontology underlying the system, how can we derive a user interface enabling users to formally represent the content of archival documents by exploiting the conceptual vocabulary provided by the ontology?Our solution includes the following steps: (a) a manually defined configuration, acting as a pre-filter, to hide “unsuited” classes, properties, and relations; (b) an algorithm, combining heuristics and reasoning, which extracts from the ontology all and only the “compatible” properties and relations, given an entity (event) type; and (c) a set of strategies to rank, group, and present the entity (event) properties and relations, based on the results of a study with users. This integrated solution enabled us to design an ontology-driven user interface enabling users to characterize entities, and in particular (historical) events, on the basis of the vocabulary provided by the ontology.","2020-08","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","computational ontologies; crowdsourcing platform; historical archives; Ontology-driven user interfaces","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, the observations produced by context providers (connected objects) are generated with different vocabularies and data formats. This heterogeneity of technologies in the IoT world makes it necessary to adopt generic solutions.

It complements several initiatives to put pattern languages at the service of sustainability and societal change, and to introduce pattern thinking and pattern language into systems thinking and systemic design.My broader aim is to enhance the innate patterning capability of human beings and thus an overall pattern literacy in support of systems literacy. Pattern literacy manifests our ability to grasp, learn, assemble, represent and mobilize patterns to make-sense of, converse about and shape our world(s). Systems literacy manifests our ability to interrogate and attempt to understand the relationships among systems wholes and parts, and the mechanisms that affect and shape our world(s), in part or as a whole.In this paper, I explore how a systemic approach to patterns and pattern language could support systemic inquiry and systemic design, and more generally the advancement of pattern language.In particular, I discuss the extension of the act of design to encompass the systemic inquiry that motivates a design and the on-going monitoring of the fitness of a design to its intended purpose. I examine the multiple facets and understandings of the concept of pattern and show how they can be reconciled to include both the inquiry or observational/informational aspects and the design aspects of patterns in a larger systems framework. In this light, I reexamine the appropriateness of the pattern expressed in problem-solution form in the context of complex systems, and the notion of generativity, and I propose ways forward for extended definitions and pattern forms.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","","","","","","","","PLoP '18","","","","The Hillside Group","USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Portland, Oregon","","","","action research; complex systems; semiotics; boundary objects; complex adaptive modeling; participatory inquiry; pattern language; pattern literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet, few novice-oriented ML modeling tools are designed to foster hands-on learning of dataset design practices, including how to design for data diversity and inspect for data quality. To this end, we outline a set of four data design practices (DDPs) for designing inclusive ML models and share how we designed a tablet-based application called Co-ML to foster learning of DDPs through a collaborative ML model building experience. With Co-ML, beginners can build image classifiers through a distributed experience where data is synchronized across multiple devices, enabling multiple users to iteratively refine ML datasets in discussion and coordination with their peers. We deployed Co-ML in a 2-week-long educational AIML Summer Camp, where youth ages 13–18 worked in groups to build custom ML-powered mobile applications. Our analysis reveals how multi-user model building with Co-ML, in the context of student-driven projects created during the summer camp, supported development of DDPs including incorporating data diversity, evaluating model performance, and inspecting for data quality. Additionally, we found that students’ attempts to improve model performance often prioritized learnability over class balance. Through this work, we highlight how the combination of collaboration, model testing interfaces, and student-driven projects can empower learners to actively engage in exploring the role of data in ML systems.","2024-04","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","","","2","24","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Machine learning; collaboration; data science; computing education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relevant research about it is becoming more and more popular. Ontology-based fault diagnosis is an important method for diagnosing faults. Due to the expressive ability, knowledge sharing and knowledge reuse based on deep semantics, and supporting for logical reasoning, ontology-based fault diagnosis has received more and more attention from researchers in the past decade. The fault diagnosis ontology describes the core concepts involved in diagnosing faults and the relationship among the concepts. Its quality and usage determine the efficiency and effectiveness of fault diagnosis, thus has a great impact on fault diagnosis. However, its knowledge source and usage have not been analyzed comprehensively to give us a deep insight into this area yet. This paper investigates and studies the ontology-based fault diagnosis during the past decade, from the perspective of knowledge source and usage of fault diagnosis ontology. In summary, it can be seen that combining ontology with other methods improves the efficiency and the effect of fault diagnosis, and ontology-based fault diagnosis needs to be integrated into the whole process of fault diagnosis.

The widely used practice is to build task-specific or even dataset-specific solutions, which are hard to generalize and disable the opportunities of knowledge sharing that can be learned from different datasets and multiple tasks. In this paper, we propose Unicorn, a unified model for generally supporting common data matching tasks. Building such a unified model is challenging due to heterogeneous formats of input data elements and various matching semantics of multiple tasks. To address the challenges, Unicorn employs one generic Encoder that converts any pair of data elements (a, b) into a learned representation, and uses a Matcher, which is a binary classifier, to decide whether a matches b. To align matching semantics of multiple tasks, Unicorn adopts a mixture-of-experts model that enhances the learned representation into a better representation. We conduct extensive experiments using 20 datasets on 7 well-studied data matching tasks, and find that our unified model can achieve better performance on most tasks and on average, compared with the state-of-the-art specific models trained for ad-hoc tasks and datasets separately. Moreover, Unicorn can also well serve new matching tasks with zero-shot learning.","2024-05","2025-09-10 14:12:07","2025-09-10 14:12:07","","44–53","","1","53","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We then cluster editing activities to identify user roles in monthly time frames. Finally, we explore how each role impacts the ontology. Our analysis shows that the Wikidata ontology has uneven breadth and depth. We identified two user roles: contributors and leaders.

This research introduces a methodology named TTPXHunter for automated extraction of threat intelligence in terms of Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) from finished cyber threat reports. It leverages cyber domain-specific state-of-the-art natural language model to augment sentences for minority class TTPs and refine pinpointing the TTPs in threat analysis reports significantly. We create two datasets: an augmented sentence-TTP dataset of (39,296) sentence samples and a (149) real-world cyber threat intelligence report-to-TTP dataset. Further, we evaluate TTPXHunter on the augmented sentence and report datasets. The TTPXHunter achieves the highest performance of (92.42%) f1-score on the augmented dataset, and it also outperforms existing state-of-the-art TTP extraction method by achieving an f1-score of (97.09%) when evaluated over the report dataset.

In order to further enhance the classification performance, we investigated the following models incorporating distinct features: (1) We devised a novel protein feature called AAC_PSSM by amalgamating amino acid composition (AAC) and position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) features. Subsequently, a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was employed to learn such features; (2) An ensemble model was constructed by combining the existing GRU model with the model of a neural network featuring the AAC feature; (3) Random forest analysis was conducted using the pseudo-amino acid composition (PseAAC) feature; (4) Furthermore, we explored a natural language processing (NLP) approach by considering the protein sequence as a natural language and applying various neural network architectures.

In existing literature, a growing interest on establishment of automated testing techniques has been observed. However, tedious manual process of test case generation largely depends upon domain knowledge and formalized representation of user requirements. The advent of semantic web engineering has led the foundation for developing ontologies as a mean to express information and knowledge semantics regarding particular domain efficiently. In software testing, ontologies can be significantly helpful to automate testing phase as they encode domain knowledge in machine interpretable format. We have proposed automatic test case generation framework that involves ontology-based requirement specification and learning based methods for conducting black box testing. Our approach integrates knowledge-based system (ontology) with learning-based testing algorithm to automate: generation of test cases, test execution and test verdict construction. Proposed framework includes, requirement ontology to formalize requirement specification, Dialogue Manager that enables selection of available test cases and Learning Based Testing to generate counter examples of test cases through system learning. The contribution of this paper is to enable 1) requirement elicitation and specification using ontologies 2) test data selection from existing ontologies and 3) automatic test case generation from existing test cases. To represent the applicability of this research, ontology for requirement elicitation and specification is developed.

Most cloud service providers abstract troubleshooting into predefined workflows for different incidents, offering step-by-step guidance. However, manually crafting workflows is resource-consuming and knowledge-intensive, hindering large-scale deployment. Most automated techniques for workflow orchestration rely on large language models (LLMs) to handle complex tasks but overlook key aspects of troubleshooting, including complex expertise, domain requirements, and the reliability of AI feedback. These limitations undermine workflow quality. Therefore, we propose FlowXpert, a novel framework for troubleshooting workflow orchestration. Leveraging LLMs, it first builds a knowledge base centered on incident-aware nodes to precisely depict expertise. Then, fed into AI feedback and synthetic preference data, reinforcement learning is applied to refine the workflow generator and evaluator. To assess troubleshooting workflows, we introduce OpsFlowBench based on Huawei Cloud's datacenter switch operation documents. Benchmark tests under the tailored STEPScore metric validate its effectiveness.

Existing KG embedding models, however, merely focus on representing one of the two views alone. In this paper, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, JOIE, with the goal to produce better knowledge embedding and enable new applications that rely on multi-view knowledge. JOIE employs both cross-view and intra-view modeling that learn on multiple facets of the knowledge base. The cross-view association model is learned to bridge the embeddings of ontological concepts and their corresponding instance-view entities. The intra-view models are trained to capture the structured knowledge of instance and ontology views in separate embedding spaces, with a hierarchy-aware encoding technique enabled for ontologies with hierarchies. We explore multiple representation techniques for the two model components and investigate with nine variants of JOIE. Our model is trained on large-scale knowledge bases that consist of massive instances and their corresponding ontological concepts connected via a (small) set of cross-view links. Experimental results on public datasets show that the best variant of JOIE significantly outperforms previous models on instance-view triple prediction task as well as ontology population on ontology-view KG. In addition, our model successfully extends the use of KG embeddings to entity typing with promising performance.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","1709–1719","","","","","","","KDD '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Anchorage, AK, USA","","","","knowledge graph; ontology learning; relational embeddings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We reviewed the different solutions proposed as well as the existing tools by using the NoSQL and the Map-Reduce paradigm implemented in Hadoop and Spark.We then looked at the concept of ontology, starting by recalling the definition of ontology, so an ontology is a conceptual model to represent reality and on which it is possible to develop systems that can be shared and reused. Ontologies are used to represent a domain and reason about its entities.Finally, we presented and discussed some research works that combined ontologies and Big Data.

But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today.The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way.The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","","","","33","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers are exploring advanced data and knowledge management methods, with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) emerging as a promising solution. KGs represent data in a way that reflects human understanding, promoting natural human-machine interactions and enhancing AI’s insights. Their structure and constraints are defined by a vocabulary or ontology. This paper presents ongoing work towards enriching an existing Electric Vehicle Knowledge Graph (EVKG), which is specified by the Electric Vehicle Ontology (EVO). To achieve this, we utilized the Python programming language to create labels for each resource in the EVKG. These labels were then used to match and link these resources to their corresponding entries in DBpedia through the use of the owl:sameAs and rdfs:seeAlso properties. To ensure the matching was as accurate as possible, we developed two algorithms: one employing string matching and the other using word vectorization and distance techniques.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","","","","","","","","SETN '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Ontology; Knowledge Graph; Linked Data; Electric Vehicles; EVO Ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

New possibilities are now offered for addressing complex interaction problems between the technology and users with special needs. Within this context, this study addresses human-computer interactions for cognitive assistance to people with Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI). Interdisciplinary research combining computer science and occupational therapy was conducted to model the interaction between an AAL system (AALS) and a person with cognitive impairments due to TBI residing in an AAL environment. Cognitive assistance is modelled as an interactive exchange where an AALS spreads assistance cues that should induce appropriate behaviours from an assisted person as responses. After an assistance cue is delivered, the AALS should evaluate the user reaction and, stop the interaction if the intended reaction is observed or resume by adapting the assistance. To do so, evidence-based cognitive rehabilitation and speech acts are used to model the interaction content i.e., assistive cues and user feedback, while an ontology formalizes the semantics of this knowledge in a computer readable format. A behavioural model based on behaviour trees informed by the ontological model is then used to enable the cognitive assistant to plan the sequence of cues to be delivered adaptively depending on the circumstances, the assistance goal and the user's behaviour. To show that the proposed interaction model can help an AALS to provide adaptive assistance to people with cognitive impairments, it is exemplified on a cooking safety assistant designed for people with TBI.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","183–192","","","","","","","HAI '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Japan","","","","Speech acts; Cognitive assistance; Ambient intelligence; interactive information retrieval; Ontology-based decision support; Traumatic Brain Injury","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The set of keywords is expanded via semantic search within a cross-domain ontology, e.g. DBpedia, allowing more researchers with indirect relationships to be connected.

Four versions of this network were tested: unweighted, weighted, semantically expanded, and reduced semantically expanded. It was found that weights have an insignificant role in community detection within this study. In addition, a semantically expanded network does have better clustering potentials but only if was performed selectively.

The latter parameters are aggregated through the well known PMV index. In this paper, we introduce a wireless sensor network (WSN)-based comfort measurement approach, called OnCom, using a dedicated ontology and the emotional state analysis of the occupant to reach the ""adequate"" indoor thermal comfort.

Patient symptoms are typically found in unstructured notes, and thus not readily available for clinical decision making. In an attempt to fill this gap, this study compared two methods for symptom extraction from Emergency Department (ED) admission notes. Both methods utilized a lexicon derived by expanding The Center for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Symptoms of Coronavirus list. The first method utilized a word2vec model to expand the lexicon using a dictionary mapping to the Uni ed Medical Language System (UMLS). The second method utilized the expanded lexicon as a rule-based gazetteer and the UMLS. These methods were evaluated against a manually annotated reference (f1-score of 0.87 for UMLS-based ensemble; and 0.85 for rule-based gazetteer with UMLS). Through analyses of associations of extracted symptoms used as features against various outcomes, salient risks among the population of COVID-19 patients, including increased risk of in-hospital mortality (OR 1.85, p-value &lt; 0.001), were identified for patients presenting with dyspnea. Disparities between English and non-English speaking patients were also identified, the most salient being a concerning finding of opposing risk signals between fatigue and in-hospital mortality (non-English: OR 1.95, p-value = 0.02; English: OR 0.63, p-value = 0.01). While use of symptomatology for modeling of outcomes is not unique, unlike previous studies this study showed that models built using symptoms with the outcome of in-hospital mortality were not significantly different from models using data collected during an in-patient encounter (AUC of 0.9 with 95% CI of [0.88, 0.91] using only vital signs; AUC of 0.87 with 95% CI of [0.85, 0.88] using only symptoms). These findings indicate that prognostic models based on symptomatology could aid in extending COVID-19 patient care through telemedicine, replacing the need for in-person options. The methods presented in this study have potential for use in development of symptomatology-based models for other diseases, including for the study of Post-Acute Sequelae of COVID-19 (PASC).","2022-01","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","429–474","","","72","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: El Segundo, CA, USA Publisher: AI Access Foundation","","","","Information extraction; Natural language processing; COVID-19; UMLS","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This growing interest is mainly due to the promise that the use of blockchain enables it to be verified, without including any trusted intermediaries, that the information received from the network is authentic and up-to-date. In this respect, blockchain is a distributed database that can be seen as a ledger that records all transactions that have ever been executed. In this context, smart contracts are pieces of software used to facilitate, verify, and enforce the negotiation of a transaction on a blockchain platform. These pieces of software are implemented by using programming languages, which are sometimes provided by the blockchain platforms themselves. This study aims to (1) identify and categorise the state-of-the-art related to smart contract languages, in terms of the existing languages and their main features, and (2) identify new research opportunities. The review has been conducted as a multivocal mapping study that follows the guidelines proposed by Garousi et&nbsp;al. for conducting multivocal literature reviews, as well as the guidelines proposed by Kitchenham and Charters for conducting mapping studies.

What value do these bring to text analysis, either in modelling or in task definitions?

Existing methods, mostly supervised, face challenges in obtaining labeled entity pairs. To address this, recent studies have shifted towards self-supervised and unsupervised frameworks. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches have limitations: (1) Relation passing: mainly focusing on the entity while neglecting the semantic information of relations, (2) Isomorphic assumption: assuming isomorphism between source and target graphs, which leads to noise and reduced alignment accuracy, and (3) Noise vulnerability: susceptible to noise in the textual features, especially when encountering inconsistent translations or Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) problems. In this paper, we propose ERAlign, an unsupervised and robust cross-lingual EA pipeline that jointly performs &lt;u&gt;E&lt;/u&gt;ntity-level and &lt;u&gt;R&lt;/u&gt;elation-level &lt;u&gt;Align&lt;/u&gt;ment by neighbor triple matching strategy using semantic textual features of relations and entities. Its refinement step iteratively enhances results by fusing entity-level and relation-level alignments based on neighbor triple matching. The additional verification step examines the entities' neighbor triples as the linearized text. This Align-then-Verify pipeline rigorously assesses alignment results, achieving near-perfect alignment even in the presence of noisy textual features of entities. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that the robustness and general applicability of ERAlign improved the accuracy and effectiveness of EA tasks, contributing significantly to knowledge-oriented applications.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","184–193","","","","","","","WSDM '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hannover, Germany","","","","knowledge graph; pretrained language models; optimal transport; cross-lingual entity alignment; neighbor triple matching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most previous work has gone into hardware abstraction, while service abstraction has been neglected. This paper presents an information discovery mechanism for BOSs that is based on an ontology which integrates with other semantic models used in the space. The built environment is characterized by extreme heterogeneity; no buildings are entirely alike. Equipment is replaced or updated, control systems and building functionality evolve, as applications, models, forecasters, and controllers improve. For services deployed in such settings to operate at a scale, they must be robust to change. Describing service interfaces using a semantic model, together with the physical context in a building, enables applications to query for their service dependencies. Applications then depend on an abstract query, instead of specific services. For evaluation, nine services running on models of the service ecosystems of three concrete buildings, are implemented, demonstrated, and discussed. Results show services have successfully been made portable and adapts to the changing environments of buildings. Merging and splitting services without code changes to depending services also work as intended, as well as increasing system resilience, by arbitrating similar services.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","110–117","","","","","","","IoT '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: St.Gallen, Switzerland","","","","Ontology; Service Discovery; Dependency Resolution.; Information Discovery; Service Abstraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the black-box nature of such pretrained language models obscures the agent's reasoning and its motivations when responding, leading to unexplained dialogues. We develop a belief-desire-intention (BDI) agent as a task-oriented dialogue system to introduce mental attitudes similar to humans describing their behavior during a dialogue.

The resulting security application reference model can serve as a basis and reference for improving system confidentiality, integrity, and availability, as well as facilitating the design, analysis, and verification of security against malicious attacks. Moreover, the research method employed in this paper is also applicable to information security research of other types of information systems.

It currently hosts material from more than 30 countries and from a variety of archival institutions (such as State archives, city archives, university and parish archives, private institutions, and more). It is maintained by the Archives Portal Europe Foundation, an international consortium of State archives and other archival institutions that aim to connect the archival material of single institutions into one digital repository to allow universal access to the archival heritage of Europe, promoting new forms of archival research beyond national or local boundaries. One of the research tools made available by Archives Portal Europe is by topics; however, these are currently maintained manually by the archivists, and the vast amount of archival material ingested in the portal makes it impossible to have a comprehensive body of topics that describe the whole of the APE repository. Archives are traditionally not organised by their subject content, but around the entity (person, organization, body) that created and/or collected the documents in the course of their activities. While this is an undisputed pillar of archival management, the availability of online digital repositories for archival research requires new tools for digital archival research, particularly when different archival traditions from different countries and different types of institutions are merged into a unique research portal. Topic detection becomes a fundamental tool to guide archival research and to allow archives to be accessible to potentially world-wide users in a situation where national and linguistics barriers blur or are re-defined. This article presents the preliminary results and plan for future iterations of an AI tool for automated topic detection in a multi- lingual environment, where human-created taxonomies act as bases for the algorithms to aggregate relevant material around a specific topic.

The context of Southern Chinese martial arts is of particular significance, as it carries immaterial components of all these aspects: The technical and stylistic framework of a martial art system; the imagery associated to movements; and the transmission of knowledge orally, practically, or through influence, are but examples of intangible characteristics that can and should be captured, not unlike cultural artifacts. The latter case—the one of formalizing cultural influence through its various forms of evidenceis emblematic as well as largely untrodden ground. A previous attempt at detecting cultural influence computationally was made in the context of Roman archaeology, though the binding of that early effort with the domain model was tight; also, there has hardly been any prior dedicated effort to model the martial arts domain through ontologies. In this article, we present the realization of the full cycle of a computational approach to investigating cultural contact in Southern Chinese martial arts. The entire approach is predicated upon the usage of standards and techniques of the Semantic Web and formal knowledge. Starting from a modular domain ontology, which models martial arts independently of the goal of capturing cultural influence, we perform knowledge extraction from archival material from the Hong Kong Martial Arts Living Archive and generate a dataset of the results modeled after said ontology. Then, we combine the resulting knowledge base with a rule model that represents ways to infer knowledge of potential contact between cultures based on the evidence present in the knowledge base. The results offer an insight into how an inference-based computational model can be applied to detect interesting facts even in the as-yet underexplored domain of intangible cultural heritage. The implemented workflow shows that the full-cycle employment of semantic technologies can offer the ground truth required for largely different approaches, such as statistical and machine learning ones, to operate.","2023-08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Semantic Web; ontologies; knowledge representation; Intangible cultural heritage; digitization; embodied knowledge; inferencing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The phenomenon, described by the World Health Organization (WHO) as an ""indodemic"" presents a serious challenge to governments and public health authorities, but the spread of misinformation has made human detection less efficient than the rate of spread. While there have been many studies developing automated detection techniques for COVID-19 fake news, the results often refer to high accuracy but rarely to model detection time. This research uses fuzzy theory to extract features and uses multiple deep learning model frameworks to detect Chinese and English COVID-19 misinformation. With the reduction of text features, the detection time of the model is significantly reduced, and the model accuracy does not drop excessively. This study designs two different feature extraction methods based on fuzzy classification and compares the results with different deep learning models. BiLSTM was found to provide the best detection results for COVID-19 misinformation by directly using deep learning models, with 99% accuracy in English and 86% accuracy in Chinese.

Such scenarios require nearly all of the terms in the ontology to be forgotten, which poses a significant challenge to forgetting tools. In this paper we show that modularization and forgetting can be combined beneficially in order to compute ontology extracts. While a module is a subset of axioms of a given ontology, the solution of forgetting (also known as a uniform interpolant) is a compact representation of the ontology limited to a subset of the signature. The approach introduced in this paper uses an iterative workflow of four stages: (i) extension of the given signature and, if needed partitioning, (ii) modularization, (iii) forgetting, and (iv) evaluation by domain expert. For modularization we use three kinds of modules: locality-based, semantic and minimal subsumption modules. For forgetting three tools are used: NUI, LETHE and FAME. An evaluation on the SNOMED CT and NCIt ontologies for standard concept name lists showed that precomputing ontology modules reduces the number of terms that need to be forgotten. An advantage of the presented approach is high precision of the computed ontology extracts.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:08","2025-09-10 14:12:08","","45–52","","","","","","","K-CAP '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Marina Del Rey, CA, USA","","","","knowledge management; knowledge representation and reasoning; forgetting; uniform interpolation; description logics; knowledge abstraction; ontology abstraction; ontology modularity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A new aspect is artificial intelligence, which Smart Cities could greatly benefit from. A central problem for urban designers is the unavailability of data to make relevant decisions. Agent-based simulations enable a view of the dynamic properties of the urban system, generating data in its course. However, the simulation must remain sufficiently simple to remain in the realm of computability. The research question of this paper is: How can we make agents behave more realistically to analyze citizens’ mobility behavior? To solve this problem, we first created a simulated virtual environment, where agents can move freely in a small part of a city, the harbor area in Hamburg, Germany. We assumed that happiness is a crucial motivating factor for the movement of citizens. A survey of 130 citizens provided the weights that govern the simulated environment and the happiness score assignation of places. As an AI method, we then used Reinforcement Learning as a general model and Q-learning as an algorithm to generate a baseline. Through randomly traversing the model environment a baseline was created. We are in the process of enhancing Reinforcement Learning with a Deep Q-Network to make the actors learn. Early experiments show a significant improvement over a tabular Q-learning approach. This paper contributes to the literature of urban planning, and data-driven architectural design. The main contribution is replacing the inefficient search for a global maximum of the happiness function, with an efficient local solution global maximum. This has implications for further research in the generation of synthetic data through simulations.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","20–25","","","","","","","CIIS '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tokyo, Japan","","","","artificial intelligence; agent-based modeling; synthetic data; smart cities; city simulations; urban design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

GOGCN is a graph-based approach that performs sufficient representation learning for terms and relations in the GO graph. First, GOGCN employs the GCN-based knowledge graph embedding (KGE) model to learn vector representations (i.e., embeddings) for all entities (i.e., terms). Second, GOGCN calculates the semantic similarity between two terms based on their corresponding vector representations. Finally, GOGCN estimates gene functional similarity by making use of the pair-wise strategy. During the representation learning period, GOGCN promotes semantic interaction between terms through GCN, thereby capturing the rich structural information of the GO graph. Further experimental results on various datasets suggest that GOGCN is superior to the other state-of-the-art approaches, which shows its reliability and effectiveness.","2022-06","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","1053–1064","","2","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Washington, DC, USA Publisher: IEEE Computer Society Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Determining who is involved, what activity is performed, and when and where the activity occurs are critical to understanding group processes in greater depth, including supporting goal-oriented applications (e.g., performance, productivity, and mental health) that require sensing social factors. In this work, we propose W4-Groups that captures the functional perspective of variability and repeatability when automatically constructing short-term and long-term groups via multiple data sources (e.g., WiFi and location check-in data). We design and implement W4-Groups to detect and extract all four group features who-what-when-where from the user's daily mobility patterns. We empirically evaluate the framework using two real-world WiFi datasets and a location check-in dataset, yielding an average of 92% overall accuracy, 96% precision, and 94% recall.

Amplio includes three human-in-the-loop data augmentation techniques: Augment with Concepts, Augment by Interpolation, and Augment with Large Language Model. In a user study with 18 professional red teamers, we demonstrate the utility of our augmentation methods in helping generate high-quality, diverse, and relevant model safety prompts. We find that Amplio enabled red teamers to augment data quickly and creatively, highlighting the transformative potential of interactive augmentation workflows.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","","","","","","","","CHI '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","language models; data diversity; Human-in-the-loop data augmentation; interactive visualization; sparse autoencoders","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper is a theoretical analysis aimed at informing the development of games that help improve critical literacy around text-to-image models. It asks: what assumptions and perspectives do text-to-image models have on visual creativity, and how do we bring that out through games? We propose a theory to differentiate between seeing an image through the expression of color, shapes and lines, and seeing an image through the recognition of concepts and ideas. These two ways of seeing are two different ways of orienting the player/user to their visual creativity. While traditional painting mechanics emphasize the former, text-to-image interfaces emphasize the latter. We deploy this perspective to study games with traditional painting interactions and games with text-to-image interactions. This paper hopes to contribute to design both broadly for games about visual creativity, and narrowly for gameplay with text-to-image models — specifically, how the latter fosters a different type of visual creativity than traditional painting interactions.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","","","","","","","","FDG '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Worcester, MA, USA","","","","Painting; Game Design; Stable Diffusion; Text-to-Image; Visual Creativity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As much as the experimentation processes have been used in industry and academia, there is a lack of formalization of the principles of ESE teaching and artifacts that can be useful to support it in higher education. One of the means to contribute to such a topic would be the design of a conceptual model, which is widely discussed in the literature, thus applying empirical methods for a better understanding of the context and representation of ESE teaching. Thus, in this paper, we developed a conceptual model to support the teaching of controlled experiments and quasi-experiments. To design the conceptual model, we carried out an analysis of metadata from controlled experiments and quasi-experiments in the literature and conducted a survey to collect data from instructors who teach ESE.

Traditional QA benchmarks are often static and publicly available, making them susceptible to data contamination and memorization by large language models (LLMs). Consequently, static benchmarks may overestimate model generalization and hinder a reliable assessment of real-world performance. In this work, we introduce Dynamic-KGQA, a scalable framework for generating adaptive QA datasets from knowledge graphs (KGs), designed to mitigate memorization risks while maintaining statistical consistency across iterations. Unlike fixed benchmarks, Dynamic-KGQA generates a new dataset variant on every run while preserving the underlying distribution, enabling fair and reproducible evaluations. Furthermore, our framework provides fine-grained control over dataset characteristics, supporting domain-specific and topic-focused QA dataset generation. Additionally, Dynamic-KGQA produces compact, semantically coherent subgraphs that facilitate both training and evaluation of KGQA models, enhancing their ability to leverage structured knowledge effectively. To align with existing evaluation protocols, we also provide static large-scale train/test/validation splits, ensuring comparability with prior methods. By introducing a dynamic, customizable benchmarking paradigm, Dynamic-KGQA enables a more rigorous and adaptable evaluation of QA systems.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","3498–3508","","","","","","","SIGIR '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Padua, Italy","","","","knowledge graphs; large language models; benchmark; dynamic evaluation; kgqa; question answering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relational topic models (RTMs) have shown promise on citation prediction via joint modeling of document contents and citations. However, existing RTMs can only capture pairwise or direct (first-order) citation relationships among documents. The indirect (high-order) citation links have been explored in graph neural network–based methods, but these methods suffer from the well-known explainability problem. In this article, we propose a model called Graph Neural Collaborative Topic Model that takes advantage of both relational topic models and graph neural networks to capture high-order citation relationships and to have higher explainability due to the latent topic semantic structure. Experiments on three real-world citation datasets show that our model outperforms several competitive baseline methods on citation recommendation.

They typically represent users by the products they visited in a short span of time using attentive models and lack the ability to exploit relational information such as user-product interactions or item co-occurrence relations. In this work, we propose to address the limitations of prior arts by exploring local and global user behavior patterns on a user successive behavior graph, which is constructed by utilizing short-term actions of all users. To capture implicit user preference signals and collaborative patterns, we use an efficient jumping graph convolution to explore high-order relations to enrich product representations for user preference modeling. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated with existing latent space based methods and be potentially applied in any product retrieval method that uses purchase history to model user preferences.

Interactive question answering is a recently proposed and increasingly popular solution that resides at the intersection of question answering and dialogue systems. On the one hand, the user can ask questions in normal language and locate the actual response to her inquiry; on the other hand, the system can prolong the question-answering session into a dialogue if there are multiple probable replies, very few, or ambiguities in the initial request. By permitting the user to ask more questions, interactive question answering enables users to interact with the system and receive more precise results dynamically.This survey offers a detailed overview of the interactive question-answering methods that are prevalent in current literature.

It is therefore important to teach students MDE skills in an effective manner to prepare them for future careers in academia and industry. The use of interactive online tools can help instructors deliver course material to more students in a more efficient manner, allowing them to offload repetitive or tedious tasks to these systems and focus on other teaching activities that cannot be easily automated. Interactive online tools can provide students with a more engaging learning experience than static resources like books or written exercises. Domain modeling with class diagrams is a fundamental modeling activity in MDE. While there exist multiple modeling tools that allow students to build a domain model, none of them offer an interactive learning experience. In this paper, we explore the interactions between a student modeler and an interactive domain modeling assistant with the aim of better understanding the required interaction.

Existing solutions for specifying NFRs are based on a graphical representation that requires manual efforts. Furthermore, they do not take into account the classification of the types of conflicting NFRs that helps to prioritize NFRs. In addition, these approaches are not used in industrial practice due to three main reasons viz. 1) High manual inference 2) Sharing and reusing work can be difficult and 3) No support for machine understanding.

To alleviate this weakness, we propose an Arabic knowledge enriched reader model, which fuses external knowledge into contextual representation using an attention and gating mechanism. We learn and generate Arabic knowledge graph embeddings that represent information from Arabic Wikidata and utilize this representation when fusing knowledge. We adopted a knowledge graph embedding scoring function to select the most relevant concepts to the context from the knowledge graph.

However, there are limited studies in this area for sound generation. In this study, we investigate generating sound conditioned on a text prompt and propose a novel text-to-sound generation framework that consists of a text encoder, a Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE), a token-decoder, and a vocoder. The framework first uses the token-decoder to transfer the text features extracted from the text encoder to a mel-spectrogram with the help of VQ-VAE, and then the vocoder is used to transform the generated mel-spectrogram into a waveform. We found that the token-decoder significantly influences the generation performance. Thus, we focus on designing a good token-decoder in this study. We begin with the traditional autoregressive (AR) token-decoder. However, the AR token-decoder always predicts the mel-spectrogram tokens one by one in order, which may introduce the unidirectional bias and accumulation of errors problems. Moreover, with the AR token-decoder, the sound generation time increases linearly with the sound duration. To overcome the shortcomings introduced by AR token-decoders, we propose a non-autoregressive token-decoder based on the discrete diffusion model, named Diffsound. Specifically, the Diffsound model predicts all of the mel-spectrogram tokens in one step and then refines the predicted tokens in the next step, so the best-predicted results can be obtained by iteration. Our experiments show that our proposed Diffsound model not only produces better generation results when compared with the AR token-decoder but also has a faster generation speed, &lt;italic&gt;i.e.&lt;/italic&gt;, MOS: 3.56 &lt;italic&gt;v.s&lt;/italic&gt; 2.786.","2023-04","2025-09-10 14:12:09","2025-09-10 14:12:09","","1720–1733","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Consider, for example, how droughts and water reserves affect crop production and how agriculture and industrial needs affect water quality and availability. Preventive measures, such as delaying planting dates and adopting new agricultural practices in response to changing weather patterns, can reduce the damage caused by natural processes. Understanding how these natural and human processes affect one another allows forecasting the effects of undesirable situations and study interventions to take preventive measures. For many of these processes, there are expert models that incorporate state-of-the-art theories and knowledge to quantify a system's response to a diversity of conditions. A major challenge for efficient modeling is the diversity of modeling approaches across disciplines and the wide variety of data sources available only in formats that require complex conversions. Using expert models for particular problems requires integration of models with third-party data as well as integration of models across disciplines. Modelers face significant heterogeneity that requires resolving semantic, spatiotemporal, and execution mismatches, which are largely done by hand today and may take more than 2 years of effort.We are developing a modeling framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to reduce modeling effort while ensuring utility for decision making. Our work to date makes several innovative contributions: (1) an intelligent user interface that guides analysts to frame their modeling problem and assists them by suggesting relevant choices and automating steps along the way; (2) semantic metadata for models, including their modeling variables and constraints, that ensures model relevance and proper use for a given decision-making problem; and (3) semantic representations of datasets in terms of modeling variables that enable automated data selection and data transformations.

In this paper, we reconstruct MLT* with the deductive axiomatization style used for DeepTelos. The resulting specification is executed in a deductive database to check MLT* multi-level models for errors and complete them with derived facts that do not have to be explicitly asserted by modelers. This leverages the rich rules of MLT* with the deductive approach underlying DeepTelos. The effort also allows us to clearly establish the relation between DeepTelos and MLT*, in an attempt to clarify the relations between approaches in this research domain.

In this study, we aim to demonstrate (1) the use of a causal framework and (2) contrast frequentist methods with more sophisticated Bayesian statistics for causal inference. To this end, we reanalyze the only known controlled experiment investigating the impact of passive voice on the subsequent activity of domain modeling. We follow a framework for statistical causal inference and employ Bayesian data analysis methods to re-investigate the hypotheses of the original study. Our results reveal that the effects observed by the original authors turned out to be much less significant than previously assumed.

A larger window can lead to higher frequency resolution and potentially better enhancement. This however incurs an algorithmic latency of 32 ms in an online setup, because the overlap-add algorithm used in the inverse STFT (iSTFT) is also performed using the same window size. To reduce this inherent latency, we adapt a conventional dual-window-size approach, where a regular input window size is used for STFT but a shorter output window is used for overlap-add, for STFT-domain deep learning based frame-online speech enhancement. Based on this STFT-iSTFT configuration, we employ complex spectral mapping for frame-online enhancement, where a deep neural network (DNN) is trained to predict the real and imaginary (RI) components of target speech from the mixture RI components. In addition, we use the DNN-predicted RI components to conduct frame-online beamforming, the results of which are used as extra features for a second DNN to perform frame-online postfiltering. The frequency-domain beamformer can be easily integrated with our DNNs and is designed to not incur any algorithmic latency. Additionally, we propose a future-frame prediction technique to further reduce the algorithmic latency. Evaluation on noisy-reverberant speech enhancement shows the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Compared with Conv-TasNet, our STFT-domain system can achieve better enhancement performance for a comparable amount of computation, or comparable performance with less computation, maintaining strong performance at an algorithmic latency as low as 2 ms.","2022-11","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","397–410","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To deal with this issue, a number of systems and techniques for identifying plant diseases have been proposed. However, most of them mainly concentrate on image-based pattern recognition rather than focusing on the observed abnormalities of plant diseases. In other words, they have not employed ontology for semantic detection of plant disease. Current systems do not support farmers to find disease names w.r.t. the semantics of an infected plant. In this work, we proposed an ontology-based approach to modeling plant diseases and demonstrate our approach by developing a rice disease ontology. The ontology helps identifying plant diseases from existing symptoms on plants. To construct the ontology, we reused the domain knowledge related to symptoms of plant diseases from reliable sources.

The fundamental concept of MBSE is to develop and use consistent models of the system under development, referred to as named system models, as a cross-sectional and cross-discipline platform for information transfer. With the implementation and popularization of MBSE, the industry has put forward higher requirements for the quality of system models. Due to the lack of system model evaluation theory, the quality of the model is opaque, and different stakeholders have different evaluation results for the same model product. This defeats the purpose of using models instead of documents, which is to ensure a consistent exchange of information, and then seriously hinders the use and delivery of the model. Therefore, this study analyzes the characteristics of the system and model and the application of the system model, forming an evaluation index system for SysML system models. It provides practitioners using SysML with systematic theory and practical general methods to solve these problems, and provides a reference for practitioners using different languages to evaluate the quality of MBSE models.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","200–206","","","","","","","ICCSMT '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xi'an, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Changes in product requirements therefore lead to big manual efforts for adapting the manufacturing process and reconfiguring production resources accordingly. Existing approaches do not cope well with this complexity. This hinders agile, customer-oriented manufacturing. A promising approach for automated assembling processes is the Machine as a Service paradigm, which aims for providing production resources on demand. This requires a consistent and pervasive formalization of product specifications, the corresponding manufacturing resources and their interdependencies. Thus, our first contribution is a generic and extensible multi-level and modular modeling framework to formalize products and available resources. Our framework is scalable for large companies and enables reuse for cross-company collaboration and supplier integration. Thereby, the static relationship between product, process and resource is avoided by describing product features and resource skills in separate models. Our framework uses the standardized SysML/UML. Our second contribution is the ability of our framework to integrate different standards. For demonstration, we apply our multi-level approach to a flexible assembly of terminal boxes for transmission gears and show the integration of standards by embedding the eCl@ss classification.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","","","","","","","","ISCSIC '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Stockholm, Sweden","","","","Asset Administration Shell; Industry 4.0 Components; Integration of Ontologies; Language Adaption and Aggregation; Machine as a Service; Multi-level Modeling; PPR Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Documenting products and their development, e.g., creating requirement specifications, is an indispensable, time-consuming and resource-intensive activity in large organizations. A vast amount of related information often emerges across several siloing lifecycle tools, and only a portion of it is available in the post-hoc documentation. Additionally, numerous product lines and versions additionally increase the documentation effort. To tackle these issues in a research project, we developed a semi-automatic end-to-end documentation system, able to generate documents based on templates and structured data. As a use case for document generation, we employ the RDF-based lifecycle tool integration standard OSLC and add extended publishing information. In order to generate target documents, we leverage DITA, an established digital publishing standard. A pilot implementation demonstrates that the approach is able to extract distributed lifecycle data and to generate several types of documents in multiple formats. Since the method can also be used to generate documents from arbitrary RDF graphs, the results can be generalized to other domains beyond software development. We believe that the results support the change from a document-driven to a data-driven documentation paradigm in large organizations.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","2293–2302","","","","","","","SAC '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Limassol, Cyprus","","","","ontology; linked data; digital publishing; product documentation; tool integration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This data constitutes a valuable source of insights for studies into misinformation spread, bias reinforcement, echo chambers or political agenda setting. Computational methods, mostly from the field of NLP, have emerged that tackle a wide range of tasks in this context, including argument and opinion mining, claim detection, checkworthiness detection, stance detection or fact verification. However, computational models require robust definitions of classes and concepts under investigation. Thus, these computational tasks require a strong interdisciplinary and epistemological foundation, specifically with respect to the underlying definitions of key concepts such as claims, arguments, stances, check-worthiness or veracity. This requires a highly interdisciplinary approach combining expertise from fields such as communication studies, computational linguistics and computer science. As opposed to facts, claims are inherently more complex. Their interpretation strongly depends on the context and a variety of intentional or unintended meanings, where terminology and conceptual understandings strongly diverge across communities. From a computational perspective, in order to address this complexity, the synergy of multiple approaches, coming both from symbolic (knowledge representation) and statistical AI seem to be promising to tackle such challenges. This workshop aims at strengthening the relations between these communities, providing a forum for shared works on the modeling, extraction and analysis of discourse on the Web. It will address the need for a shared understanding and structured knowledge about discourse data in order to enable machine-interpretation, discoverability and reuse, in support of scientific or journalistic studies into the analysis of societal debates on the Web.

Our key observation is that the similarity among the projects alludes to the existence of a veritable domain of discourse whose ontology, if created, would make the similarity across the projects explicit. Design diagrams are an integral part of any commercial software project deliverables as they document crucial facets of the software solution. We propose an approach to extract ontological information from UML design diagrams (class and sequence diagrams) and represent it as domain ontology in a convenient representation.

Existing efforts to build a geospatial KG, have mainly used sparse spatial relationships, e.g., a district located inside a city, which provide only marginal benefits compared to a traditional database. In spite of the substantial advances in the tasks of link prediction and knowledge graph completion, identifying geospatial relationships remains challenging, particularly due to the fact that spatial entities are represented with single-point geometries, and textual attributes are frequently missing. In this study, we present GTMiner, a novel framework capable of jointly modeling Geospatial and Textual information to construct a knowledge graph, by mining three useful spatial relationships from a geospatial database, in an end-to-end fashion. The system is divided into three components: (1) a Candidate Selection module, to efficiently select a small number of candidate pairs; (2) a Relation Prediction component to predict spatial relationships between the entities; (3) a KG Refinement procedure, to improve both coverage and correctness of a geospatial knowledge graph. We carry out experiments on four cities' geospatial databases, from publicly-available sources and compare with existing algorithms for link prediction and geospatial data integration. Finally, we conduct an ablation study to motivate our design choices and an efficiency analysis to show that the time required by GTMiner for training and inference is comparable, or even shorter, than existing solutions.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; model; knowledge; learning; information; prediction; text; representation; language; area; geokg; geometry; geospatial; graph; interest; kg; of; poi; point; pois; relation; relationship; relationships; spatial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in a distributed environment, a relatively static multi-agent interaction model is not sufficient to support a dynamically changing interaction process. Frequent data interactions will also consume resources of multi-agent systems, thereby reducing agent performance. In this study, we propose a semantic-based multiagent dynamic interaction model (MADIM). MADIM uses semantic ontology to map the objects in the interaction model, and defines the interaction protocol through the rule description language. This model is attached with dynamically configurable semantic templates and interaction rule base. We added a reusable dynamic resolution engine component to MADIM to provide dynamic resolution services for the semantic information in the model. MADIM supports dynamic interactive behavior and has good interoperability and interpretability. Our model provides a flexible solution to the multi-agent interaction process.

We first introduce the concepts of model positionality and computational reflexivity that can help data scientists to reflect on and communicate the social and cultural context of a model’s development and use, the data annotators and their annotations, and the data scientists themselves. We then describe the unique challenges of adapting these concepts for data science work and offer annotator fingerprinting and position mining as promising solutions. Finally, we demonstrate these techniques in a case study of the development of classifiers for toxic commenting in online communities.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","","","","","","","","CHI '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: New Orleans, LA, USA","","","","data science; annotator fingerprinting; Computational reflexivity; critical data studies; human-centered data science; human-centered machine learning; model positionality; position mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Additionally, we propose a hybrid attack that synthesizes the strengths of the aforementioned strategies, achieving an accuracy advantage of over 95% in most cases.

Hyperlinks are inserted by the authors to enrich the text and facilitate the navigation through the network. However, authors tend to insert only a fraction of the relevant hyperlinks, mainly because this is a time consuming task. In this paper we address an annotation, which we refer to as anchor prediction. Even though it is conceptually close to link prediction or entity linking, it is a different task that require developing a specific method to solve it. Given a source document and a target document, this task consists in automatically identifying anchors in the source document, i.e words or terms that should carry a hyperlink pointing towards the target document. We propose a contextualized relational topic model, CRTM, that models directed links between documents as a function of the local context of the anchor in the source document and the whole content of the target document. The model can be used to predict anchors in a source document, given the target document, without relying on a dictionary of previously seen mention or title, nor any external knowledge graph. Authors can benefit from CRTM, by letting it automatically suggest hyperlinks, given a new document and the set of target document to connect to. It can also benefit to readers, by dynamically inserting hyperlinks between the documents they’re reading. Experiments conducted on several Wikipedia corpora (in English, Italian and German) highlight the practical usefulness of anchor prediction and demonstrate the relevancy of our approach.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","1310–1318","","","","","","","WWW '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Lyon, France","","","","Topic modeling; Annotation; Anchor prediction; Document network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Doing maturity assessments can range from simple self-assessment questionnaires to full-blown assessment methods, such as those recommended by the ISO/IEC 15504 or the SEI CMMI. A main caveat of these assessments is the resources they encompass. In addition, many times the lack of automation renders benchmarks not possible.

Hence, there is an urgent need to provide the user with a privacy solution to support selective sharing of their usage data with different entities. In this paper, we propose an ontology-based user privacy management approach that will enable the user to release their data based on sensitivity and privacy factors, thus making an informed privacy decision on their usage data sharing. Green Button Initiative is a smart grid application that allows users to download and share their energy usage data with third parties.

The fundamental elements of spatial knowledge include spatial entities, their types and the spatial relations between them. Structuring the spatial knowledge contained within text as a geospatial knowledge graph, and disambiguating the spatial entities, significantly facilitates its reuse. The automatic extraction of geographic information from text also allows the creation or enrichment of gazetteers. We propose a baseline approach for nested spatial entity and binary spatial relation extraction from text, a new annotated French-language benchmark dataset on the maritime domain that can be used to train algorithms for both extraction tasks, and benchmark results for the two tasks carried out individually and end-to-end. Our approach involves applying the Princeton University Relation Extraction system (PURE), made for flat, generic entity extraction and generic binary relation extraction, to the extraction of nested, spatial entities and spatial binary relations. By extracting nested spatial entities and the spatial relations between them, we have more information to aid entity disambiguation. In our experiments we compare the performance of a pretrained monolingual French BERT language model with that of a pretrained multilingual BERT language model, and study the effect of including cross-sentence context. Our results reveal very similar results for both models, although the multilingual model performs slightly better in entity extraction, and the monolingual model has slightly better relation extraction and end-to-end performances. We observe that increasing the amount of cross-sentence context improves the results for entity extraction whereas it has the opposite effect on relation extraction.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","21–30","","","","","","","GeoHumanities '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamburg, Germany","","","","deep learning; neural network; language model; binary spatial relation; geographic information; maritime data; nested spatial entity; spatial knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With regular health screening, disease detection and subsequent medical attention can proceed with far lesser chance of missing the critical period. The projection of health related issues from health screening has been studied by using statistical analysis methods. However, the results generally fail to alert the subjects regarding the potential risks involved due to lack of certainty. The potential health issues derived from statistical analysis of health screening data and medical general guidelines can only be presented to the subjects with probability and lack of supportive hard evidence. The efficacy of health screening consequently fails to be realized. In order to confront the dilemma, we have developed an Intelligent Health Projection System (IHPS) for providing an evidential health status projection and a more motivated health plan to the subjects. This study focuses on modelling Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and associated factors as an example. Other cases can be analogously implemented. The IHPS adaptively provides the projection of potential risk of getting T2DM by exploring the similarity between the subject's health screening data and previous T2DM patients' cases. The main building blocks, the cases that serve as a knowledge base for IHPS are modelled using ontology technology. As the main functionality of IHPS, the T2DM projection uses the traces left by previous T2DM patients and works on top of case-based reasoning mechanism. The proposed IHPS aims to promote better self-health management by enhancing a subject's comprehension on risks revealed in health screening result. The cases retrieved can not only being used for risk projection of a subject but also serving as evidences for physicians to provide more accurate and convincing health advice.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","185–194","","","","","","","ICMHI '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tsukuba, Japan","","","","Ontology; Entropy; Case-based Reasoning; Analytic Hierarchy Process; Health Projection; Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A lexical-based learning model (LexLM) was developed to predict synonymy among Metathesaurus terms and largely outperforms a rule-based approach (RBA) that approximates the current construction process. However, the LexLM has the potential for being improved further because it only uses lexical information from the source vocabularies, while the RBA also takes advantage of contextual information. We investigate the role of multiple types of contextual information available to the UMLS editors, namely source synonymy (SS), source semantic group (SG), and source hierarchical relations (HR), for the UMLS vocabulary alignment (UVA) problem. In this paper, we develop multiple variants of context-enriched learning models (ConLMs) by adding to the LexLM the types of contextual information listed above. We represent these context types in context-enriched knowledge graphs (ConKGs) with four variants ConSS, ConSG, ConHR, and ConAll. We train these ConKG embeddings using seven KG embedding techniques. We create the ConLMs by concatenating the ConKG embedding vectors with the word embedding vectors from the LexLM. We evaluate the performance of the ConLMs using the UVA generalization test datasets with hundreds of millions of pairs. Our extensive experiments show a significant performance improvement from the ConLMs over the LexLM, namely +5.0% in precision (93.75%), +0.69% in recall (93.23%), +2.88% in F1 (93.49%) for the best ConLM. Our experiments also show that the ConAll variant including the three context types takes more time, but does not always perform better than other variants with a single context type. Finally, our experiments show that the pairs of terms with high lexical similarity benefit most from adding contextual information, namely +6.56% in precision (94.97%), +2.13% in recall (93.23%), +4.35% in F1 (94.09%) for the best ConLM. The pairs with lower degrees of lexical similarity also show performance improvement with +0.85% in F1 (96%) for low similarity and +1.31% in F1 (96.34%) for no similarity. These results demonstrate the importance of using contextual information in the UVA problem.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","1037–1046","","","","","","","WWW '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Lyon, France","","","","neural networks; scalability; knowledge graph embeddings.; supervised learning; UMLS Metathesaurus; vocabulary alignment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Audio Spectrogram Transformers are excellent at exploiting large datasets, creating powerful pre-trained models that surpass CNNs when fine-tuned on downstream tasks. However, current popular Audio Spectrogram Transformers are demanding in terms of computational complexity compared to CNNs. Recently, we have shown that, by employing Transformer-to-CNN Knowledge Distillation, efficient CNNs can catch up with and even outperform Transformers on large datasets. In this work, we extend this line of research and increase the capacity of efficient CNNs by introducing dynamic CNN blocks constructed of dynamic convolutions, a dynamic ReLU activation function, and Coordinate Attention. We show that these dynamic CNNs outperform traditional efficient CNNs, such as MobileNets, in terms of the performance–complexity trade-off at the task of audio tagging on the large-scale AudioSet. Our experiments further indicate that the proposed dynamic CNNs achieve competitive performance with Transformer-based models for end-to-end fine-tuning on downstream tasks while being much more computationally efficient.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","2227–2241","","","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to support the architect, a lot of tools for conformance checking are available that allow to formalize the architecture in order to perform an automated verification. Typically, the formalization uses a rigid, tool-specific architecture concept language that may strongly deviate from the project-specific architecture concept language. In addition, a high level of formal expertise is required in order to comprehend the created formalization. We present an approach that uses a controlled natural language for the formalization of architecture concepts. This language allows to flexibly express architecture rules directly with project-specific concepts. Consequently, the resulting formalization is easy to understand and might also be used as an architecture documentation at the same time. Nevertheless, the documentation can be automatically verified, since the approach is based on powerful means of the semantic web, i.e., ontologies and description logics. For the evaluation of the approach, we use the real-world software system TEAMMATES and show that architecture rules and concepts can be flexibly designed and checked for conformance in order to detect crucial architecture violations.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","","","","","","","","ECSA '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Madrid, Spain","","","","ontologies; description logics; architecture conformance checking; architecture documentation; architecture erosion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Retrieving equivalent questions faces dual challenges: inconsistent representation of theoretical constructs (i.e. concept/sub-concept) across studies as well as between question and response options, and the evolution of vocabulary and structure in longitudinal text. To address these challenges, our multi-disciplinary collaboration of computer scientists and survey specialists presents a new information retrieval (IR) task of identifying concept (e.g. Housing, Job, etc.) equivalence across question and response options to harmonise longitudinal population studies. This paper investigates multiple unsupervised approaches on a survey dataset spanning 1946-2020, including probabilistic models, linear probing of language models, and pre-trained neural networks specialised for IR. We show that IR-specialised neural models achieve the highest overall performance with other approaches performing comparably. Additionally, the re-ranking of the probabilistic model's results with neural models only introduces modest improvements of 0.07 at most in F1-score. Qualitative post-hoc evaluation by survey specialists shows that models generally have a low sensitivity to questions with high lexical overlap, particularly in cases where sub-concepts are mismatched. Altogether, our analysis serves to further research on harmonising longitudinal studies in social science.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","2946–2950","","","","","","","SIGIR '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Padua, Italy","","","","natural language processing; information retrieval; conceptual comparison; longitudinal study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Student activities produce spatial-temporal data, which records the daily life of students and contains the potential regulations of student behavior. The complexity of these data brings challenges for data collection and data analysis. The key to solve these problems is data fusion. In addition, ontology alignment is an important method for exploring the association between different ontology in different fields. It can solve the problem of data fusion in practice and maximize the value of data. At present, the research methods of ontology alignment are mostly mathematical similarity algorithms, and not considering the uncertainty of spatial-temporal data. Ontology is better way to deal with spatial-temporal data. In order to solve this problem effectively, this paper proposes a method based on spatial-temporal data association, which establishes fuzzy ontology and formulates a series of fuzzy rules for fuzzy reasoning, and mines the relationship between data; then it connects the different concepts between ontologies to realize the alignment of ontologies. Finally, the fuzzy ontology modeling and fuzzy reasoning are implemented and tested by using high education context.

However, their success greatly depends on how they are integrated into the extensive curricula of domains where learning occurs through guided practice. In this work, we investigate the impact of integrating video as a learning tool into the learning curricula of surgery. We created a pedagogical video on surgical hysterectomy through a model based on the Conceptual Fields theory (Vergnaud) and performed two rounds of interviews with seven medical residents, who watched the video freely during their residency in gynecology-obstetrics as they trained with experts. We find that videos can complement guided physical training, as they can provide the rationale behind expert action, something that is difficult to explicit during guided training. Still, their linear and static nature limits their integration as true adjuncts. We discuss our vision of moving towards interactive videos created with an ontological approach, developed in a workshop with four expert surgeons, which involves the ability to navigate through levels of information and layers of representations, so that experts can represent information to learners according to pedagogical models that complement their complex and extensive learning curricula.","2023-04","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","","","CSCW1","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","surgery; conceptual fields theory; guided practice; video-based learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding traffic situations requires a complex fusion of perceptual information with domain-specific and causal commonsense knowledge. Whereas prior work has provided benchmarks and methods for traffic monitoring, it remains unclear whether models can effectively align these information sources and reason in novel scenarios. To address this assessment gap, we devise three novel text-based tasks for situational reasoning in the traffic domain: i) BDD-QA, which evaluates the ability of Language Models (LMs) to perform situational decision-making, ii) TV-QA, which assesses LMs' abilities to reason about complex event causality, and iii) HDT-QA, which evaluates the ability of models to solve human driving exams. We adopt four knowledge-enhanced methods that have shown generalization capability across language reasoning tasks in prior work, based on natural language inference, commonsense knowledge-graph self-supervision, multi-QA joint training, and dense retrieval of domain information. We associate each method with a relevant knowledge source, including knowledge graphs, relevant benchmarks, and driving manuals. In extensive experiments, we benchmark various knowledge-aware methods against the three datasets, under zero-shot evaluation; we provide in-depth analyses of model performance on data partitions and examine model predictions categorically, to yield useful insights on traffic understanding, given different background knowledge and reasoning strategies.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:10","2025-09-10 14:12:10","","3262–3272","","","","","","","KDD '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Long Beach, CA, USA","","","","language models; question answering; traffic understanding; zero-shot evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The successes have generated much interest in artificial intelligence among researchers and members of the public. However, deep learning algorithms generally require very large labelled data sets to work well and large labelled data sets are not always readily available. In addition, most machine learning techniques, including deep learning, often perform well statistically but can fail miserably when, for example, data are deliberately perturbed in an adversarial attack. Another criticism of deep learning techniques is a relative lack of explainability. This paper proposes the use of intentional learning to simultaneously address these issues.

Next, we use constraint solving to automatically assign deployments to devices at once, given their specific contexts. The resulting solution is transformed back to the PSM as to proceed with software deployment accordingly.

A formal representation of robot-assisted surgery can provide surgeons with an overview of the main stages of surgical intervention and a detailed description of the different steps, including all the possible emergencies that may occur. Formalizing such kinds of interventions could also help to train new surgeons. However, literature does not consider formal representations and properties of robot-assisted surgery properly.The Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) is a standard language allowing to represent processes in a graphical and semi-formal way. In this paper, we propose to use BPMN for representing the processes and the guidelines underlying robot-assisted surgery, considering the explicit modeling of temporal and informational aspects: in detail, guidelines aim at providing surgeons with high-level recommendations based on the operational knowledge of expert users, delivering hints on how to execute exploration tasks.

Temporal ranking models consider the temporal expressions found in text (e.g., “in 2021” or “last year”) as time units, rather than as keywords, to define a temporal relevance and improve ranking. This article introduces a new class of ranking models called Temporal Metric Space Models (TMSM), based on a new domain for representing temporal information found in documents and queries, where each temporal expression is represented as a time interval. Furthermore, we introduce a new frequency-based baseline called Temporal BM25 (TBM25). We evaluate the effectiveness of each proposed metric against a purely textual baseline, as well as several variations of the metrics themselves, where we change the aggregate function, the time granularity and the combination weight. Our extensive experiments on five test collections show statistically significant improvements of TMSM and TBM25 over state-of-the-art temporal ranking models. Combining the temporal similarity scores with the text similarity scores always improves the results, when the combination weight is between 2% and 6% for the temporal scores. This is true also for test collections where only 5% of queries contain explicit temporal expressions.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","","","2","41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Temporal information retrieval; Temporal Metric Space; temporal ranking; texto-temporal relevance; time similarity; timexes","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose a novel framework called Trace BERT (T-BERT) to generate trace links between source code and natural language artifacts. To address data sparsity, we leverage a three-step training strategy to enable trace models to transfer knowledge from a closely related Software Engineering challenge, which has a rich dataset, to produce trace links with much higher accuracy than has previously been achieved. We then apply the T-BERT framework to recover links between issues and commits in Open Source Projects. We comparatively evaluated accuracy and efficiency of three BERT architectures. Results show that a Single-BERT architecture generated the most accurate links, while a Siamese-BERT architecture produced comparable results with significantly less execution time. Furthermore, by learning and transferring knowledge, all three models in the framework outperform classical IR trace models. On the three evaluated real-word OSS projects, the best T-BERT stably outperformed the VSM model with average improvements of 60.31% measured using Mean Average Precision (MAP). RNN severely underper-formed on these projects due to insufficient training data, while T-BERT overcame this problem by using pretrained language models and transfer learning.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","324–335","","","","","","","ICSE '21","","","","IEEE Press","Madrid, Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","deep learning; language models; Software traceability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the first stage a domain ontology is utilized to predict the sentiment. If the domain ontology stage is inconclusive, a back-up stage based on an SVM bag-of-words model is employed. Furthermore, the use of word embeddings to improve the domain ontology coverage in the first stage by finding semantically similar words is investigated. We find that the two-stage approach significantly outperforms two baseline methods and achieves competitive results for the SemEval-2016 data.

This can only work as a method of sharing and integrating knowledge beyond the spatial and temporal context of local projects, if the referred features or phenomena of reality are distinct and can diachronically be identified by independent observers in the same way and without a clarifying dialogue between them. In this article, we argue that only a smaller part of the features in our environment are sufficiently distinct over a useful time-span in order to form such “identifiable individuals”. Ontological categories should each provide specific criteria for the so-called ontological individuation, i.e., about how parts of reality can be subdivided into identifiable individuals that are useful for modelling their behaviour and interactions in reality for answering specific scientific questions, by obeying evidential constraints as a result of applying these criteria in observations. We motivate by several examples that there are always cases in which the individuality of such an instance may be undecidable basically within all such ontological categories and that all ontological categories are more or less effective approximations of reality. We argue that effective knowledge sharing by information systems using formal ontologies is only possible if these limitations of applicability and precision to real world phenomena are well understood and taken into account.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","","","2","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Information integration; Scientific realism; Epistemic Individuation; Historical Data; Historical Sciences; Ontological Individuation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this purpose, many research works have been interested in configurable process mining techniques to discover and configure processes from event logs. Moreover, to use the knowledge captured by event logs when mining processes, the concept of semantic process mining is introduced. It allows for combining semantic technologies with process mining. Despite the diversity of works in mining and customizing configurable process models, the application of these techniques is still limited to use semantics in minimizing the complexity of discovered processes. However, it seems to be pertinent to discover semantically enriched configurable process models directly from event logs. Consequently, this can facilitate using semantic in configuring, verifying conformance or enhancing discovered configurable processes. In this paper, we present a comparative study of existing works that focus on mining configurable process models with respect to semantic technologies. Our aim is to propose a new framework to automatically discover semantically enriched configurable processes.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","","","","","","","","SITA'20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Rabat, Morocco","","","","Ontology; Semantic Technologies; Variability; Configurable Process Model; Process Mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

One example of these educational initiatives is the effort of integrating aspects of engineering and technology with the existing core subjects of sciences and mathematic in K-12 education. These efforts are often labeled as STEM or STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Arts.) These subjects, studied in an integral form, are considered essential in the education of the citizens of a modern society. A common obstacle encountered in the implementation of these projects or initiatives is the lack of consensus on the specific topics to be included in the curriculum, the pedagogical methodology selected for the classroom, and the means, computer-based or otherwise, to be used by the teachers and the students. Often the lack of consensus among the different constituencies in charge of these projects finds its roots in the different assumptions made by their participants. This paper addresses one of the most acute set of differences present in these projects: the teaching methods used in class, knowing the resources and limitations of the human mind. In the last few decades we have learned much of how the mind works; what tasks are intrinsically easy or difficult for the human mind. Also, with the extensive access to computing power in our society, it is important to determine if a traditional task was studied in school for its practical use or for its value in developing the potential qualities of the mind. In this paper we will use the word computation in its traditional meaning of symbol manipulation. In that sense, all processes of thinking, solving problems, and endeavors of creation are processes of symbol manipulation, or computation. In this paper we present a computational model of the mind in order to provide a standard reference that will help in finding answers to questions such as: when is a task complex, what are the cognitive capabilities and limitations of the mind, what teaching methodologies are optimal, and why.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","41–45","","","","","","","ICEEL '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","Ontology; Computing; Complex Systems; Computational Theory of the Mind; Model of the Mind; New approaches to problem solving; STEM Education","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We generate time-series disaster graphs every minute using SNS data (e.g., Twitter) and public data, specifically focusing on disasters. Then, we create disaster knowledge graphs to represent the relationships between various data sources and try to predict their potential developments. We label and annotate knowledge graphs and then detect sudden changes in time-series disaster knowledge graphs for disaster detection. To that end, we assess the effectiveness of three state-of-the-art GNN models for graph-based event classification using Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), Graph Attention Network (GAT), and SageConv.

Our experiments show promising results with approximately 87% precision in detecting disaster events using structural data and connectivity patterns within disaster graphs. Finally, we measure the result of disaster detection time with an unseen dataset, showing positive results that about 70% detect a disaster in less than 3 minutes.

The evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been already considered as the primary strategy to develop an ontology alignment system. However, such systems have two significant drawbacks: they either need a ground truth that is often unavailable, or they utilize the population-based EAs in a way that they require massive computation and memory. This article presents a new ontology alignment system, called SANOM, which uses the well-known simulated annealing as the principal technique to find the mappings between two given ontologies while no ground truth is available. In contrast to population-based EAs, the simulated annealing need not generate populations, which makes it significantly swift and memory-efficient for the ontology alignment problem. This article models the ontology alignment problem as optimizing the fitness of a state whose optimum is obtained by using the simulated annealing. A complex fitness function is developed that takes advantage of various similarity metrics including string, linguistic, and structural similarities. A randomized warm initialization is specially tailored for the simulated annealing to expedite its convergence. The experiments illustrate that SANOM is competitive with the state-of-the-art and is significantly superior to other EA-based systems.","2019-05","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ontology alignment; OAEI; SANOM; simulated annealing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, the reasons for its runtime behaviour may be difficult to understand. In these cases, accountability is crucial, and decisions by the system need to be traceable. Logging is essential to support explanations of behaviour, but it poses challenges. Concerns about analysing massive logs have motivated the introduction of structured logging, however, knowing what to log and which details to include is still a challenge. Structured logs still do not necessarily relate events to each other, or indicate time intervals. We argue that logging changes to a runtime model in a provenance graph can mitigate some of these problems. The runtime model keeps only relevant details, therefore reducing the volume of the logs, while the provenance graph records causal connections between the changes and the activities performed by the agents in the system that have introduced them. In this paper, we demonstrate a first version towards a reusable infrastructure for the automated construction of such a provenance graph. We apply it to a multithreaded traffic simulation case study, with multiple concurrent agents managing different parts of the simulation. We show how the provenance graphs can support validating the system behaviour, and how a seeded fault is reflected in the provenance graphs.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","12–21","","","","","","","SAM '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Canada","","","","Provenance; self-explanation; multi-threading; runtime models; self-adaptation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The most challenging aspect of model management is to keep inter-related models consistent with each other while they evolve. As a consequence, there is a lot of scientific activity in this area, which has produced an extensive body of knowledge, methods, results and tools. The majority of these approaches, however, are limited to binary inter-model relations; i.e. the synchronisation of exactly two models. Yet, not every multi-ary relation can be factored into a family of binary relations. In this paper, we propose and investigate a novel comprehensive system construction, which is able to represent multi-ary relations among multiple models in an integrated manner and thus serves as a formal foundation for artefacts used in consistency management activities involving multiple models. The construction is based on the definition of partial commonalities among a set of models using the same language, which is used to denote the (local) models. The main theoretical results of this paper are proofs of the facts that comprehensive systems are an admissible environment for (i) applying formal means of consistency verification (diagrammatic predicate framework), (ii) performing algebraic graph transformation (weak adhesive HLR category), and (iii) that they generalise the underlying setting of graph diagrams and triple graph grammars.","2021-12","2025-09-10 14:12:11","2025-09-10 14:12:11","","1067–1114","","6","33","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Berlin, Heidelberg Publisher: Springer-Verlag","","","","Category theory; Adhesive categories; Consistency restoration; Consistency verification; Graph diagrams; Inter-model consistency; Model merging; Model synchronisation; Model weaving; Multi-directional transformations (MX); Multi-modelling; Triple graph grammars","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To obtain precise complexity results for unions of conjunctive queries, we transform the original problem in polynomial time into an intermediate problem that is easier to analyze: query answering for guarded disjunctive existential rules with stratified negation.

User feedback from ranked outputs forms a dynamic interaction loop with IR systems, which can be modeled as either one-time or sequential decision-making problems. Over the past decade, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as a promising approach to decision-making, leveraging the high model capacity of deep learning for complex tasks. While significant research has explored the application of DRL to IR tasks, several fundamental challenges remain underexplored, including the underlying information theory in DRL settings, the limitations of reinforcement learning methods for industrial IR applications, and the simulation of DRL-based IR systems. Concurrently, the advent of large language models (LLMs) has introduced new opportunities for optimizing and simulating IR systems. Building on the success of the Agent-based IR Workshop at SIGIR 2024, we propose hosting the second Agent-based IR Workshop at SIGIR 2025. This workshop will continue to provide a platform for researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present cutting-edge advances in DRL-based and LLM-based IR systems from an agent-based perspective. By building on the foundation laid in the first workshop, the 2025 edition aims to delve deeper into emerging research challenges, foster collaborations, and explore innovative applications.

Nevertheless, despite this essential link between content and references, Wikidata's ability to systematically assess and assure the quality of its references remains limited. To this end, we carry out a mixed-methods study to determine the relevance, ease of access, and authoritativeness of Wikidata references, at scale and in different languages, using online crowdsourcing, descriptive statistics, and machine learning. Building on previous work of ours, we run a series of microtasks experiments to evaluate a large corpus of references, sampled from Wikidata triples with labels in several languages. We use a consolidated, curated version of the crowdsourced assessments to train several machine learning models to scale up the analysis to the whole of Wikidata. The findings help us ascertain the quality of references in Wikidata and identify common challenges in defining and capturing the quality of user-generated multilingual structured data on the web.

Existing biomedical subgraph retrieval methods are tailored for graph neural networks (GNNs), limiting compatibility with other paradigms, including large language models (LLMs). We introduce K-Paths, a model-agnostic retrieval framework that extracts structured, diverse, and biologically meaningful multi-hop paths from dense biomedical KGs. These paths enable prediction of unobserved drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, including those involving entities not seen during training, thus supporting inductive reasoning. K-Paths is training-free and employs a diversity-aware adaptation of Yen's algorithm to extract the K shortest loopless paths between entities in a query, prioritizing biologically relevant and relationally diverse connections. These paths serve as concise, interpretable reasoning chains that can be directly integrated with LLMs or GNNs to improve generalization, accuracy, and enable explainable inference. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that K-Paths improves zero-shot reasoning across state-of-the-art LLMs. For instance, Tx-Gemma 27B improves by 19.8 and 4.0 F1 points on interaction severity prediction and drug repurposing tasks, respectively. Llama 70B achieves gains of 8.5 and 6.2 points on the same tasks. K-Paths also boosts the training efficiency of EmerGNN, a state-of-the-art GNN, by reducing the KG size by 90% while maintaining predictive performance.

This creates a federated data management problem that disperses information across many firms and regulators. We prototype an ontology for the Federal Reserve's public National Information Center (NIC) database. The NIC identifies all BHCs, their subsidiaries, and the ownership and control relationships among them. It is a basic official source on the structure of the industry. A formal ontology can capture this expert-curated knowledge in a coherent, structured format. This could assure data integrity and enable non-experts to more readily integrate and analyze data about complex organizations. We test the design and development of federated prototype ontologies in OWL/RDF to provide and integrate the NIC data with precise semantics for transparency and consistency.

This research builds on joint work from two countries, addressing concerns about AI's increasing influence in IT sector workplaces and its implications for tertiary education. The study focuses on AI technologies such as generative AI (GenAI) and large language models (LLMs). It examines how they are perceived and adopted and their effects on workplace dynamics, task allocation, and human-system interaction.IT professionals, noted as early adopters of AI, offer valuable insights into the interplay between AI and work engagement, highlighting the significant competencies required for digital workplaces. This study employs a dual-method approach, combining a systematic and multi-vocal literature review and qualitative research methods. These included a thematic analysis of a set of 47 interviews conducted between March and May of 2024 with IT professionals in two countries (New Zealand and Sweden). The research aimed to understand the implications for computing students, education curricula, and the assessment of emerging professional competencies.The literature review found insufficient evidence addressing comprehensive AI practice methodologies, highlighting the need to both develop and regulate professional competencies for effective AI integration. Key interview findings revealed diverse levels of GenAI adoption, ranging from individual experimentation to institutional integration. Participants generally expressed positive attitudes toward the technology and were actively pursuing self-learning despite some concerns. The themes emerging from the interviews included AI's role in augmenting human tasks, privacy and security concerns, productivity enhancements, legal and ethical challenges, and the evolving need for new competencies in the workplace.The study underscores the critical role of competency frameworks in guiding professional development and ensuring preparedness for an AI-driven environment.

In this paper we present a hybrid solution for sentence-level aspect-based sentiment analysis using A Lexicalised Domain Ontology and Neural Attention (ALDONA) model to handle the problems mentioned above. To measure the influence of each word in a given sentence on an aspect's polarity, we introduce the bidirectional context attention mechanism. Moreover, the classification module is designed to handle the sentence's complex structure. Finally, the manually created lexicalised domain ontology (represented in OWL) is integrated to exploit the field-specific knowledge.

At the same time, emotion psychology also proposed many appraisal theories for emotional evaluations and concrete predictions. While sentiment analysis focuses on identifying the polarity, appraisal theories of emotion can define different emotions and view emotions as process rather than states. In real life, the mechanism of emotional generations and interactions is complicated. Only plausible polarity can't provide enough explanations for the emotional mechanism. Hence an explainable model is in demand during emotion inference and dynamical analysis. In this paper, an analysis framework is constructed for interpreting casual association based on the emotional logic. Knowledge graph is introduced into the appraisal theories for inferring the emotions and predicting the action tendency. The emotion knowledge graph levels: concept level and case level. The concept level can be built manually as an abstract based on the appraisal model of Ortony, Clore &amp; Collins (OCC model). The inference and predictions can be implemented at this level. The case level includes entities, objects, events and cognitive relations between them that extract from the text through the modular functions. The elements in the case level can be linked to the abstract types in the concept level for the emotional inference. We test this emotional analysis framework on several datasets from the appraisal theory and the text of drama works.

There has been little to no research on extending the capabilities of NLIDB systems to handle complex business intelligence (BI) queries that often involve nesting as well as aggregation. In this paper, we present Athena++, an end-to-end system that can answer such complex queries in natural language by translating them into nested SQL queries. In particular, Athena++ combines linguistic patterns from NL queries with deep domain reasoning using ontologies to enable nested query detection and generation. We also introduce a new benchmark data set (FIBEN), which consists of 300 NL queries, corresponding to 237 distinct complex SQL queries on a database with 152 tables, conforming to an ontology derived from standard financial ontologies (FIBO and FRO). We conducted extensive experiments comparing Athena++ with two state-of-the-art NLIDB systems, using both FIBEN and the prominent Spider benchmark.

After that, protein-protein interaction networks were constructed using STRING and then Cytoscape was used to determine hub genes, significant modules, and their associated genes. Simultaneously, three ML-based techniques such as support vector machine (SVM), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-logistic regression (LASSO-LR), and partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) were implemented to determine the discriminative genes of HCC from common DEGs. Moreover, metadata of hub genes were formed by listing all hub genes from existing studies to incorporate other findings in our analysis. Finally, seven key candidate genes (ASPM, CCNB1, CDK1, DLGAP5, KIF20 A, MT1X, and TOP2A) were identified by intersecting common genes among hub genes, significant modules genes, discriminative genes from SVM, LASSO-LR, and PLS-DA, and meta hub genes from existing studies.

In order to produce efficient tools for both creation and enrichment of ontologies, the participation of the human in such a process still seems necessary. Our approach, that foresees a broader framework for ontology learning, is based by first on the automatic extraction of triples from heterogeneous sources, then on the presentation of the most reliable triples to the human operator for validation purposes. The system provides the user with a series of graphical representations that can give him an overview of the level of uncertainty of the automatically generated ontology.

The current state-of-the-art systems use many different approaches to match semantics, syntax, and terminologies of different ontological entities. However, most of the ontology alignment systems depend on domain knowledge, which makes the alignment process domain-specific. To address this challenge, we aim at developing an ontology alignment approach that is independent of domain knowledge. To achieve this goal, an ontology alignment approach is proposed which exploits an unsupervised learning method using a recursive neural network to align classes between different ontologies. In particular, the proposed approach extracts structural information of the classes in ontology to train the unsupervised model. The proposed approach is tested against a reference gold copy of the Anatomy data set in the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our evaluation results show that the proposed unsupervised neural network approach using the meta information of ontological classes yields satisfactory results with a precision of 95.66% and F-measure of 80.26% for a similarity threshold of 0.96 with the 100-dimension input vector. Increasing the input vector dimension to 300 results in improved precision of 97.71% and F-measure of 80.38% with a 0.96 threshold. The significance of the proposed approach is that it can be used for ontology alignment independent of domain expertise and without the need for human intervention.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","1874–1882","","","","","","","SAC '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Republic of Korea","","","","LSTM; unsupervised learning; ontology schema alignment; ontology schema matching; recursive neural network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the evaluation of ontology-mediated queries (OMQs) over relational databases is computationally hard. This raises the question when OMQ evaluation is efficient, in the sense of being tractable in combined complexity or fixed-parameter tractable. We study this question for a range of ontology-mediated query languages based on several important and widely-used DLs, using unions of conjunctive queries as the actual queries. For the DL ELHI⊥, we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that are fixed-parameter tractable. For its fragment ELHdr⊥, which restricts the use of inverse roles, we provide a characterization of the classes of OMQs that are tractable in combined complexity. Both results are in terms of equivalence to OMQs of bounded tree width and rest on a reasonable assumption from parameterized complexity theory. They are similar in spirit to Grohe's seminal characterization of the tractable classes of conjunctive queries over relational databases. We further study the complexity of the meta problem of deciding whether a given OMQ is equivalent to an OMQ of bounded tree width, providing several completeness results that range from NP to 2ExpTime, depending on the DL used. We also consider the DL-Lite family of DLs, including members that, unlike ELHI⊥, admit functional roles.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","LICS '19","","","","IEEE Press","Vancouver, Canada","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ICTIR went through a number of major developments in 2025 that are briefly described below.A new chapter in the history of ICTIR: Ten years ago, ICTIR 2015 was established under the ACM SIGIR umbrella as the premier forum for presenting and discussing research on theoretical and foundational aspects of Information Retrieval. Given the evolving nature of the Information Retrieval field and the needs of the SIGIR community and the conference, ACM ICTIR, formerly known as the ""ACM SIGIR International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval"", is renamed to ACM SIGIR International Conference on Innovative Concepts and Theories in Information Retrieval.This new branding highlights and clarifies the focus of the conference for the authors, the reviewers, and the organizers. The conference aims to provide a forum for the presentation and discussion of research related to the foundational aspects of Information Retrieval (IR), including, for example, new or improved models of relevance, ranking, representation, information needs, and evaluation. The conference also welcomes interdisciplinary research that connects information retrieval with other research disciplines that are theoretically motivated. We use the definition of foundation used by ICTIR founders as a scientific result that others can build upon and use for their own research. While IR research traditionally relies heavily on rigorous experimentation, ICTIR does not see this as a must.SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit for ICTIR: For the first time, ICTIR 2025 accepts two types of submissions: regular submissions and SIGIR Revise-and-Resubmit (SIGIR-RR) submissions. SIGIRRR submissions are for revised manuscripts of papers that were submitted to but not accepted by the SIGIR 2025 conference (only full and short paper tracks). Authors can use this option to address the issues raised in the SIGIR 2025 reviews and revise the paper accordingly.Special Theme: Even though ICTIR 2025 welcomes papers on all areas of Information Retrieval as detailed above, its program especially welcomes research papers related to the following theme: ""LLMs + IR, what could possibly go wrong?"" This theme stands on the long-term relationship between large language models and information retrieval. In order to foster a lively discussion on this theme, we seek innovative and foundational technical research papers and discussion papers that methodologically studies this theme by providing impactful perspectives, opinions, or positions on the matter.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We iteratively design a system where AI agents play different roles and simulate human design activity through conversational turns. The agents investigate user needs, identify design constraints, and explore the design space, with useful insights emerging from their interactions. To assess reasoning quality, we conducted a human jury evaluation with five HCI researchers and explored potential applications through a contextual inquiry with seven professionals. Our findings demonstrate that integrating human design thinking techniques enhances AI reasoning. AI agents effectively tackle design problems, generating low-novelty yet well-grounded and practical solutions that meet key design requirements.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","CUI '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Generative AI; End-user interaction with LLMs and Multimodal models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Customer reviews, which commented by people who bought the very product, now have been one of the most important resources for analyzing product's quality risk. We can get fine-gained, aspect-oriented risk information of a product by mining its reviews. Unfortunately, people tend to write reviews with casual grammar or just omit parts of components of a sentence. Both these features will cause negative impacts when parsing the raw customer reviews directly. Thus a knowledge base which is built totally beyond the reviews could be used to analyze it despite the drawbacks above. In this paper, we generate a domain ontology from raw text in the online encyclopedia. It can be viewed as a graph whose nodes represent domain concepts and edges represent the relations between these concepts. In our work, we integrate syntactic tree structure in linear-chain CRFs for recognizing domain concepts and train SVMs and MaxEnt models on elaborate features for clarifying three types of relationship, namely ""Attribute-of"", ""Part-of"" and ""Instance-of"".

Among these models, the UML class diagram occupies a privileged place in object-oriented systems because it not only serves as a basis for communication between developers but also provides a closely aligned static representation of the system implementation. However, creating a UML class diagram from a textual system specification poses a significant challenge due to the inherent imprecision and ambiguity commonly found in natural language expressions.

In the context of multimedia big data this issue is stressed due to the intrinsic complexity nature of this kind of data. Moreover, the relations among objects should be clearly expressed and formalized to give the right meaning of data correlation. For this reason the design of formal models to represent and manage information is a necessary task to implement intelligent information systems. In this latter some approaches related to the semantic web could be used to improve the data models which underlie the implementation of big data applications. Using these models the visualization of data and information become an intrinsic and strategic task for the analysis and exploration of multimedia BigData. In this paper we propose the use of a semantic approach to formalize the model structure of multimedia BigData. In addition, the recognition of multimodal features to represent concepts and linguistic properties to relate them are an effective way to bridge the gap between the target semantic classes and the available low-level multimedia descriptors. The proposed model has been implemented in a NoSQL graph database populated from different knowledge sources and a visualization of this very large knowledge base has been presented and discussed as a case study.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","31–38","","","","","","","MEDES '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tokyo, Japan","","","","semantics; multimedia ontologies; semantic bigdata","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Accurate trial outcome prediction based on historical trial data promises better trial investment decisions and more trial success. Existing trial outcome prediction models were not designed to model the relations among similar trials, capture the progression of features and designs of similar trials, or address the skewness of trial data which causes inferior performance for less common trials.To fill the gap and provide accurate trial outcome prediction, we propose Sequential Predictive mOdeling of clinical Trial outcome (SPOT) that first identifies trial topics to cluster the multisourced trial data into relevant trial topics. It then generates trial embeddings and organizes them by topic and time to create clinical trial sequences. With the consideration of each trial sequence as a task, it uses a meta-learning strategy to achieve a point where the model can rapidly adapt to new tasks with minimal updates. In particular, the topic discovery module enables a deeper understanding of the underlying structure of the data, while sequential learning captures the evolution of trial designs and outcomes. This results in predictions that are not only more accurate but also more interpretable, taking into account the temporal patterns and unique characteristics of each trial topic. We demonstrate that SPOT wins over the prior methods by a significant margin on trial outcome benchmark data: with a 21.5% lift on phase I, an 8.9% lift on phase II, and a 5.5% lift on phase III trials in the metric of the area under precision-recall curve (PR-AUC).

Unfortunately, these models suffer from the vocabulary mismatch problem, which may block re-ranking stages from relevant documents at the very beginning. Therefore, it has been a long-term desire to build semantic models for the first-stage retrieval that can achieve high recall efficiently. Recently, we have witnessed an explosive growth of research interests on the first-stage semantic retrieval models. We believe it is the right time to survey current status, learn from existing methods, and gain some insights for future development.

Building such semantic representations of domain concepts requires knowledge about the specific domain. Such a thorough knowledge can be obtained through the contextual information available in raw text documents on those domains.

The proposed model not only considers the contextual BERT embeddings but also incorporates a TF-IDF vectorizer that gives a word level importance to the model. The performance of the model has been evaluated against several baseline architectures.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","311–315","","","","","","","WWW '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ljubljana, Slovenia","","","","Ontology; Transformers; Text Classification; Automatic Classification of Financial Term; TFIDF Vectors","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The traditional teaching and learning materials, which are usually organized topically and security-centric, have fewer linkages with learners' experience and prior knowledge that they bring to the learning sessions. Learners often do not associate vulnerabilities or coding practices with programs similar to what they were writing in their previous time. Consequently, their motivation for learning is not touched by conventional methods. The aim of this paper is the presentation of an ontology-based learning system for software security with contextualized learning approaches, and of the results of an initial evaluation using a controlled quasi-experiment in a university learning environment. This system facilitates the contextual learning process by providing contextualized access to security knowledge via real software application scenarios, in which learners can explore and relate the security knowledge to the context they are already familiar with. The experiment results show that the prototyped system with the proposed learning approach not only yields significant knowledge gain compared to the conventional learning approach but also gains better learning satisfaction of students.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","90–99","","","","","","","EASE '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Copenhagen, Denmark","","","","ontology; Software security; context-based knowledge; learning system","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The query language SPARQL has become the standard language for querying RDF since its W3C standardization in 2008. However, the 2008 version of this language missed some important functionalities: reasoning capabilities to deal with RDFS and OWL vocabularies, navigational capabilities to exploit the graph structure of RDF data, and a general form of recursion much needed to express some natural queries. To overcome these limitations, a new version of SPARQL, called SPARQL 1.1, was released in 2013, which includes entailment regimes for RDFS and OWL vocabularies, and a mechanism to express navigation patterns through regular expressions. Unfortunately, there are a number of useful navigation patterns that cannot be expressed in SPARQL 1.1, and the language lacks a general mechanism to express recursive queries. To the best of our knowledge, no efficient RDF query language that combines the above functionalities is known. It is the aim of this work to fill this gap. To this end, we focus on a core fragment of the OWL 2 QL profile of OWL 2 and show that every SPARQL query enriched with the above features can be naturally translated into a query expressed in a language that is based on an extension of Datalog, which allows for value invention and stratified negation. However, the query evaluation problem for this language is highly intractable, which is not surprising since it is expressive enough to encode some inherently hard queries. We identify a natural fragment of it, and we show it to be tractable and powerful enough to define SPARQL queries enhanced with the desired functionalities.","2018-11","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","3","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Semantic web; SPARQL; RDF; query answering; Datalog-based languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An IoT network such as a smart surveillance system combines the working of Closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and various sensors to perform real-time computation for identifying threats and critical situations with the help of valuable context information. This information is perceptual in nature and needs to be converted into higher-level abstractions that can further be used for reasoning to recognize situations. Semantic abstractions for perceptual inputs are possible with the use of a multimedia ontology encoded using Multimedia Web Ontology Language (MOWL) that helps to define concepts, properties and structure of a possible environment. MOWL also allows for a dynamic modeling of real-time situations by employing Dynamic Bayesian networks (DBN), which suits the requirements of a intelligent IoT system. In this paper, we show the application of this framework in a smart surveillance system. Surveillance is enhanced by not only helping to analyze past events, but by predicting dangerous situations for which preventive actions can be taken. In our proposed approach, continuous video stream of data captured by CCTV cameras can be processed on the fly to give real-time alerts to concerned authorities. These alerts can be disseminated using e-mail, text messaging, on-screen alerts and alarms.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","SCA '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tetouan, Morocco","","","","Internet of Things (IoT); Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN); Multimedia ontology; Smart Surveillance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an official framework for processing biographical history-related messages on the semantic web, including biographical events, time and space relationships, related personal messages, and more. We elaborate on this ontology knowledge architecture and explain how to use BKOnto as a basis for more domain-specific knowledge representation. In BKOnto, we use the OWL language to define the main components of the cognitive structure of the historical body of biography, namely the Storyline of the biography and the historical event of the biography. The so-called biographical story line, which is used to organize the history of multiple biographical superstructure, can be used to describe the biography of a particular person. The so-called biographical historical events, based on the historical data can be based on the description of the content and related space-time factor description of the basic unit. BKOnto's design was based on the StoryLine and Event infrastructure, and then we developed the ontology knowledge building system based on this ontology awareness architecture. Therefore, we also developed a set of ontology knowledge building system based on BKOnto, which is called StoryTeller. The StoryTeller system can be used to construct relevant knowledge of human things in the history of the biography and form a complete biographical story. StoryTeller system, mainly based on the story line organized by the timeline, which contains a number of types and events related to multiple human things as the basic unit to build the story line. The event unit not only describes the description of related human affairs, but also contains the description of time factor and space factor, which is used to construct the space-time information of the unit in the story line. As a result, in a story line with multiple event units, you will be able to present a wealth of information about people and things with their associated spatiotemporal features. In addition, based on the idea of supporting the digital collection system, we also linked up individual event units with the digital collection system of their information sources so that more diverse digital collections could be presented in the future. The empirical study also uses the Mackay Digital Archives Project (http://dlm.csie.au.edu.tw/) as a source of information to demonstrate the ontology knowledge building process of Mackay's biographical stories, as well as related Digital collection of information.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","33–38","","","","","","","ICIIT '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Ha Noi, Viet Nam","","","","ontology; OWL; semantic web; Biographical knowledge; ontology composition system; temporal event","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Owing to the lack of video knowledge graph dataset, the work which integrates video understanding and KG is rare. In this paper, we propose a heterogeneous dataset that contains the multi-modal video entity and fruitful common sense relations. This dataset also provides multiple novel video inference tasks like the Video-Relation-Tag (VRT) and Video-Relation-Video (VRV) tasks. Furthermore, based on this dataset, we propose an end-to-end model that jointly optimizes the video understanding objective with knowledge graph embedding, which can not only better inject factual knowledge into video understanding but also generate effective multi-modal entity embedding for KG. Comprehensive experiments indicate that combining video understanding embedding with factual knowledge benefits the content-based video retrieval performance. Moreover, it also helps the model generate better knowledge graph embedding which outperforms traditional KGE-based methods on VRT and VRV tasks with at least 42.36% and 17.73% improvement in HITS@10.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","95–104","","","","","","","ICMR '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Thessaloniki, Greece","","","","knowledge graph; multi-modal learning; video inference; video understanding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The widely used practice is to build task-specific or even dataset-specific solutions, which are hard to generalize and disable the opportunities of knowledge sharing that can be learned from different datasets and multiple tasks. In this paper, we propose Unicorn, a unified model for generally supporting common data matching tasks. Unicorn can enable knowledge sharing by learning from multiple tasks and multiple datasets, and can also support zero-shot prediction for new tasks with zero labeled matching/non-matching pairs. However, building such a unified model is challenging due to heterogeneous formats of input data elements and various matching semantics of multiple tasks. To address the challenges, Unicorn employs one generic Encoder that converts any pair of data elements (a, b) into a learned representation, and uses a Matcher, which is a binary classifier, to decide whether a matches b. To align matching semantics of multiple tasks, Unicorn adopts a mixture-of-experts model that enhances the learned representation into a better representation. We conduct extensive experiments using 20 datasets on seven well-studied data matching tasks, and find that our unified model can achieve better performance on most tasks and on average, compared with the state-of-the-art specific models trained for ad-hoc tasks and datasets separately. Moreover, Unicorn can also well serve new matching tasks with zero-shot learning.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","data integration; multi-task learning; data matching","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Clinicians have long used algorithmic thinking to describe and implement prescriptions but without the benefit of a formal programming language. Instead, medical algorithms are expressed using a natural language patois, flowcharts, or as structured data in an electronic medical record system. The lack of a prescription programming language inhibits expressiveness; results in prescriptions that are difficult to understand, hard to debug, and awkward to reuse; and increases the risk of fatal medical error.This article reports on the design and evaluation of Patient-Oriented Prescription Programming Language (POP-PL), a domain-specific programming language designed for expressing prescriptions. The language is based around the idea that programs and humans have complementary strengths that, when combined properly, can make for safer, more accurate performance of prescriptions. Use of POP-PL facilitates automation of certain low-level vigilance tasks, freeing up human cognition for abstract thinking, compassion, and human communication.We implemented this language and evaluated its design attempting to write prescriptions in the new language and evaluated its usability by assessing whether clinicians can understand and modify prescriptions written in the language. We found that some medical prescriptions can be expressed in a formal domain-specific programming language, and we determined that medical professionals can understand and correctly modify programs written in POP-PL. We also discuss opportunities for refining and further developing POP-PL.","2018-07","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","DSL design; empirical evaluation; medical prescriptions; medical programming languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this issue, we propose an efficient representation for short text based on concepts instead of terms, which transforms the data representation into a shorter, more compact, and more predictive one. However, for the Arabic language, the majority of semantic resources are incomplete projects; this may presents a serious problem about the coverage ratio of the Arabic language compared with other Languages. To overcome this problem and starting with the assumption that terms belonging to same topic share many semantic links in the same dataset, their corresponding concepts will share the same semantics links in the same dataset.

Models are built using a modelling language whose syntax is defined by a metamodel. Hence, objects in models are typed by a metamodel class, and this typing relation is static as it is established at creation time and cannot be changed later. This way, objects in MDE are closed and fixed with respect to the type they conform to, the slots/properties they have, and the constraints they should obey. This hampers the reuse of model-related artefacts like model transformations, as well as the opportunistic or dynamic combination of metamodels. To alleviate this rigidity, we propose making model objects open so that they can acquire or drop so-called facets, each one contributing a type, slots and constraints to the object. Facets are defined by regular metamodels, hence being a lightweight extension of standard metamodelling. Facet metamodels may declare usage interfaces, and it is possible to specify laws that govern how facets are to be assigned to the instances of a metamodel.

To accommodate these variations and to make the assessment explicit and interpretable, we present a quality model-based approach for measuring aesthetics that defines a quality function in terms of the formula of the measures, their weights, their composition, and their overall computation. This quality model is transformed into a configuration used by GRACE, a web application developed for this purpose. When the measures, their formula, their weights, or the quality function change, the quality model changes, which is re-computed to compare it with any other model, thus making the measurement process explicit and interpretable.

Link keys are crucial for EM, serving as rules allowing to identify identity links across different KGs, possibly described using different ontologies. However, the approach for extracting link keys struggles to scale on large KGs. While embedding-based EM methods efficiently handle large KGs they lack explainability. This paper proposes a novel hybrid EM approach to guarantee the scalability link key extraction approach and improve the explainability of embedding-based EM methods. First, embedding-based EM approaches are used to sample the KGs based on the identity links they generate, thereby reducing the search space to relevant sub-graphs for link key extraction. Second, rules (in the form of link keys) are extracted to explain the generation of identity links by the embedding-based methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach allows link key extraction to scale on large KGs, preserving the quality of the extracted link keys. Additionally, it shows that link keys can improve the explainability of the identity links generated by embedding-methods, allowing for the regeneration of 77% of the identity links produced for a specific EM task, thereby providing an approximation of the reasons behind their generation.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","3344–3353","","","","","","","WWW '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sydney NSW, Australia","","","","knowledge graphs; language models; entity matching; embedding-based em; graph embeddings; hybrid ai; link keys; symbolic em","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a BERT-based method (BERT-ConvE), to exploit transfer learning of BERT in combination with a convolutional network model ConvE. Comparing to existing text-aware approaches, we effectively make use of the context dependency of BERT embeddings through optimizing the features extraction strategies.

Gene Ontology (GO), a taxonomy of biological terms to represent the properties of gene products and their relations, has been widely used for this purpose. We utilize GO to introduce a new set of specificity measures: Relative Depth Specificity (RDS), Relative Node-based Specificity (RNS), and Relative Edge-based Specificity (RES), leading to a new family of similarity measures. We use these similarity measures to obtain a confidence score for each PPI. We evaluate the new measures using four different benchmarks. We show that all the three measures are quite effective.

Furthermore, we examine techniques to enhance profile accuracy through combining multiple browsing data sources, distinguishing important concepts from irrelevant ones in a user profile, and the concept levels required from a reference ontology to describe user's interests.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","NISS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Marrakech, Morocco","","","","Ontology; User profile; Accuracy; Personalized Search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, a perfectly accurate transcript still can be challenging to read due to grammatical errors, disfluency, and other noises common in spoken communication. These readable issues introduced by speakers and ASR systems will impair the performance of downstream tasks and the understanding of human readers. In this work, we present a task called ASR post-processing for readability (APR) and formulate it as a sequence-to-sequence text generation problem. The APR task aims to transform the noisy ASR output into a readable text for humans and downstream tasks while maintaining the semantic meaning of speakers. We further study the APR task from the benchmark dataset, evaluation metrics, and baseline models: First, to address the lack of task-specific data, we propose a method to construct a dataset for the APR task by using the data collected for grammatical error correction. Second, we utilize metrics adapted or borrowed from similar tasks to evaluate model performance on the APR task. Lastly, we use several typical or adapted pre-trained models as the baseline models for the APR task. Furthermore, we fine-tune the baseline models on the constructed dataset and compare their performance with a traditional pipeline method in terms of proposed evaluation metrics. Experimental results show that all the fine-tuned baseline models perform better than the traditional pipeline method, and our adapted RoBERTa model outperforms the pipeline method by 4.95 and 6.63 BLEU points on two test sets, respectively. The human evaluation and case study further reveal the ability of the proposed model to improve the readability of ASR transcripts.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Automatic speech recognition; data synthesis; post-processing for readability; pre-trained model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing modelling tools only serve one of these two extreme purposes: either to create informal drawings or diagrams, or to build models fully conformant to their modelling language. This lack of reconciliation is hampering the adoption of model-based techniques in practice, as they are deemed too imprecise in the former case, and too rigid in the latter.In this new ideas paper, we claim that modelling tools need further flexibility covering different stages, purposes and approaches to modelling.

These systems are known as self-adaptive and autonomous systems (SAS). Some of these decisions can have a life-changing impact on the people involved and therefore, they need to be appropriately tracked and justified: the system should not be taken as a black box. It is required to be able to have knowledge about past events and records of history of the decision making. However, tracking everything that was going on in the system at the time a decision was made may be unfeasible, due to resource constraints and complexity. In this paper, we propose an approach that combines the abstraction and reasoning support offered by models used at runtime with provenance graphs that capture the key decisions made by a system through its execution. Provenance graphs relate the entities, actors and activities that take place in the system over time, allowing for tracing the reasons why the system reached its current state. We introduce activity scopes, which highlight the high-level activities taking place for each decision, and reduce the cost of instrumenting a system to automatically produce provenance graphs of these decisions. We demonstrate a proof of concept implementation of our proposal across two case studies, and present a roadmap towards a reusable provenance layer based on the experiments.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","","","","","","","","MODELS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Canada","","","","provenance; self-explanation; runtime models; autonomous decision-making; PROV-DM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rise of the word vector space, improving ontology using word embedding has become a hot spot. Most of previous studies have focused on how to acquire different ontological elements using all kinds of learning technologies. Few studies focus on the prior knowledge in a given ontology. In essence, ontology learning or improving is still a learning process based on existing samples. So, the type and number of knowledge acquired is limited by existing samples in a given ontology. This paper firstly formalizes several kinds of prior knowledge for classes in a given ontology. Then we propose a method, named improving medical ontology based on word embeddings (IMO-WE), to enrich different types of knowledge from medical text according to characteristics of different types of prior knowledge. At last, the paper collects the PubMed Central (PMC) data and the PHARE ontology, and finishes a series of experiments to evaluate the IMO-WE. The experimental results yield the following conclusions. The first one is that the data-rich model can achieve higher accuracy for the IMO-WE under same setting in training progress. So, collecting and training big medical data is a viable way to learn more useful knowledge. The second one is that the IMO-WE can be used to improving ontology knowledge when medical data is sufficiently abundant and the ontology has appropriate prior knowledge. Moreover, in the task of improving synonymous labels through similarity distance, the accuracy of IMO-WE is significantly better than that of the Random indexing method.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:12","2025-09-10 14:12:12","","121–127","","","","","","","ICBCB 2018","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Chengdu, China","","","","word embedding; medical ontology improving; prior knowledge","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We show that DL-LiteA , which is well-known for enjoying first-order rewritability of query answering, enjoys a first-order rewritability property also for instance-level update. That is, every update can be reformulated into a set of insertion and deletion instructions computable through a non-recursive Datalog program with negation.

In particular, we simulate a user’s search intent by building two profiles: A positive user profile for the probabilities of the user is interested in the topics and a corresponding negative user profile for the probabilities of being not interested in the the topics. The profiles are estimated based on the user’s search logs. A clicked webpage is assumed to include interesting topics. A skipped (viewed but not clicked) webpage is assumed to cover some non-interesting topics to the user. Such estimations are performed in the latent topic space generated by LDA. Moreover, a new approach is proposed to estimate the correlation between a given query and the user’s search history so as to determine how much personalization should be considered for the query. We compare our proposed models with several strong baselines including state-of-the-art personalization approaches. Experiments conducted on a large-scale real user search log collection illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed models.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","","","3","40","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Personalization; Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA); probabilistic model; topic-graph; Web search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a core component, dialogue state tracking (DST) plays a key role in task-oriented dialogue systems, and its function is to parse natural language dialogues into dialogue state formed by slot-value pairs. It is well known that dialogue state tracking has been well studied and explored on current benchmark datasets such as the MultiWOZ. However, almost all current research completely ignores the user negative feedback utterances that exist in real-life conversations when a system error occurs, which often contains user-provided corrective information for the system error. Obviously, user negative feedback utterances can be used to correct the inevitable errors in automatic speech recognition and model generalization. Thus, in this paper, we will explore the role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking in detail through simulated negative feedback utterances. Specifically, due to the lack of dataset involving negative feedback utterances, first, we have to define the schema of user negative feedback utterances and propose a joint modeling method for feedback utterance generation and filtering. Then, we explore three aspects of interaction mechanism that should be considered in real-life conversations involving negative feedback utterances and propose evaluation metrics related to negative feedback utterances. Finally, on WOZ2.0 and MultiWOZ2.1 datasets, by constructing simulated negative feedback utterances in training and testing, we not only verify the important role of negative feedback utterances in dialogue state tracking, but also analyze the advantages and disadvantages of different interaction mechanisms involving negative feedback utterances, lighting future research on negative feedback utterances.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","2222–2232","","","","","","","KDD '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Washington DC, USA","","","","dialogue state tracking; negative feedback; real-life dialogue","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although this representation is concise, problems exist on lack of semantic elements and single semantic relationship, which is not conducive to the representation of procedural knowledge and hinders the teaching and application of procedural knowledge.

Combining with the cognitive background of procedural knowledge and introducing event cognition, the representation method of procedural knowledge graph and the construction process model are obtained. The verification proves that the event graph is a procedural knowledge representation method with complete semantic roles and rich semantic relations.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","85–91","","","","","","","ICETT '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Macau, China","","","","Knowledge Representation; Procedural knowledge; Event Graph; Knowledge Model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The emergence of this phenomenon has led to a rapid increase in the incidence of mental illness. In order to deal with this phenomenon, this paper proposes a system of question and answering on the basic knowledge of mental health (MHQ&amp;A) by using deep learning retrieval technology and knowledge graph technology. The system MHQ&amp;A is designed mainly for the general public, to answer the basic knowledge of mental health, especially the field of depression. First of all, the basic and the professional question and answer data about mental health were respectively obtained by the reptilian bot from the ""IASK"" website knowledge and the ""Dr. Dingxiang"" website. Then, the questions and answers obtained through the crawler are made into a Question and Answering Knowledge Graph of Basic Health Knowledge in the mental health field, which is combined with semantic data of antidepressants and the semantic data of depression papers. Finally, a set of template matching rules is designed to determine the type of problem of users. If the questions are about the professional knowledge of medicine or thesis, the reasoning template will be used to reason and search the answer in the ""Question and Answering Knowledge Graph of Basic Health Knowledge in the Mental Health Field"". If the questions are about other basic knowledge in the field of mental health, the BERT model is used to vectorize the questions of users, and the matching questions and corresponding answers in the MHQ&amp;A are found through cosine similarity calculation.

This paper states the thesis that when learning agents are applied to work environments that require domain-specific experience, the agent benefits if it can be further adapted by a supervising domain expert. Closely interacting with the agent, a domain expert should be able to understand its decisions and update the underlying knowledge base as needed.The result would be an agent with individualized knowledge that comes in part from the domain experts. The model of such an adaptive learning agent must take into account the problem domain, the design of the learning agent and the perception of the domain user. Therefore, already in the modeling phase, more attention must be paid to make the learning element of the agent adaptable by an operator. Domain modeling and meta-modeling methods could help to make inner processes of the agent more accessible. In addition, the knowledge gained should be made reusable for future agents in similar environments.To begin with, the existing methods for modeling agent systems and the underlying concepts will be evaluated, based on the requirements for different industrial scenarios. The methods are then compiled into a framework that allows for the description and modeling of such systems in terms of adaptability to a problem domain. Where necessary, new methods or tools will be introduced to close the gap between inconsistent modeling artifacts.The framework shall then be used to build learning agents for real-life scenarios and observe their application in a case study.

The integration of heterogeneous data from sensors can be achieved by data mining algorithms able to build correlations. Nevertheless, the meaning and the value of these correlations is difficult to perceive without highlighting the meaning of the data and the semantic description of the measured environment.In order to bridge this gap and build causality relationships form heterogeneous sensor data, we propose an ontology-based approach, that consists in exploring heterogeneous sensor data (light, temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc) in terms of ontologies enriched with semantic meta-data describing the life cycle of the monitored environment.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","","","","","","","","IOT '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Santa Barbara, California, USA","","","","ontologies; IoT; event ontology; big data; semantic sensor data; smart viticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traversing the dependency graph is realized using breadth-first search along with a mechanism that tracks tabu test cases, i.e., test cases to be ignored for further evaluation due to faulty parent test cases. As a result, the number of evaluated test cases is minimized, thus reducing the time required for validating the ontology after each modification. We conducted an empirical evaluation to determine the efficiency of our approach.

To address this issue, we created Co-ML – a tablet-based app for learners to collaboratively build ML image classifiers through an end-to-end, iterative model-building process.

Existing ontology matching approaches include machine learning. In particular, recent works leverage weak supervision (WS) through programmatic labeling to avoid the intensive hand-labeling for large ontologies. Programmatic labeling relies on heuristics and rules, called Labeling Functions (LFs), that generate noisy and incomplete labels. However, to cover a reasonable portion of the dataset, programmatic labeling might require a significant number of LFs that might be time expensive and not always straightforward to program.This paper proposes a novel system, namely OntoAugment, that augments LF labels for the ontology matching problem, starting from outcomes of the LFs. Our solution leverages the ""similarity of similarities"" between ontology concept bipairs that are two pairs of concepts.

However, a remaining challenging problem in NL2SQL is the inherent ambiguity in the natural language questions asked by users. In this paper, we introduce Sphinteract, a framework designed to assist LLMs in generating high-quality SQL answers that accurately reflect the user intent. Our key insight to resolve ambiguity is to take into account minimal user feedback interactively. We introduce the Summarize, Review, Ask (SRA) paradigm, which guides LLMs in identifying ambiguities in NL2SQL tasks and generates targeted questions for the user to answer. We propose three different methods of how to process user feedback and generate SQL queries based on user input.

It can serve as a key module of the healthcare copilot, helping reduce misdiagnosis for healthcare practitioners and patients. However, the diagnostic accuracy and specificity of existing heuristic-based RAG models used in the medical domain are inadequate, particularly for diseases with similar manifestations. This paper proposes MedRAG, a RAG model enhanced by knowledge graph (KG)-elicited reasoning for the medical domain that retrieves diagnosis and treatment recommendations based on manifestations. MedRAG systematically constructs a comprehensive four-tier hierarchical diagnostic KG encompassing critical diagnostic differences of various diseases. These differences are dynamically integrated with similar EHRs retrieved from an EHR database, and reasoned within a large language model. This process enables more accurate and specific decision support, while also proactively providing follow-up questions to enhance personalized medical decision-making. MedRAG is evaluated on both a public dataset DDXPlus and a private chronic pain diagnostic dataset (CPDD) collected from Tan Tock Seng Hospital, and its performance is compared against various existing RAG methods. Experimental results show that, leveraging the information integration and relational abilities of the KG, our MedRAG provides more specific diagnostic insights and outperforms state-of-the-art models in reducing misdiagnosis rates.

In addition, Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is considered today to be a widely adopted platform, related to environmental monitoring and decision making applications. Specifically, exclusive subjects, such as environmental degradation and optimized agriculture, provide a scope of applied research on the basis of multilevel semantic data analysis. Observations and sensors are the core of empirical science and their implementation (i.e., the increasing volume of data, heterogeneity of devices, data formats and measurement procedures) produce a large volume of unsupervised data. Thus, the prevailing growth of sensing systems has currently led to the development of defined interoperability among standards on web semantics. In particular, Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) ontologies prospect on modeling the capabilities and properties of sensors, monitoring procedures and observations.

At this end, we propose daily life patients Sentiment Analysis model based on hybrid embedding vocabulary for related-medication text under distributed dependency, and concepts translation methodology by incorporating medical knowledge from social media and real life medical science systems.

Through mining of large patient datasets, it is possible to identify opportunities for intervention and to determine the effectiveness of treatment. There are currently many methods to analyze and learn causal relationships in large patient datasets, as well as specific causal studies in epidemiology that define specific relationships among symptoms and treatments. This paper introduces a novel methodology to utilize causal knowledge to extend and improve a standard hierarchical medical ontology. First, we will obtain the hierarchical structure of the patient symptom variables based on the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities Terminology (MedDRA). Then, we will learn a Causal Bayesian Network (CBN) using Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC), a hybrid constraint and score-based learning algorithm, on the pre-existing National Institutes of Mental Health (NIMH) study on Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression (STAR*D) patient dataset. Finally, we will use the causal links discovered in the CBN to evolve the ontology and its hierarchy.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","954–957","","","","","","","ASONAM '18","","","","IEEE Press","Barcelona, Spain","","","","","","","","","","","","ontology; data mining; healthcare data; data management; patient data; ontology evolution; causal inference; causal networks; causality; healthcare information technology; bayesian networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, current KGC models are still limited by the following two aspects. (1) the entity semantics is implicitly learned by neural network and merely depends on existing facts, which mostly suffers from less additional specific knowledge. Although previous studies have noticed that entity type information can effectively improve KGC task, most of them rely on labeled type-specific data. (2) the recent graph-based models mainly concentrate on Graph Neural Network (GNN) to update source entity representation, regardless of the separate role that neighborhood information plays and may mix noisy neighbor features for target prediction. To address the above two issues, we propose a neighborhood re-ranking model with relation constraint for KGC task. We suggest that both relation constraint and structured information located in triples can boost the model performance. More importantly, we automatically generate explicit constraints as additional type feature to enrich entity representation instead of depending on human annotated labels. Meanwhile, we construct a neighborhood completion module to re-rank candidate entities for full use of the neighbor structure rather than traditional GNN updating manner. Extensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves the competitive results in comparison to the recent advanced baselines.","2022-11","2025-09-10 14:12:13","2025-09-10 14:12:13","","411–425","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This, together with the emergence of domain-specific theory, is often taken as an indicator of the maturity of any research area. This article explores the development and subsequent usage of domain-specific theories and theoretical constructs (TCs) in computing education research (CER). All TCs found in 878 papers published in three major CER publication venues over the period 2005–2020 were identified and assessed to determine the nature and purpose of the constructs found. We focused more closely on areas related to learning, studying, and progression, where our analysis found 80 new TCs that had been developed, based on multiple epistemological perspectives. Several existing frameworks were used to categorize the areas of CER focus in which TCs were found, the methodology by which they were developed, and the nature and purpose of the TCs. A citation analysis was undertaken, with 1,727 citing papers accessed to determine to what extent and in what ways TCs had been used and developed to inform subsequent work, also considering whether these aspects vary according to different focus areas within computing education. We noted which TCs were used most often and least often, and we present several brief case studies that demonstrate progressive development of domain-specific theory. The exploration provides insights into trends in theory development and suggests areas in which further work might be called for. Our findings indicate a general interest in the development of TCs during the period studied, and we show examples of how different approaches to theory development have been used. We present a framework suggesting how strategies for developing new TCs in CER might be structured and discuss the nature of theory development in relation to the field of CER.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","theory; literature; Computing education; instrument; research; theoretical construct","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similar to user-centered design which is based on user profiles, RaCA features reader-centered writing through reader profiles that are dynamically computed from information discovered through academic search engines. Our assistant then leverages large language models to measure the congruence of a written text with a given reader profile, and provides feedback to the writer.

Dynamically adapting the size of a fact-check report is thus an important functionality for systems designed to convey claim verification explainability. Recent works have experimented with applying transformers-based or LLM-based text summarization methods in a zero-shot or few-shot manner, making use of some existing texts available in the summary parts of fact-check reports (e.g., called ""justification” in PolitiFact). However, for complex fact-checks, the purely sub-symbolic summarizers tend to either omit some elements of the fact-checker's argumentation chains or include contextual statements that may not be essential at the given level of granularity. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhancing fact-check summarization with the aim of injecting elements of structured fact-checker argumentation. This argumentation is, in turn, not only captured at the discourse level but tied to an entity graph representing the fact-check, for which we employ the PURO diagrammatic language. We have empirically performed a manual analysis of fact-check reports from two fact-checker websites, yielding (1) textual snippets containing the argumentation essence of the fact-check report and (2) categorized argumentation elements tied to entity graphs. These snippets are then fed to a state-of-the-art hybrid summarizer which has previously produced accurate fact-check summaries, as an additional input. We observe mild improvements on various ROUGE metrics, even if the validity of the results is limited given the small size of the dataset. We also compare the human-provided argumentation element categories with those returned, for the given fact-check ground truth summary, using a pre-trained language model upon both basic and augmented prompting. This yields a moderate accuracy as the model often fails to comply with the explicit given instructions.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","1473–1481","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","text summarization; argumentation; entity graph; fact-checking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel RAG approach that leverages a substring extraction tool from retrieved documents to minimise hallucinations.

While a variety of machine learning approaches have been considered for text classification over SRS documents, many of these fail to provide adequate performance as they often ignore the meaning of software artifacts or integrate domain knowledge for the classification task. Recent advances in deep learning methodology have significantly contributed to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and text classification. One of the main challenges in using deep learning models for various NLP tasks in the software engineering domain is the scarcity of labeled textual data. In addition, even with sufficient data, training from the scratch still requires significant training time and computational resources. Transfer learning is a novel approach that proposes a solution to such reservations by providing pre-trained models that enable fine-tuning with the customized data. In this research, we conduct an empirical analysis on multi-class text classification over SRS documents using different pre-trained transformer models including BERT, DistilBERT, Roberta, AlBERT, and XLNet, and compare their performance. We test the performance of these models using three SRS datasets: DOORS, NFR-PROMISE, and PURE.

Early research on empathetic response generation often focused on directly capturing the emotional state of the context using fixed emotion labels. However, the logical aspects exhibited in human conversations heavily rely on experiential and knowledge-based resources within the brain. This implies that whether the aim is to acquire more nuanced emotional states or to generate responses enriched with comprehensive information, the incorporation of external knowledge as supplementary information in empathetic dialogue systems is imperative. In response to this challenge, we propose a novel approach for extracting external knowledge. This is achieved by designing two components: a fine-grained knowledge graph constructed using the context and an external knowledge base, and coarse-grained knowledge acquisition based on COMET. These two scales of knowledge are then integrated with the context using methods like context refinement.

The main contribution of the study is the application of topic modeling to build a knowledge model that, in turn, allows for an automated labeling process to train classifiers. Given a collection of unlabeled tourism online reviews, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is applied to automatically label each document. Each topic discovered by LDA is labeled with one specific category, representing its semantic meaning based on an existing general ontology as a reference. These automatically labeled documents are used for classification, and the result is compared with manual annotation. Experiments on Indonesian tourism datasets showed that the automatic labeling approach using LDA provides for a precision score of 70%.

The SHApes Constraint Language (SHACL) allows for expressing certain types of quality constraints that define sub-structures and correct values in KGs modelled with RDF. Nevertheless, performing SHACL validation without entailment often yields onesided outcomes, as it falls short of validating crucial implicit data encoded in the KG ontology. Current solutions that incorporate entailment into SHACL validation are inefficient, due to the time-intensive process of applying inference rules to the entire dataset. Moreover, applying entailment for SHACL validation can generate large amounts of redundant triples, exacerbating the validation workload and resulting in erroneous or redundant validation results. In light of these challenges, we propose Re-SHACL, an approach that combines targeted reasoning and entity merging techniques to generate a concise, consolidated RDF graph devoid of redundancy. Re-SHACL significantly reduces execution time and improves the accuracy of the validation reports. Our experiments demonstrate that Re-SHACL can be combined with state-of-the-art validators to deliver accurate validation reports efficiently.","2024-07","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","3589–3601","","11","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For example, eCommerce sales have grown from around 5% of total US sales in 2012 to around 15.4% in year 2023. This rapid growth of eCommerce has created new challenges and vital new requirements for intelligent information retrieval systems. Which lead to the primary motivations of this workshop:(1) Since the pandemic hit, eCommerce became an important part of people's routine and they started using online shop- ping for smallest grocery items to big electronics as well as cars. With such a large assortment of products and millions of users, achieving higher scalability without losing accuracy is a leading concern for information retrieval systems for eCommerce.(2) The diverse buyers make the relevance of the results highly subjective, because relevance varies for different buyers. The most suitable and intuitive solution to this problem is to make the system interactive and provide correct relevance for different users. Hence, interactive information retrieval systems are becoming necessity in eCommerce.(3) To handle sudden change in buyers' behavior, industries adopted existing sub-optimal information retrieval techniques for various eCommerce tasks. Parallelly, they also started exploring/researching for better solutions and in dire need of help from research community.This workshop will provide a forum to discuss and learn the latest trends for interactive and scalable information retrieval approaches for eCommerce. It will provide academic and industrial researchers a platform to present their latest works, share research ideas, present and discuss various challenges, and identify the areas where further research is needed. It will foster the development of a strong research community focused on solving eCommerce-related information retrieval problems that provide superior eCommerce experience to all users.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","1208–1209","","","","","","","WSDM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Merida, Mexico","","","","information retrieval; recommender systems; interactive systems; ecommerce search; large language models (llms) in ecommerce; natural language processing (nlp) for ecommerce; ranking models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose an integrated digital-twin framework in which machine learning and semantic models collaboratively represent and reason with diverse patient data and medical domain knowledge to generate treatment recommendations. Clinical and molecular characteristics are used to discover subtypes of brain cancers, which are represented as ontologies with associated rules to determine a patient’s membership in a given subtype. Similarly, preclinical models used for therapeutic testing are characterized and assessed for their similarity to patient cancer models. By semantically discovering links between these preclinical models and patient cancer subtypes, novel therapeutics tested on preclinical models can be prioritized and hypothesized for individual patients. This approach, which requires empirical testing, demonstrates how cross-domain reasoning can be used to propose individualized treatment plans.","2025-06","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Ontologies; Machine Learning; Digital Twins; Semantic Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As such, complex specifications are built from incrementally composed fragments. In a cooperative specification, different fragments are contributed by different agents, usually capturing requirements on different facets of the system. For example, legal regulators and system administrators cooperate to specify the behaviour of a data exchange system. In practice, cooperative specification is difficult, as different contributors' requirements are difficult to elicit, express, and compose. In this work, we characterise cooperative specification and adopt an approach that leverages language features specifically introduced for controlling specification composition. In our approach, specifications model the domain as usual, but also specify how specifications may change. For example, a legal regulator defines 'consent to process data' and specifies which agents may consent, and which relaxations of the requirement are permitted. We propose and demonstrate generic language extensions that improve composition control in three case study languages: Datalog, Alloy, and eFLINT. We reflect on how these extensions improve composition control, and afford new data exchange scenarios. Finally, we relate our contributions to existing works, and to the greater vision of multi-agent data exchange to the satisfaction of their shared, complex, dynamic requirements.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","2–15","","","","","","","SLE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pasadena, CA, USA","","","","Data Exchange; Meta-Programming; Program Composition; Program Refinement; Specification Languages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The enterprise edition offers customizable Role-based Access Control features through custom developed procedures, while the community edition does not offer any access control support. Being a graph database, Neo4j appears to be a natural application for Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC), an access control paradigm where authorization decisions are based on relationships between subjects and resources in the system (i.e., an authorization graph). In this article, we present AReBAC, an attribute-supporting ReBAC model for Neo4j that provides finer-grained access control by operating over resources instead of procedures. AReBAC&nbsp;employs Nano-Cypher, a declarative policy language based on Neo4j’s Cypher query language, the result of which allows us to weave database queries with access control policies and evaluate both simultaneously. Evaluating the combined query and policy produces a result that (i) matches the search criteria, and (ii) the requesting subject is authorized to access. AReBAC&nbsp;is accompanied by the algorithms and their implementation required for the realization of the presented ideas, including GP-Eval, a query evaluation algorithm. We also introduce Live-End Backjumping (LBJ), a backtracking scheme that provides a significant performance boost over conflict-directed backjumping for evaluating queries. As demonstrated in our previous work, the original version of GP-Eval already performs significantly faster than the Neo4j’s Cypher evaluation engine. The optimized version of GP-Eval, which employs LBJ, further improves the performance significantly, thereby demonstrating the capabilities of the technique.","2020-07","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Neo4j; graph database; attributes; graph patterns; live-end backjumping; nano-cypher; Relationship-based access control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Importantly, SHACL allows to define recursive shapes, i.e. a shape may refer to itself, directly of indirectly. The recommendation left open the semantics of recursive shapes, but proposals have emerged recently to extend the official semantics to support recursion. These proposals are based on the principle of possibility (or non-contradiction): a graph is considered valid against a schema if one can assign shapes to nodes in such a way that all constraints are satisfied. This semantics is not constructive, as it does not provide guidelines about how to obtain such an assignment, and it may lead to unfounded assignments, where the only reason to assign a shape to a node is that it allows validating the graph. In contrast, we propose in this paper a stricter, more constructive semantics for SHACL, based on stable models, which are well-known in Answer Set Programming (ASP). This semantics additionally requires a shape assignment to be properly justified by the input constraints. We further exploit the connection to logic programming, and show that SHACL constraints can be naturally represented as logic programs, and that the validation problem for a graph and a SHACL schema can be encoded as an ASP reasoning task. The proposed semantics also enjoys computationally tractable validation in the presence of constraints with stratified negation (as opposed to the previous semantics). We also extend our semantics to 3-valued stable models, which yields a more relaxed notion of validation, tolerant to certain faults in the schema or data. By exploiting a connection between 3-valued stable model semantics and the well-founded semantics for logic programs, we can use our translation into ASP to show another tractability result. Finally, we provide a preliminary evaluation of the approach, which leverages an ASP solver to perform graph validation.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","1570–1580","","","","","","","WWW '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Taipei, Taiwan","","","","SHACL; answer set programming; graph-structured data","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we are proposing a framework for story classification (SC) using keyword and part-of-speech (POS) features. For improving the performance of SC system, feature reduction techniques and combinations of various POS tags are explored. Further, we investigated the performance of SC by dividing the story into parts depending on its semantic structure. In this work, stories are (i) manually divided into parts based on their semantics as introduction, main, and climax; and (ii) automatically divided into equal parts based on number of sentences in a story as initial, middle, and end. We have also examined sentence increment model, which aims at determining an optimum number of sentences required to identify story genre by incremental selection of sentences in a story. Experiments are conducted on Hindi and Telugu story corpora consisting of 300 and 150 short stories, respectively. The performance of SC system is evaluated using different combinations of keyword and POS-based features, with three well-established machine learning classifiers: (i) Naive Bayes (NB), (ii) k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), and (iii) Support Vector Machine (SVM). Performance of the classifier is evaluated using 10-fold cross-validation and effectiveness of classifier is measured using precision, recall, and F-measure. From the classification results, it is observed that adding linguistic information boosts the performance of story classification. In view of the structure of the story, main, and initial parts of the story have shown comparatively better performance. The results from the sentence incremental model have indicated that the first nine and seven sentences in Hindi and Telugu stories, respectively, are sufficient for better classification of stories. In most of the studies, SVM models outperformed the other models in classification accuracy.","2019-11","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","","","2","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","support vector machines; K-nearest neighbour; keyword features; latent semantic analysis; linear discriminant analysis; linguistic features; naive Bayes; sparse representation; story classification; text-to-speech; vector space model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most cost estimation models use the set of requirements for the product as the starting point. Function-point, COCOMO and use case-based cost estimation models belong to this category. These models assume that the requirements of the product are fairly rigid. However, with the advent of agile-based software development methods, the requirements keep changing during the development process. Therefore, traditional cost estimation models need to be refined to accommodate changes in requirements. The refinements should reflect the changes in cost when the requirements change. In this paper, we describe a cost estimation model for projects that use scrum, a popular agile method. The model uses the requirements of the new software product, written in the form of user stories, as the primary source. The cost is adjusted every time the requirements are changed or new requirements are introduced. We have also developed a project tracking tool for scrum projects in which this model has been implemented. The model was applied to academic projects developed by graduate students; the results indicate that estimations are fairly reasonable.","2022-11","2025-09-10 14:12:14","2025-09-10 14:12:14","","30–37","","4","38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Evansville, IN, USA Publisher: Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For this task, we make use of the explicit, expert-provided knowledge on dance movements and their relations to the musical beat. Due to the complexity of this knowledge, the MEBNs were used as the probabilistic ontological framework in which the knowledge is formalized. The reason we opt for MEBNs for this task is that they combine Bayesian and formal (first-order) logic into a single model. In this way, the Bayesian probabilistic part of MEBNs was used to capture, using example data and training, the implicit part of the expert knowledge about dances, i.e., this part of the knowledge that cannot be formalized and explicitly defined accurately enough, while the logical maintains the explicit knowledge representation in the same way ontologies do. Moreover, we present in detail the MEBN models we built for Tsamiko and Salsa, using expert-provided explicit knowledge.

Several metrics have been proposed for describing mulitilinguality at the level of a whole knowledge graph. Albeit enabling the understanding of the ecosystem of knowledge graphs in terms of the utilized languages, they are unable to capture a fine-grained description of the languages in which the different entities and properties of the knowledge graph are represented. This lack of representation prevents the comparison of existing knowledge graphs in order to decide which are the most appropriate for a multilingual application.In this work, we approach the problem of ranking knowledge graphs based on their language features and propose LINGVO, a framework able to capture mulitilinguality at different levels of granularity. Grounded in knowledge graph descriptions, LINGVO is, additionally, able to solve the problem of ranking knowledge graphs according to a degree of mulitilinguality of the represented entities. We have empirically studied the effectiveness of LINGVO in a benchmark of queries to be executed against existing knowledge graphs. The observed results provide evidence that LINGVO captures the mulitilinguality of the studied knowledge graphs similarly than a crowd-sourced gold standard.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","21–28","","","","","","","K-CAP '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Marina Del Rey, CA, USA","","","","knowledge graph; question answering; multilinguality; ranking","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While modeling and presenting interactive 3D scenes in collaborative VR/AR environments, different 3D objects are added, modified and removed by different users, which leads to the evolution of the scenes over time. Representation of VR content covering temporal knowledge is essential to enable exploration of such time-dependent VR/AR content. However, the available approaches do not enable exploration of VR content with regards to its time-dependent components and properties, which limits their usage in web-based systems. The main contribution of this paper is 4–dimensional representation of VR content, which encompasses time being the fourth dimension. The representation is based on the semantic web standards and ontologies, which enable the use of domain knowledge for collaborative creation and exploration of content. This could improve the availability of VR/AR applications to domain specialists without expertise in 3D graphics and animation, thus improving the overall dissemination of VR/AR on the web. The representation has been implemented in a heterogeneous collaborative VR environment for urban design.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","","","","","","","","Web3D '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Poznań, Poland","","","","ontologies; semantic web; 3D content; collaborative design; web 3D/VR/AR","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the one hand, the classification knowledge in diagnostic codes and drug codes is encoded by Graph Attention Network and fused into the clinical data for expanding the data content. On the other hand, a large number of single visit data of EMR are used to create the pre-trained visit model by a modified BERT for expanding the data scale.

Many attempts and efforts have been done to provide computing solutions to support the language. Developing Arabic chatbots is still an evolving research field and requires extra efforts due to the nature of the language. One of the common tasks of any natural language processing application is the stemming step. It is important for developing chatbots, since it helps with pre-processing the input data and it can be involved with different phases of the chatbot development process. The aim of this article is to combine a scoring approach with Arabic stemming techniques for developing an Arabic chatbot conversation engine. Two experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed solution. The first experiment is to select which stemmer is more accurate when applying our solution, since our algorithm can support various stemmers. The second experiment was conducted to evaluate our proposed approach against various machine learning models. The results show that the ISRIS stemming algorithm is the best fit for our solution with accuracy 78.06%. The results also indicate that our novel solution achieved an F1 score of 65.5%, while the other machine learning models achieved slightly lower scores. Our study presents a novel technique by combining scoring mechanisms with stemming processes to produce the best answer for every query sent by chatbots users compared to other approaches. This can be helpful for developing Arabic chatbot and can support many domains such as education, business, and health. This technique is among the first techniques that developed purposefully to serve the development of Arabic chatbots conversation engine.","2022-01","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","","","4","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural language processing; machine learning; chatbot; Arabic language; stemming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the research methodology, we use PyThaiNLP to tokenize and remove stopwords and split datasets into 85% of the training set and 15% of the testing set. Next, we classify sentiment using machine learning and deep learning approaches with feature extraction such as bag-of-words, term frequency–inverse document frequency, and word embedding (Word2Vec and Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)) in given texts. The results show that support vector machine with the BERT model yields the best performance at 83.38%; in contrast, the random forest classifier with bag-of-words yields the worst performance at 54.10% in the machine learning approach. Another experiment reveals that long short-term memory with the BERT model yields the best performance at 84.07% in contrast to the convolutional neural network with bag-of-words, which yields the worst performance at 69.80% in the deep learning approach. The results imply that support vector machine, convolutional neural network, and long short-term memory are suitable for classifying sentiment in complex structure language.

This model doesn't require any additional parameter and can adapt the effect of different densities to edges. Extensive experiments on four test datasets for WordNet and SNOMED-CT demonstrate that the proposed edge weight model can significantly improve the accuracy of various edge-based similarity measures and has a wide coverage over different ontologies.

Intelligence analysis is an example of a domain that can benefit tremendously from narrative construction techniques, particularly in aiding analysts during the largely manual and costly process of synthesizing event information into comprehensive intelligence reports. Manual intelligence report generation is often prone to challenges such as integrating dynamic event information, writing fine-grained queries, and closing information gaps. This motivates the development of a system that retrieves and represents critical aspects of events in a form that aids in automatic generation of intelligence reports.We introduce a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to augment prompting of an autoregressive decoder by retrieving structured information asserted in a knowledge graph to generate targeted information based on a narrative plot model. We apply our approach to the problem of neural intelligence report generation and introduce FABULA, framework to augment intelligence analysis workflows using RAG. An analyst can use FABULA to query an Event Plot Graph (EPG) to retrieve relevant event plot points, which can be used to augment prompting of a Large Language Model (LLM) during intelligence report generation.

By treating a classification model's predictions for a given image as a set of labels analogous to a ""bag of words"", we rank the biases that a model has learned with respect to different identity labels. We use man, woman as a concrete example of an identity label set (although this set need not be binary), and present rankings for the labels that are most biased towards one identity or the other.

To reduce the high levels of attrition throughout the process, there has been a growing interest in applying machine learning methodologies to various stages of drug discovery and development in the recent decade, especially at the earliest stage – identification of druggable disease genes. In this paper, we have developed a new tensor factorisation model to predict potential drug targets (genes or proteins) for treating diseases. We created a three-dimensional data tensor consisting of 1,048 gene targets, 860 diseases and 230,011 evidence attributes and clinical outcomes connecting them, using data extracted from the Open Targets and PharmaProjects databases. We enriched the data with gene target representations learned from a drug discovery-oriented knowledge graph and applied our proposed method to predict the clinical outcomes for unseen gene target and disease pairs. We designed three evaluation strategies to measure the prediction performance and benchmarked several commonly used machine learning classifiers together with Bayesian matrix and tensor factorisation methods. The result shows that incorporating knowledge graph embeddings significantly improves the prediction accuracy and that training tensor factorisation alongside a dense neural network outperforms all other baselines. In summary, our framework combines two actively studied machine learning approaches to disease target identification, namely tensor factorisation and knowledge graph representation learning, which could be a promising avenue for further exploration in data-driven drug discovery.","2022-08","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","3070–3080","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Washington, DC, USA Publisher: IEEE Computer Society Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such a model may be used as the basis for predictions and corrective actions. The idea is to create, via an iterative process, a model that explains causal relationships in the form of structural and temporal patterns in the data. The first phase is the data-driven process of hypothesis formation, requiring the analysis of large amounts of data to find strong candidate hypotheses. The second phase is hypothesis testing, wherein a domain expert’s knowledge and judgment is used to test and modify the candidate hypotheses.The book is intended as a primer on Event Mining for data-enthusiasts and information professionals interested in employing these event-based data analysis techniques in diverse applications. The reader is introduced to frameworks for temporal knowledge representation and reasoning, as well as temporal data mining and pattern discovery. Also discussed are the design principles of event mining systems. The approach is reified by the presentation of an event mining system called EventMiner, a computational framework for building explanatory models. The book contains case studies of using EventMiner in asthma risk management and an architecture for the objective self. The text can be used by researchers interested in harnessing the value of heterogeneous big data for designing explanatory event-based models in diverse application areas such as healthcare, biological data analytics, predictive maintenance of systems, computer networks, and business intelligence.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","","","","35","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nursing notes documented by caregivers contain valuable information concerning a patient's state, which can aid in the development of intelligent clinical prediction systems. Moreover, due to the limited adaptation of structured electronic health records in developing countries, the need for disease prediction from such clinical text has garnered substantial interest from the research community. The availability of large, publicly available databases such as MIMIC-III, and advancements in machine and deep learning models with high predictive capabilities have further facilitated research in this direction. In this work, we model the latent knowledge embedded in the unstructured clinical nursing notes, to address the clinical task of disease prediction as a multi-label classification of ICD-9 code groups. We present EnTAGS, which facilitates aggregation of the data in the clinical nursing notes of a patient, by modeling them independent of one another. To handle the sparsity and high dimensionality of clinical nursing notes effectively, our proposed EnTAGS is built on the topics extracted using Non-negative matrix factorization. Furthermore, we explore the applicability of deep learning models for the clinical task of disease prediction, and assess the reliability of the proposed models using standard evaluation metrics. Our experimental evaluation revealed that the proposed approach consistently exceeded the state-of-the-art prediction model by 1.87% in accuracy, 12.68% in AUPRC, and 11.64% in MCC score.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:15","2025-09-10 14:12:15","","152–160","","","","","","","CoDS COMAD 2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hyderabad, India","","","","Deep Learning; Multi-label Classification; Natural Language Processing; Clinical Decision Support Systems; Disease Prediction; Healthcare Analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To demonstrate our methodology, we construct a sample of 6,800 job postings stratified by 68 major occupational groups, extract structured information on educational requirements, remote-work flexibility, full-time availability, and benefits, and show how these job characteristics vary across occupations. As a validation, we compare frequencies of educational requirements by occupation from our sample to survey data and find no statistically significant difference. Finally, we discuss the scalability to collections of millions of job postings. Our results establish the feasibility of measuring labor market trends at scale from online job postings thanks to advances in generative AI techniques.

We present a reusable dialogue-based approach to user interaction for active learning in activity recognition systems, which utilises semantic similarity measures and a dataset of natural language descriptions of common activities (which we make publicly available). Our approach involves system-initiated dialogue, including follow-up questions to reduce ambiguity in user responses where appropriate. We apply this approach to two active learning scenarios: (i) using an existing CASAS dataset, demonstrating long-term usage; and (ii) using an online activity recognition system, which tackles the issue of online segmentation and labelling. We demonstrate our work in context, in which a natural language interface provides knowledge that can help interpret other multi-modal sensor data.

To achieve this, we have developed a suite of heterogeneous operators capable of processing data across various modalities.

In this research, we introduce a novel protein function prediction method HMMeta, which is based on the prominent natural language prediction technique Hidden Markov Models (HMM). With a new representation of protein sequence as a language, we trained a unique HMM for each Gene Ontology (GO) term taken from the UniProt database, which in total has 27,451 unique GO IDs leading to the creation of 27,451 Hidden Markov Models. We employed data augmentation to artificially inflate the number of protein sequences associated with GO terms that have a limited amount in the database, and this helped to balance the number of protein sequences associated with each GO term. Predictions are made by running the sequence against each model created. The models within eighty percent of the top scoring model, or 75 models with the highest scores, whichever is less, represent the functions that are most associated with the given sequence. We benchmarked our method in the latest Critical Assessment of protein Function Annotation (CAFA 4) experiment as CaoLab2, and we also evaluated HMMeta against several other protein function prediction methods against a subset of the UniProt database. HMMeta achieved favorable results as a sequence-based method, and outperforms a few notable methods in some categories through our evaluation, which shows great potential for automated protein function prediction.

Creating knowledge schemas for newly emerging, unfamiliar, domain-specific ideas or events poses the following challenges: (i) detecting relevant, often previously unknown concepts associated with the new domain; and (ii) learning ontological, semantically accurate relationships among the new concepts, despite having severely limited annotated data. To this end, we propose a novel LSTM-based framework with attentive pooling, BOLT-K, to learn an ontology for a target subject or domain. We bootstrap our ontology learning approach by adapting and transferring knowledge from an existing, functionally related source domain. We also augment the inadequate labeled data available for the target domain with various strategies to minimize human expertise during model development and training. BOLT-K first employs semantic and graphical features to recognize the entity or concept pairs likely to be related to each other, and filters out spurious concept combinations. It is then jointly trained on knowledge from the target and source domains to learn relationships among the target concepts. The target concepts and their corresponding relationships are subsequently used to construct an ontology. We extensively evaluate our framework on several, real-world bio-medical and commercial product domain ontologies. We obtain significant improvements of 5-25% F1-score points over state-of-the-art baselines. We also examine the potential of BOLT-K in detecting the presence of novel kinds of relationships that were unseen during training.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","1897–1908","","","","","","","WWW '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, CA, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The FrameWeb method is a model-driven approach that targets the development of systems that use certain kinds of frameworks in their architecture, proposing the use of models that incorporate concepts from these frameworks during design. Currently, the FrameWeb method does not consider SPA (Single Page Application) frameworks and, in recent years, they have gained a lot of popularity among developers. In this work, we propose to add support for SPA frameworks to FrameWeb. With our research, we have managed to update the FrameWeb meta-model so that its modeling language now supports SPA frameworks and their constructs.

Experiments of modeling existing SPAs with this new version of FrameWeb, generating code from the models and comparing with the original, showed that, in average, around 69% of the HTML tags could be generated from the models.

We review bunch theory in the context of expression languages including non-recursive functions, and show how giving bunches set semantics suggests that evaluating bunch functions amounts to computing with relations.

In order to quantitatively analyze the trend of students' thinking and behavior, an estimation model of students' thinking and behavior trend based on big data is proposed. Constructing semantic ontology big data distribution set of students' thought and behavior trends, establishing semantic ontology fusion feature distribution set of students' thought and behavior trend estimation by adopting multi-source parameter distributed reconstruction and phase space fusion analysis methods, analyzing the parameter feature quantity of students' thought and behavior trend distribution fusion by combining ambiguity detection and information feature matching methods, and constructing association rule distribution set of students' thought and behavior trend estimation by adopting global ambiguity reconstruction and feature reconstruction methods. Through fuzzy detection and information fusion, the semantic structure characteristics of students' ideological and behavioral trends are analyzed. By matching ideological and behavioral characteristics and mining statistical information, students' ideological and behavioral trends are estimated and self-adaptive convergence control is realized, and the optimal solution of students' ideological and behavioral trends estimation is obtained.

Symboleo is a formal specification language for legal contracts that was introduced to address this issue. Symboleo specifications directly encode legal concepts such as parties, obligations, and powers. In this paper, we propose a tool-supported method for translating Symboleo specifications into smart contracts. We have extended the current Symboleo IDE, implemented the ontology and semantics of Symboleo into a reusable library, and developed the Symboleo2SC tool to generate Hyperledger Fabric code exploiting this library. Symboleo2SC was evaluated with three sample contracts. The results shows that legal contract specifications in Symboleo can be fully converted to SCs for monitoring purposes. Moreover, Symboleo2SC helps simplify the SC development process, saves development effort, and helps reduce risks of coding errors.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","300–310","","","","","","","MODELS '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","blockchain; smart contracts; domain-specific languages; code generation; legal ontology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, a huge number of proteins have been discovered. However, there are a great number of proteins without functional annotations. A protein usually has multiple functions and some functions or biological processes require interactions of a plurality of proteins. Additionally, Gene Ontology provides a useful classification for protein functions and contains more than 40,000 terms. We propose a deep learning framework called DeepGOA to predict protein functions with protein sequences and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks. For protein sequences, we extract two types of information: sequence semantic information and subsequence-based features. We use the word2vec technique to numerically represent protein sequences, and utilize a Bi-directional Long and Short Time Memory (Bi-LSTM) and multi-scale convolutional neural network (multi-scale CNN) to obtain the global and local semantic features of protein sequences, respectively. Additionally, we use the InterPro tool to scan protein sequences for extracting subsequence-based information, such as domains and motifs. Then, the information is plugged into a neural network to generate high-quality features. For the PPI network, the Deepwalk algorithm is applied to generate its embedding information of PPI. Then the two types of features are concatenated together to predict protein functions. To evaluate the performance of DeepGOA, several different evaluation methods and metrics are utilized. The experimental results show that DeepGOA outperforms DeepGO and BLAST.","2020-01","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","2208–2217","","6","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Washington, DC, USA Publisher: IEEE Computer Society Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Existing data discovery benchmarks do not model such multimodality and multiplicity of data sources. Moreover, benchmarks of CASs prioritize only evaluating end-to-end task performance. To catalyze research on evaluating the data discovery performance of multimodal data retrievers in CASs within a real-world setting, we propose CMDBench, a benchmark modeling the complexity of enterprise data platforms.

Thus, the earlier sentiment analysis approach is based on unimodal data, and less effort is paid to the multimodal data. However, the presence of multimodal information helps us to get a clearer understanding of the sentiment. To the best of our knowledge, less work has been introduced on the image–text multimodal sentiment analysis framework of Assamese, a low-resource Indian language mostly spoken in the northeast part of India. We built an Assamese news articles dataset consisting of news text and associated images and one image caption to conduct an experimental study. Focusing on important words and discriminative regions of the images mostly related to sentiment, two individual unimodal such as textual and visual models are proposed. The visual model is developed using an encoder-decoder–based image caption generation system. An image–text multimodal approach is proposed to explore the internal correlation between textual and visual features for joint sentiment classification. Finally, we propose the multimodal sentiment analysis framework, i.e., Textual Visual Multimodal Fusion, by employing a late fusion scheme to merge the three different modalities for the final sentiment prediction. Experimental results conducted on the Assamese dataset built in-house demonstrate that the contextual integration of multimodal features delivers better performance than unimodal features.","2023-06","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","","","6","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","caption generation; late fusion; low resource language; machine learning classifier; Multimodal sentiment analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Divergent extremist and mainstream contexts challenge machine interpretation, with a particular threat to the precision of classification algorithms. Radicalization is a subtle long-running persuasive process that occurs over time. Our context-aware computational approach to the analysis of extremist content on Twitter breaks down this persuasion process into building blocks that acknowledge inherent ambiguity and sparsity that likely challenge both manual and automated classification. Based on prior empirical and qualitative research in social sciences, particularly political science, we model this process using a combination of three contextual dimensions – religion, ideology, and hate – each elucidating a degree of radicalization and highlighting independent features to render them computationally accessible. We utilize domain-specific knowledge resources for each of these contextual dimensions such as Qur'an for religion, the books of extremist ideologues and preachers for political ideology and a social media hate speech corpus for hate. The significant sensitivity of the Islamist extremist ideology and its local and global security implications require reliable algorithms for modelling such communications on Twitter. Our study makes three contributions to reliable analysis: (i) Development of a computational approach rooted in the contextual dimensions of religion, ideology, and hate, which reflects strategies employed by online Islamist extremist groups, (ii) An in-depth analysis of relevant tweet datasets with respect to these dimensions to exclude likely mislabeled users, and (iii) A framework for understanding online radicalization as a process to assist counter-programming. Given the potentially significant social impact, we evaluate the performance of our algorithms to minimize mislabeling, where our context-aware approach outperforms a competitive baseline by 10.2% in precision, thereby enhancing the potential of such tools for use in human review.","2019-11","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","","","CSCW","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","user modeling; contextual dimensions; islamist extremism; multi-dimensional modeling; radicalization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the literature, many cases of useful transformations of business process models can be found. However, in general each transformation has been developed in an ad-hoc fashion, at a quite low-level, and its quality is often neglected. To ensure the quality of the transformations is important to apply to them all the well-known software engineering principles and practices, from the requirements definition to the testing activities. For this reason, we propose a method, MeDMoT, for developing non-trivial Model to Text Transformations, which prescribes how to: (1) capture and specify the transformation requirements; (2) design the transformation, (3) implement the transformation and (4) test the transformation. The method has been applied in several case studies, including a transformation of UML business processes into inputs for an agent-based simulator.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","138–141","","","","","","","SAC '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Pau, France","","","","UML; model-driven; model to text transformations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These schemas, also known as semantic models, can only be partially created automatically and require oversight and refinement by human modellers. Non-expert users, such as mechanical engineers or municipal workers, often have difficulty building models because they are faced with multiple ontologies, classes, and relations, and existing tools are not designed for non-expert users. The PLASMA framework consists of a platform and auxiliary services that focus on providing non-expert users with an accessible way to create and edit semantic models, combining automation approaches and support systems such as a recommendation engine. It also provides data conversion from raw data to RDF. In this paper we highlight the main features, like the modeling interface and the data conversion engine.

A common method for compound-protein relation identification is the use of &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; screening experiments. However, the number of compounds and proteins is massive, and &lt;italic&gt;in vitro&lt;/italic&gt; screening experiments are labor-intensive, expensive, and time-consuming with high failure rates. Researchers have developed a computational field called virtual screening (VS) to aid experimental drug development. These methods utilize experimentally validated biological interaction information to generate datasets and use the physicochemical and structural properties of compounds and target proteins as input information to train computational prediction models. At present, deep learning has been widely used in computer vision and natural language processing and has experienced epoch-making progress. At the same time, deep learning has also been used in the field of biomedicine widely, and the prediction of CPRs based on deep learning has developed rapidly and has achieved good results. The purpose of this study is to investigate and discuss the latest applications of deep learning techniques in CPR prediction. First, we describe the datasets and feature engineering (i.e., compound and protein representations and descriptors) commonly used in CPR prediction methods. Then, we review and classify recent deep learning approaches in CPR prediction. Next, a comprehensive comparison is performed to demonstrate the prediction performance of representative methods on classical datasets. Finally, we discuss the current state of the field, including the existing challenges and our proposed future directions. We believe that this investigation will provide sufficient references and insight for researchers to understand and develop new deep learning methods to enhance CPR predictions.","2021-03","2025-09-10 14:12:16","2025-09-10 14:12:16","","2092–2110","","4","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Washington, DC, USA Publisher: IEEE Computer Society Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Along this line, in this paper we propose a novel generative model over KGs for relevance search, named GREASE. The model applies to meta-path based relevance where a meta-path characterizes a particular type of semantics of relating the query entity to answer entities.

It has several applications in the field of bioinformatics like annotating/measuring gene-gene or protein-protein semantic similarity, identifying genes/proteins by their GO annotations for disease gene and target discovery, etc. To determine semantic similarity between genes, several semantic measures have been proposed in literature, which involve information content of &lt;italic&gt;GO-terms&lt;/italic&gt;, GO tree structure, or the combination of both.

Then using the statistical machine translation approach, which in our use case significantly outperforms neural machine translation, we validated the excepted high quality of the translations. The trained model failed to translate Aramaic texts of other dialects. However, when we trained the same statistical machine translation model on another Aramaic-Hebrew corpus of a different dialect (Zohar, 13th century), a very high translation score was achieved. We examined an additional important cultural heritage source of Aramaic texts, the Babylonian Talmud (early 3rd to late 5th century).

We start by combining psycholinguistic-based surprisal scores and optimization to generate two bilevel surprisal optimization problems (an Explicit one and a simpler Implicit one) whose solutions correspond directly to the desired set of fakes. As bilevel problems are usually hard to solve, we then show that these two bilevel surprisal optimization problems can each be reduced to equivalent surprisal-based linear programs. We performed detailed parameter tuning experiments and identified the best parameters for each of these algorithms. We then tested these two variants of SbFAKE (with their best parameter settings) against the best performing prior work in the field.

Therefore, in this article, we introduce Syntax and Semantic Driven Network (SSDN) to equip syntax and semantic knowledge across languages simultaneously. Specifically, predicate–argument structures from semantic role labelling are explicitly incorporated into word representations. Then, a semantic-aware relational graph convolutional network and a transformer-based encoder are utilized to model both semantic dependency and syntactic dependency structures, respectively. Finally, a fusion module is introduced to integrate output representations adaptively. We conduct experiments on the widely used Automatic Content Extraction 2005 English, Chinese, and Arabic datasets.

However, most ontology mapping approaches rely heavily on human annotation and are restricted to limited domains. Moreover, most prior work is limited to combining a few mapping factors with moderate mapping accuracy, and the ontology mapping weigh calculation process is not adaptive and dynamic. Based on the current generalization of ontology mapping methods, we propose a novel ontology mapping system called HISDOM to improve the generalization performance of ontology mapping. HISDOM uses comprehensive factors like concept names, attributes, instances, and structural similarities to determine the similarity of ontology. A key novelty of HISDOM is leveraging CNN to calculate the comment similarity to assist the mapping process of concepts in the ontology. Then, HISDOM dynamically derives the weight of different factors in the overall ontology similarity proportional to the amount of information of each factor in the ontology. Finally, based on the overall similarity, HISDOM determines whether the two concepts in the ontology can be mapped. We study the performance of HISDOM through extensive experiments. The results show that HISDOM outperforms several baselines in ontology mapping tasks, the dynamic and adaptive weighting mechanism is effective, and all the mapping factors of HISDOM are positive towards improving the ontology mapping accuracy.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","67–70","","","","","","","BDCAT '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Auckland, New Zealand","","","","ontology mapping; convolutional neural network; dynamic weight; hybrid similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides a textbook, reference, and technology roadmap for professionals working in this and related areas.This third volume focuses on state-of-the-art multimodal language and dialogue processing, including semantic integration of modalities. The development of increasingly expressive embodied agents and robots has become an active test-bed for coordinating multimodal dialogue input and output, including processing of language and nonverbal communication. In addition, major application areas are featured for commercializing multimodal-multisensor systems, including automotive, robotic, manufacturing, machine translation, banking, communications, and others. These systems rely heavily on software tools, data resources, and international standards to facilitate their development. For insights into the future, emerging multimodal-multisensor technology trends are highlighted for medicine, robotics, interaction with smart spaces, and similar topics. Finally, this volume discusses the societal impact of more widespread adoption of these systems, such as privacy risks and how to mitigate them. The handbook chapters provide a number of walk-through examples of system design and processing, information on practical resources for developing and evaluating new systems, and terminology and tutorial support for mastering this emerging field. In the final section of this volume, experts exchange views on a timely and controversial challenge topic, and how they believe multimodal-multisensor interfaces need to be equipped to most effectively advance human performance during the next decade.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery and Morgan &amp; Claypool","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Oviatt, Sharon; Schuller, Björn; Cohen, Philip R.; Sonntag, Daniel; Potamianos, Gerasimos; Krüger, Antonio","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To approach these challenges, without claiming to be exhaustive, we identify a set of products, which includes research question, data, and requirements, and define relations and properties of these products. Based on a cell biological case study and a prototypical implementation, we show how the formal structuring of the conceptual model assists in building a simulation model.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","2353–2364","","","","","","","WSC '20","","","","IEEE Press","Orlando, Florida","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, the executable Trigger-Action Programming (TAP) rules have become the mainstream paradigm for IoT end-user programming. To simplify the creation of TAP rules, many studies have proposed various levels of requirements abstraction, yet the connections between them remain unclear. In this article, we employ a mixed-methods study to identify the preferred way of expressing end users’ requirements in practical scenarios. Subsequently, from the perspective of requirements engineering, we categorize the needs of smart home into three hierarchical levels of abstraction. Accordingly, we propose an innovative multi-level requirements description language called SH-RDL. We also address potential challenges and conduct an evaluation to validate SH-RDL’s usability, understandability and error-prevention. This will aid in the broader adoption of IoT end-user programming.","2025-04","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","","","2","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Requirements Engineering; IoT End-User Programming; Requirements Description Language; Smart Homes; User Intentions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Herein, the digital twin (DT) concept is regarded as a key technology to create value with smart services [2]. Although the research and applications of DTs emerge continuously many concerns are to be scrutinized [3]. The lack of a shared conceptual framework for DTs with an unambiguous terminology [4] complicates cross-functional discussions. Therefore, a systematization of the main dimensions of DTs is proposed in the form of an ontology and a conceptual framework thereof derived. The research questions addressed in this paper are a) «Which dimensions are used to classify and structure DTs in academic literature?», b) «What are the fundamental differences or specifications within these dimensions?» and c) «How do these different specifications relate to each other?» The focus of the research is on the objective to find classification systematics that are a) representing the entire spectrum of DTs, b) universally valid in all DT related domains and c) applicable in research and practice. A systematic literature review on the relevant aspects of DTs was conducted and the findings iteratively advanced within workshop sessions with academic experts. DTs are considered as integrators of physical and digital worlds as well as internal and external value creation. Further, the creation of DTs requires per definition the use of digital data. Hence, the proposed ontology and conceptual framework for DTs include the following main dimensions to consider for every DT: Data resources, external value creation and internal value creation. The main subdimensions of the data resources are the data sources to obtain the data, the data categories and the data formats. The main subdimension of the external value creation are the attributes of the services as the basis of the value propositions, the level of smartness of the connected products and the actors on the different levels of the ecosystem. The main subdimensions of the internal value creation are the lifecycle phases of products, the product management levels and the different generations of both. The proposed ontology and conceptual framework support researchers and practitioners in positioning and structuring their intended DT activities and communicating them to internal and external stakeholders. The holistic view on the data resource dimension further allows to easily deduct the needed data for certain applications or deduct possible applications from already available data.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","13–23","","","","","","","ICISS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cambridge, United Kingdom","","","","ontology; Digital Twin; conceptual framework; systematization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Understanding APT is crucial for adapting to their evolving tactics and effectively mitigating their infiltration methods. A key approach to accurately analysing and detecting APTs involves studying the behaviour, identifying their attack stage and uncovering the employed components. Existing works for APT detection heavily rely on network traffic analysis, limiting their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. This paper introduces a novel method to analyse and detect APT behaviours by constructing a domain-specific knowledge graph (APT-KG), utilising the MITRE ATT&amp;CK framework as its foundation. A hierarchical clustering-based model is proposed to uncover the correlations among various network attack techniques. It first vectorizes the attack techniques according to ATT&amp;CK standards, filtering out low-frequency techniques to optimise dimensionality reduction. Parent-child relationships within the ATT&amp;CK classification further facilitate this process. We observe that this strategy can reveal fully connected relationships among high-frequency techniques, while connections are preserved within clusters between high and low-frequency techniques. This structured representation enables the inference of potential attack patterns, achieving a prediction accuracy of 88.11%. We then integrate the identified associations with APT-KG. Experimental validation demonstrates that APT-KG significantly enhances understanding of attack interrelations and improves the efficiency of APT detection and response mechanisms.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","1480–1484","","","","","","","WWW '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sydney NSW, Australia","","","","knowledge graph; data mining; network security; ontology construction; advanced persistent threat (apt)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nowadays, multiple areas can be aborded by ontologies and the semantic web world, as the subject of this project, mechanics. Mechanics have been accentuated in a visible way, where the reality of living without means of transportation is not feasible in people's lives. The development of new methods to increase the knowledge of drivers and everyday people about automated vehicles is essential. Regarding cars, revisions, maintenance, inspections, change of parts, among others, are necessary and ""mandatory"" subjects and due to this, it is possible to prevent future damage by prolonging the life of the car. In certain cases, this doesn't happen, either due to wear of parts or unforeseen events, and despite being a busy market, drivers are not always informed about the best cares to take or the problems that may arise. As such, the theme of this project is to make a relationship between mechanical details, issues, and solutions, throughout an ontology, to help an everyday driver to a better perception of what he encounters at hand. For that purpose, the defined ontology was exposed via a mobile application, with it providing to the user, several details that he can or not relate, and trough them, provide a connection with a certain problem and solution. The semantic web ontology was developed in Protégé, exposed into Apache Jena Fuseki server, and was running in an Azure Virtual Machine, allowing it to be available into the OutSystems application.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","169–175","","","","","","","ICFET '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Yokohama, Japan","","","","‘Mobile Development'; ‘Ontology’; 'Semantic Web’; 'Vehicles Maintenance'","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extractively migrating systems towards a software product line (SPL) can be a remedy. A feature model (FM) represents all potential configurations of an SPL, ideally, in non-technical domain terms. However, yielding a sensible FM from automated synthesis remains a major challenge due to domain knowledge being a prerequisite for features to be adequate abstractions. In incremental reverse engineering, subsequent generation of FMs may further overwrite changes and design decisions made during previous manual FM refinement.In this paper, we propose an approach to largely automate the synthesis of a suitable FM from a set of cloned MATLAB/Simulink models as part of reverse engineering an SPL. We fully automate the extraction of an initial, i.e., a technical, FM that closely aligns with realization artifacts and their variability, and further provide operations to manually refine it to incorporate domain knowledge. Most importantly, we provide concepts to capture such operations and to replay them on a structurally different technical FM stemming from a subsequent reverse engineering increment that included further systems of the portfolio. We further provide an implementation and demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using two MATLAB/Simulink data sets from the automotive domain.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","","","","","","","","SPLC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, Quebec, Canada","","","","mapping; synthesis; 150% model; clone-and-own; feature model; incremental; individual; MATLAB/Simulink; refinement; variability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Various databases provide detailed information about vulnerabilities in software systems or the way to exploit it, but face severe limitations. The information is scattered across these databases, fluctuates in quality and granularity, and provides only an insight into a single vulnerability per entry. Even for a single software system it is challenging for any security-related stakeholder to determine the threat level, which consists of all vulnerabilities of the software system and its environment (i.e., operating system). Manual vulnerability management is feasible only to a limited extend if we want to identify all configurations that are affected by vulnerabilities, or determine a system's threat level and the resulting risk we have to deal with. For variant-rich systems, we also have to deal with variability, allowing different stakeholders to understand the threats to their particular setup. To deal with this variability, we propose vulnerability feature models, which offer a homogeneous view on all vulnerabilities of a software system. These models and the resulting analyses offer advantages in many disciplines of the vulnerability management process. In this paper, we report the research plan for our project, in which we focus on the model-based evaluation of vulnerabilities. This includes research objectives that take into account the design of vulnerability feature models, their application in the process of vulnerability management, and the impact of evolution, discovery, and verification of vulnerabilities.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","112–119","","","","","","","SPLC '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Montreal, QC, Canada","","","","Vulnerability; Feature Model; Exploit; Variability Model; Vulnerability Analysis and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They independently develop and deploy distributed services in the network. One characteristic of microservices is decentralized data management. Each microservice may use different data management technology which best fit its needs. Hence, it is an issue to integrate data of heterogenous microservices to come up with consolidate data views. Flexible and efficient solutions in this scenario are needed. This work is based on the use of a canonical data model as the mechanism for data integration in microservices. The canonical data model is the reference for query specifications and data integration. This work proposes and implements a microservice architecture based on this strategy and it is composed by nodes that intercommunicate through several mechanisms (e.g., SPARQL, GraphQL and JDBC queries, calls to REST services and proprietary APIs). The solution was analyzed in a proof of concept in a fictitious scenario but using real services available at DBPedia and Twitter. The evaluation goal was to qualitatively analyze the use of the architecture in the design, development and execution of microservices in order to identify the characteristics one should consider when using the canonical data model strategy. The evaluation employed the criteria of ISO/IEC 25010 model that most relate to the SOA challenges, which were: usability; performance; compatibility; and, maintainability. The identified advantages and disadvantages of using the architecture (i.e., the strategy) can be used by architects and developers to make their development decisions.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","","","","","","","","SBSI '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: São Bernardo do Campo, Brazil","","","","service-oriented architecture; canonical data model; microservice architecture; multistore; polyglot persistence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Such relations are building blocks for large-scale taxonomies, ontologies and knowledge graphs. Recently, much progress has been made for hypernymy prediction in English using textual patterns and/or distributional representations. However, applying such techniques to other languages is challenging due to the high language dependency of these methods and the lack of large training datasets of lower-resourced languages. In this work, we present a family of fuzzy orthogonal projection models for both monolingual and cross-lingual hypernymy prediction. For the monolingual task, we propose a Multi-Wahba Projection (MWP) model to distinguish hypernymy vs. non-hypernymy relations based on word embeddings. This model establishes distributional fuzzy mappings from embeddings of a term to those of its hypernyms and non-hypernyms, which consider the complicated linguistic regularities of these relations. For cross-lingual hypernymy prediction, a Transfer MWP (TMWP) model is proposed to transfer the semantic knowledge from the source language to target languages based on neural word translation. Additionally, an Iterative Transfer MWP (ITMWP) model is built upon TMWP, which augments the training sets of target languages when target languages are lower-resourced with limited training data. Experiments show i) MWP outperforms previous methods over two hypernymy prediction tasks for English; and ii) TMWP and ITMWP are effective to predict hypernymy over seven non-English languages.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","1965–1976","","","","","","","WWW '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, CA, USA","","","","cross-lingual transfer learning; hypernymy prediction; Multi-Wahba Projection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Syst.","","1046-8188","10.1145/3419972","https://doi.org/10.1145/3419972","With the large quantity of textual information produced on the Internet, a critical necessity is to filter out the irrelevant information and organize the rest into categories of interest (e.g., an emerging event). However, supervised-learning document filtering methods heavily rely on a large number of labeled documents for model training. Manually identifying plenty of positive examples for each category is expensive and time-consuming. Also, it is unrealistic to cover all the categories from an evolving text source that covers diverse kinds of events, user opinions, and daily life activities. In this article, we propose a novel attention-based deep relevance model for few-shot document filtering (named ADRM), inspired by the relevance feedback methodology proposed for ad hoc retrieval. ADRM calculates the relevance score between a document and a category by taking a set of seed words and a few seed documents relevant to the category. It constructs the category-specific conceptual representation of the document based on the corresponding seed words and seed documents. Specifically, to filter irrelevant yet noisy information in the seed documents, ADRM employs two types of attention mechanisms (namely whole-match attention and max-match attention) and generates category-specific representations for them. Then ADRM is devised to extract the relevance signals by modeling the hidden feature interactions in the word embedding space. The relevance signals are extracted through a gated convolutional process, a self-attention layer, and a relevance aggregation layer. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets show that ADRM consistently outperforms the existing technical alternatives, including the conventional classification and retrieval baselines, and the state-of-the-art deep relevance ranking models for few-shot document filtering. We also perform an ablation study to demonstrate that each component in ADRM is effective for enhancing filtering performance. Further analysis shows that ADRM is robust under varying parameter settings.","2020-10","2025-09-10 14:12:17","2025-09-10 14:12:17","","","","1","39","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","deep learning; Few-shot learning; document filtering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The two groups of methods, which have different preferences of textual clues, actually play complementary roles in detecting fake news. However, few works consider their integration. In this paper, we study the problem of integrating pattern- and fact-based models into one framework via modeling their preference differences, i.e., making the pattern- and fact-based models focus on respective preferred parts in a post and mitigate interference from non-preferred parts as possible. To this end, we build a Preference-aware Fake News Detection Framework (Pref-FEND), which learns the respective preferences of pattern- and fact-based models for joint detection. We first design a heterogeneous dynamic graph convolutional network to generate the respective preference maps, and then use these maps to guide the joint learning of pattern- and fact-based models for final prediction. Experiments on two real-world datasets show that Pref-FEND effectively captures model preferences and improves the performance of models based on patterns, facts, or both.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","1640–1650","","","","","","","CIKM '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Queensland, Australia","","","","graph neural networks; pattern mining; fact-checking; fake news detection; preference learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, unlike TCM, which has substantial works published to construct a knowledge graph, there is a notable absence of a comprehensive knowledge graph for TVM. This article presents the first endeavor to build a knowledge graph for TVM based on extensive existing resources from TCM. We name our knowledge graph as VietMedKG. We propose a translation and filtration process to adapt TCM knowledge graphs to TVM, identifying the overlapping and unique elements of TVM. In addition, the constructed knowledge graph is then exploited further for developing a curated benchmark for the knowledge graph-based question-answering problem with the potential to support doctors and patients in assisting doctors and patients in identifying various diseases. Our work will not only bridge the gap between TCM and TVM but also set the foundation for future research into TVM community.

Many studies have focused on predicting the actual moments of speaker changes (a.k.a. turn-changing), but to the best of our knowledge, none of them explicitly modeled the turn-management willingness from both speakers and listeners in dyad interactions. We address the problem of building models for predicting this willingness of both. Our models are based on trimodal inputs, including acoustic, linguistic, and visual cues from conversations. We also study the impact of modeling willingness to help improve the task of turn-changing prediction. We introduce a dyadic conversation corpus with annotated scores of speaker/listener turn-management willingness. Our results show that using all of three modalities of speaker and listener is important for predicting turn-management willingness. Furthermore, explicitly adding willingness as a prediction task improves the performance of turn-changing prediction.

Speech signals are calculated into MFCC as audio features. 68-points facial landmarks are annotated from the corresponding videos through the prediction algorithm from the Dlib Library. Eos, a 3-D Morphable Face Model, is applied, using the facial landmarks, to predict the 3-D shape, where we can acquire 3-D landmarks. A machine-learning sequence-tagging model, averaged Structured Perceptron using Viterbi algorithm, is applied for modelling the direct prediction of labial parameters from the acoustic MFCC parameters. The 3-D labial area shape from the 'eos' prediction of a frame is morphed according to the predicted 3-D labial landmarks, forming the 3-D lip sequence, which can be plotted synchronically with the acoustic signal. In this 3-D lip synthesis, acoustic features and realistic lip shapes are directly mapped, where lip units and speech recognition are not applied, preserving more realistic articulatory or personality details; and the predicted geometric shapes are comparable with realistic dynamics, with the comparison indicating that this synthesis is of good effect.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","79–84","","","","","","","ISAIMS '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Beijing, China","","","","Mandarin Chinese; realistic dynamics; speech-driven; 3-D lip synthesis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, the distributed nature of IoT networks and the diversity of its actors lead to the recognition of security and data sharing management as one of the major challenges of the IoT domain. For instance, due to insufficient governance of the shared data within IoT environments, data provider retains little to no control over his assets once he has agreed to share them. Furthermore, data consumers are not able to trace the source of the available resource nor its history processing to assess its quality. All this creates a digital environment that is certainly functional but lacks mutual trust between its actors, which can prevent the domain's full potential to be exploited, and therefore disrupt the implemented services.

In two lab experiments on visual art, participants (N = 30 + 60) assessed drawings produced by two physical robots with different morphologies, under exposure to product, process and producer as three levels of perceptual evidence. The data supports that the human assessment of robot creativity is significantly higher the more is revealed beyond the product about the creation process, and eventually the producer. We find no significant effects of embodiment morphology, contrasting existing hypotheses and offering a more detailed understanding for future work. The latter is also informed by additional exploratory analyses revealing factors potentially influencing creativity assessments, including perceived robot likeability and participants’ experience with robotics and AI.

Speculation about information about politicians and their respective parties have become more constant, such as in electoral periods, investigations on processes, journalistic interest, etc. This can be observed during the electoral period of 2018 in which the search for information about the candidates and their respective parties was notorious. Given that information transparency is paramount for a democratic regime, the organization and consolidation of data from official sources is a reliable tool for consultation and dissemination of knowledge. According to this period, this work sought to understand some cognitive models that explain electoral behavior, which led to the investigation of factors that influence the decision to vote. The observed cognitive models indicate some attitudes, opinions, satisfactions, events and government assessments that interfere to some degree in the choice of vote, approval or disapproval for some purpose. Among the factors of influence observed, there are prosopographic information, which deals with the biography of politicians, and which are available in the various transparency portals. However, the data contained in these platforms are not organized in such a way as to make the information more intelligible and more reliable to the citizen. In this sense, this research is interested in the prosopographic information content, which would be better evaluated if the data of the politicians were organized according to a conceptual model of knowledge. The methodological approach adopted in this research is the Design Science Reserch (DSR), which directs the construction of an artifact in a given context, whose theoretical conjectures are based on the search and production of knowledge. As a result, research contributes to the knowledge base, as it discusses the evolution of cognitive models and through the design of the artifact, delivers reliable and relevant information about the life of a politician.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","","","","","","","","SBSI '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Aracaju, Brazil","","","","Conceptual Modeling; Data Transparency; Organized Information; Prosopography Politicial","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To assure the validity and accuracy of the application, the data has to abide by curation requirements similar to those ruling digital libraries. We present a novel, inquiry-driven curation approach aimed to optimize multimodal datasets curation and maximize data reuse by domain researchers. We demonstrate the method through the ASTRIAGraph project, in which multiple data sources about near earth space objects are aggregated into a central knowledge system. The process involves multidisciplinary collaboration, resulting in the design of a data model as the backbone for both data curation and scientific inquiry.

We present a model-driven approach to analyse the quality of research data. It allows abstracting from the underlying database technology. Based on the observation that many quality problems show anti-patterns, a data engineer formulates analysis patterns that are generic concerning the database format and technology. A domain expert chooses a pattern that has been adapted to a specific database technology and concretises it for a domain-specific database format. The resulting concrete patterns are used by data analysts to locate quality problems in their databases. As proof of concept, we implemented tool support that realises this approach for XML databases.

Recognizing the breadth of this year's program, we are publishing two sets of proceedings: one dedicated to research track papers, the Web4Good track, and keynotes; and a companion proceedings featuring the Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, and History of Web sessions. Through this rich assortment of activities, we aim to foster a vibrant community where delegates can share ideas, forge collaborations, and cultivate a sustainable, inclusive environment.Marking its 34th edition, WWW'25 welcomes more than 1,000 industry and academic experts eager to shape the future of Web technologies and applications. The conference logo, depicting the Sydney Harbour Bridge, symbolizes the Web's key function of ""connecting"" people and information. Originally founded at CERN in 1994 as the International World Wide Web Conference (WWW), this event has long been the leading venue for research, development, standards, and applications related to the Web.Over the years, WWW has introduced important breakthroughs, from The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Web Search Engine in 1998-which heralded Google-to the EigenTrust algorithm in 2003 and the YAGO knowledge base in 2007. In the period between 2024 and 2025, large language models (LLMs) have significantly influenced countless industries and everyday life, prompting fundamental shifts in the Web ecosystem. We anticipate that the research and discussions at this year's conference will spark further breakthroughs in this rapidly evolving field.Continuing the tradition of depth and diversity, WWW'25 accepted 26 workshops and 20 tutorials as pre-conference events. In addition, consistent with previous editions, we feature a Demo Paper Track, Short Paper Track, PhD Symposium, Special Day, Resource Track, History of Web sessions, and Artifact Badging. Some of these are incorporated into the main conference schedule to encourage communication and collaboration among attendees.A commitment to diversity is pivotal to fostering robust, sustainable Web technologies. Our Web4Good track highlights how Web-based tools can address societal challenges, while the Industry Track showcases novel and impactful results from the industrial sector. This year, we have also launched an Emerging World Track to broaden participation from developing countries, as well as a competition track to enhance industry engagement..Organizing WWW'25 has been a true team effort. We sincerely thank the authors who contributed their work, and we extend our gratitude to the program and senior program committees for their dedication to reviewing submissions and offering feedback. We also appreciate the many additional chairs whose efforts ensured that each element of the program ran smoothly. Together, they have helped this conference continue to grow into a premier event for the Web research community.Finally, we would like to thank ACM SIGWEB and our industry sponsors-Meta, Huawei, Google, Baidu, Taobao, JD, and Infinigence-for their generous support, as well as our local government sponsors, Business Event Sydney and the NSW Government. We are equally grateful to our academic partner, the University of Technology Sydney, and the PCO company, ICMSA, for their indispensable help with registration, venue logistics, and social events. Their collective contributions have made the 2025 edition of this conference a resounding success.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, education must be oriented towards mathematics and natural sciences accompanied by social and human sciences. Therefore, this study aims to describe the empowerment of critical thinking skills through a problem-based learning model viewed from the epigenetic aspect. This research employed library research. In this study, data collection was obtained from news, articles in journals, and relevant books. The analysis was carried out in four stages: 1) data collection, 2) data reduction, 3) data display, and 4) conclusion. This study's results revealed that learning needs to pay attention to nature and nurture because it dramatically affects the mastery of thinking skills, and bridging the two things in learning will be a challenge for science teachers in the future. The problem-based learning model can be utilized as a natural science learning model that can empower critical thinking skills from an epigenetic perspective. It can be concluded that the cellular and molecular mechanisms of learning and memory have long been a major focus of neurology and molecular biology, a concern regarding the epigenetic mechanisms behind dynamic changes in the transcription of genes responsible for memory formation and maintenance.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","","","","","","","","ICLIQE '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Surakarta, Indonesia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dynamic argument-based assurance cases, which present structured arguments supported by evidence, have emerged as a systematic approach to evaluating and mitigating safety risks and hazards in AI-enabled system development and have also been extended to deal with broader normative goals such as fairness and explainability. This paper introduces a systems-engineering-driven framework, supported by software tooling, to operationalise a dynamic approach to argument-based assurance in two stages. In the first stage, during the requirements planning phase, a multi-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder team define goals and claims to be established (and evidenced) by conducting a comprehensive fairness governance process. In the second stage, a continuous monitoring interface gathers evidence from existing artefacts (e.g. metrics from automated tests), such as model, data, and use case documentation, to support these arguments dynamically. The framework’s effectiveness is demonstrated through an illustrative case study in finance, with a focus on supporting fairness-related arguments.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","18–28","","","","","","","FAccT '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","continuous fairness monitoring; large language models in finance; system transparency artefacts; trustworthy and ethical assurance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although the effects of anthropomorphic AI are often benign, anthropomorphic design features also create new kinds of risk. For example, users may form emotional connections to human-like AI, creating the risk of infringing on user privacy and autonomy through over-reliance. To better understand the possible pitfalls of anthropomorphic AI systems, we make two contributions: first, we explore anthropomorphic features that have been embedded in interactive systems in the past, and leverage this precedent to highlight the current implications of anthropomorphic design. Second, we propose research directions for informing the ethical design of anthropomorphic AI. In advancing the responsible development of AI, we promote approaches to the ethical foresight, evaluation, and mitigation of harms arising from user interactions with anthropomorphic AI.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","13–26","","","","","","","AIES '24","","","","AAAI Press","San Jose, California, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Logic-based IR models upgrade the IR process from document-query comparison to an inference process, in which both documents and queries are expressed as sentences of the selected formal logic. The underlying formal logic also permits one to represent and integrate knowledge in the IR process. One of the main obstacles that has prevented the adoption and large-scale diffusion of logic-based IR systems is their complexity. However, several logic-based IR models have been recently proposed that are applicable to large-scale data collections. In this survey, we present an overview of the most prominent logical IR models that have been proposed in the literature. The considered logical models are categorized under different axes, which include the considered logics and the way in which uncertainty has been modeled, for example, degrees of belief or degrees of truth. Accordingly, the main contribution of the article is to categorize the state-of-the-art logical models on a fine-grained basis, and for the considered models the related implementation aspects are described. Consequently, the proposed survey is finalized to better understand and compare the different logical IR models. Last, but not least, this article aims at reconsidering the potentials of logical approaches to IR by outlining the advances of logic-based approaches in close research areas.","2019-02","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","","","1","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","uncertainty; information retrieval models; survey; Formal logics; logical models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The LNEC - National Laboratory for Civil Engineering’s strategy is used as an exploratory case study. Semantic web technologies are used to perform strategy analysis, including validating the strategy formulation and supporting the strategy execution by assessing performance indicators, verifying the design of cause-and-effect relationships between strategic objectives, and monitoring and empirically validating these relationships. The increased interoperability of these technologies enables information sharing across systems and organizations. Following the strategy analysis, recommendations are provided, leading to a more robust and data-driven strategic management approach, enabling accurate, traceable, and continuous monitoring of an organization’s strategy.

The need for a NER system able to be trained with few-annotated examples comes in all its urgency in domains where the annotation process requires time, knowledge and expertise (e.g., healthcare, finance, legal), and in low-resource languages. In this survey, starting from a clear definition and description of the few-shot NER (FS-NER) problem, we take stock of the current state-of-the-art and propose a taxonomy which divides algorithms in two macro-categories according to the underlying mechanisms: model-centric and data-centric.

We analyzed discrepancies between the KCs generated by the Large Language Model (LLM) and those made by humans through evaluation from three domain experts in each subject area. This evaluation aimed to determine whether, in instances of non-matching KCs, evaluators showed a preference for the LLM-generated KCs over their human-created counterparts. We also developed an ontology induction algorithm to cluster questions that assess similar KCs based on their content. Our most effective LLM strategy accurately matched KCs for 56% of Chemistry and 35% of E-Learning MCQs, with even higher success when considering the top five KC suggestions. Human evaluators favored LLM-generated KCs, choosing them over human-assigned ones approximately two-thirds of the time, a preference that was statistically significant across both domains.

These modules, known as uniform interpolants, retain only ""relevant names"" while preserving their meanings in the absence of other names. UI holds significant potential across various domains where tailored ontology modules are required. However, realizing its full potential demands highly optimized techniques for generating such modules. Previous studies have identified notable challenges in generating uniform interpolants for EL-ontologies, where their computation is substantially more complex and computationally demanding than standard subset modules.Despite these obstacles, this paper introduces an advanced ""forgetting"" method tailored for computing uniform interpolants of ELIO-ontologies with ABoxes. We show that with effective normalization and inference strategies, these uniform interpolants can be computed efficiently, matching the speed of standard module computation. A comprehensive evaluation using a prototype implementation of this method achieved a 100% success rate on two major benchmark datasets, Oxford-ISG and BioPortal, with results delivered within seconds. The efficiency of our approach is attributed to our novel linear strategy for introducing definers, in sharp contrast to existing strategies that lead to an exponential increase in definers and computational inefficiency. Our method is unique in its ability to create signature-restricted modules for large-scale ontologies, making it a vital addition to the community's toolkit.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","2940–2949","","","","","","","CIKM '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Boise, ID, USA","","","","ontologies; forgetting; uniform interpolation; description logics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In many cases, multiple ontologies are created independently for different purposes in the same biomedical domain. To fuse and extend existing knowledge, we need to find the corresponding entities (i.e. classes and properties) from different ontologies. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) is a mature mathematical tool for biomedical ontology matching tasks and has achieved competitive performance. The FCA-based method mainly matches the ontologies through lexical tokens and structural information. This method ignores the inherent semantics of entities. On the other hand, representation learning techniques are widely used in different NLP tasks to capture the semantic similarity of words. In this paper, we propose a novel biomedical ontology matching method which we dub DeepFCA. We use pre-trained word vectors to initialize the vector representations onto which semantic information is inscribed. FCA embedding techniques are used to refine these vectors. DeepFCA combines FCA and word2vec methods to enhance the performance of biomedical ontology matching. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply FCA embedding techniques to biomedical ontology matching. Experiments on real-world biomedical ontologies show that DeepFCA improves the recall and F1-measure compared with the traditional FCA-based algorithm. It also achieves competitive performance compared with several state-of-the-art systems.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:18","2025-09-10 14:12:18","","259–265","","","","","","","ICMHI '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Kamakura City, Japan","","","","Artificial intelligence; Biomedical ontology matching; Word embedding; Formal concept analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper undertakes the first phase of the main research project, which aims to develop a framework for guiding software developers to actively manage traceability. After inquiring into and examining previous research on this topic, the links between artefacts and their functions were identified. The analysis resulted in the development of a new model for requirement traceability, defined in the form of an ontology portraying the contributively relations between software artefacts using common properties with the aid of Protégé Software.

Model-driven development approaches manage this trade-off and increase the degree of internal QA maintainability. In this work, we propose an ontology-based communication mechanism among software components to handle the trade-off. The approach increases the degree of internal QAs such as modifiability, maintainability, testability during the design and development phases without compromising the external QAs for the end users during the operation phase. We also evaluate a prototype system to validate the proposed approach using Software Architecture Analysis Method (SAAM). It is also easier to integrate into the software development lifecycle as compared to existing model-driven approaches.

Maintaining these vocabularies and keeping up with their changes are manual tasks with very limited automated support, impacting both publishers and users. Existing work shows that machine learning can be used to reliably predict vocabulary changes, but on specific domains (e.g. biomedicine) and with limited explanations on the impact of changes (e.g. their type, frequency, etc.). In this paper, we describe a framework that uses various supervised learning models to learn and predict changes in versioned vocabularies, independent of their domain. Using well-established results in ontology evolution we extract domain-agnostic and human-interpretable features and explain their influence on change predictability. Applying our method on 139 WV from 9 different domains, we find that ontology structural and instance data, the number of versions, and the release frequency highly correlate with predictability of change. These results can pave the way towards integrating predictive models into knowledge engineering practices and methods.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","193–200","","","","","","","K-CAP '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, USA","","","","ontology evolution; change modelling; vocabulary change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The pervasiveness of digital platforms and the growing interest in a sharing (rather than ownership) style of consumption have allowed for sharing practices to scale up and become a widespread phenomenon. Digital sharing platforms offer a wide variety of services which appear to be more affordable, efficient, and accessible than their conventional counterparts, making them more attractive in the eyes of consumers. The DSE has manifested itself most remarkably in consumer-to-consumer (C2C) and business-to-consumer (B2C) sharing models. New business models have been created to capture and offer the values driving the emerging sharing trend.The innovative, digitally enabled mode of providing access to resources as a service in the DSE has changed consumption patterns both at micro level, as a change in individual lifestyles, and at macro level, manifested in a transformation of socio-economic structures. These ongoing changes may have both positive and negative implications for society from a sustainability perspective. Recognising that the (potential and actual) impacts of sharing platforms on sustainability have not been studied in a systematic way yet, the present paper aims to develop a systematic insight into this interaction by focusing on the business models emerging around sharing platforms as a central starting point. To achieve this, we use a typology of business models that recognizes the affordances and key attributes of sharing in the DSE. The typology covers both C2C and B2C models of sharing. Based on this typology, we discuss the implications of each type of sharing model for sustainability by asking two central questions: How may the given type of sharing affect resource consumption? And what will be the potential impacts on social practices and structures? We hope that the present study can serve as a guideline for assessing the sustainability impacts of sharing platforms – either already operating in the market or envisaged. By highlighting the aspects most relevant from a sustainability point of view, we expect to contribute to an evolution of the DSE business models towards sustainable development.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","77–87","","","","","","","ICT4S2020","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Bristol, United Kingdom","","","","Digital sharing economy; Information and communication technology (ICT); Resource consumption; Sharing business models; Sharing platforms; Socio-economic structures; Sustainability impacts","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this research, we explore granularity (of data features) and context (of data instances) as dimensions underpinning conceptual mappings.

In practice, DM is ensured by multiple actors such as operators or device manufacturers, each operating independently via their DM solution. These siloed DM solutions are limited in addressing IoT threats related to device dependencies, such as cascading failures, as these threats spread across devices managed by different DM actors, and their mitigation can no longer be performed without collaborative DM efforts. The first step toward collaborative mitigation of these threats is the identification of threatening dependency topology. However, this task is challenging, requiring the inference of dependencies from the data held by different actors. In this work, we propose a collaborative framework that infers the threatening topology of dependencies by accessing and aggregating data from legacy DM solutions. It combines the assets of Semantic Web standards and Digital Twin technology to capture on-demand the topology of dependencies, and it is designed to be used in business applications such as customer care to enhance customer Quality of Experience. We integrate our solution within the in-use Orange's Digital Twin platform Thing in the future and demonstrate its effectiveness by automatically inferring threatening dependencies in the two settings: a simulated smart home scenario managed by ground-truth DM solutions, such as Orange's implementation of the USP Controller and Samsung's SmartThings Platform, and a realistic smart home called DOMUS testbed.","2023-09","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","32–48","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; SHACL; semantic web; digital twin; inference; collaboration; dependencies management; entity resolution; IoT device management; thing description","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Following this idea, we propose a catalogue of 17 novel refactorings specific to multi-level models. Their objective is to help designers in rearranging elements across and within meta-levels and exploring the consequences.

In recent years, neural networks-based algorithms perform high efficiency in processing text classification. This paper put forward some of the efficient algorithms used in text classification, Like BPNN, CNN, BiLSTM, and CRNN, for resume parsing. The original resumes are parsed by splitting them into words, and word base is trained to get the most appropriate word, which has a high score in the resume is resulting suitable job for each resume.

Colonialism has a history of altering the beliefs and values of colonized peoples; in this paper, I argue that this history is recapitulated in current LLM alignment practices and technologies. Furthermore, I suggest that AI alignment be decolonialized using three forms of openness: openness of models, openness to society, and openness to excluded knowledges. This suggested approach to decolonial AI alignment uses ideas from the argumentative moral philosophical tradition of Hinduism, which has been described as an open-source religion.

It categorizes the task into two broad categories according to the type of input dialogues, i.e., open-domain and task-oriented, and presents a taxonomy of existing techniques in three directions, namely, injecting dialogue features, designing auxiliary training tasks, and using additional data. A list of datasets under different scenarios and widely accepted evaluation metrics are summarized for completeness. After that, the trends of scenarios and techniques are summarized, together with deep insights into correlations between extensively exploited features and different scenarios. Based on these analyses, we recommend future directions, including more controlled and complicated scenarios, technical innovations and comparisons, publicly available datasets in special domains, and so on.","2023-10","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","","","3","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","abstractive summarization; dialogue context modeling; Dialogue summarization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ACM Multimedia is the premier international conference series in the area of multimedia within the field of computer science. Since 1993, ACM Multimedia has been bringing together worldwide researchers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their innovative research and to discuss recent advancements in multimedia.For the first time since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, this year's conference returns to the Asia-Pacific region and resumes as a full-fledged, inperson event. With no travel restrictions or significant visa challenges, we are excited to once again experience the warmth of face-to-face gatherings, where we can reconnect with colleagues and friends.The enthusiasm and support from the community have been incredible. ACM Multimedia 2024 received over 4,300 main conference submissions, accepting more than 1,100 papers (please refer to the TPC Chairs' message for details). In addition, 10 Grand Challenges were selected from 22 submissions, 18 workshops from 30 submissions, and 8 tutorials from 13 proposals. We've prepared an exciting five-day program: workshops, grand challenges, and tutorials will be held on the 1st and 5th days, with the main conference occupying the middle three days. All accepted papers will be accessible online prior to the conference, and we are working to ensure proceedings are available through the ACM Digital Library around the conference period.This year's conference features three distinguished academic keynote speeches, several prestigious SIGMM award talks, a panel discussion on Generative AI in Multimedia, a refreshed Brave New Idea (BNI) session, and our inaugural industry program.The opening keynote will be delivered by Prof. Pascale Fung from HKUST, a Fellow of AAAI, ACL, and IEEE. Her talk will explore the pressing topic of Agents in the Large Language Model (LLM) Era. Prof. Judy Kay from the University of Sydney, a renowned expert in HCI, user modeling, and ubiquitous computing, will give the second keynote on how to empower individuals to harness and control their multimodal data. The final academic keynote will be presented by Prof. Jiebo Luo from the University of Rochester, a Fellow of ACM, AAAI, IEEE, SPIE, and IAPR, as well as a member of Academia Europaea and the US National Academy of Inventors. He will discuss leveraging LLMs as social multimedia analysis engines.This year, we continue using OpenReview to ensure an open and transparent review process. Thanks to the exceptional efforts of the technical program committee, every paper received at least three reviews before the review announcement. The BNI track has also revamped its review process to align with the main conference, promoting visionary papers. Additionally, we are excited to introduce the industry program to ACM Multimedia for the first time, featuring industry keynote speeches, expert talks, and demonstrations (please refer to the industry chairs' message for further details).We are also committed to making the conference inclusive and accessible. To support students with financial constraints, we have awarded travel grants to at least 25 students from the ACM Multimedia 2024 budget, with an additional 20+ students receiving SIGMM travel grants. Over 20 local students have also been recruited as volunteers, benefiting from complimentary registration. Furthermore, we have arranged childcare facilities to accommodate attendees with young children. A welcome reception will take place on the 2nd day of the conference, followed by a gala dinner on the 3rd day, featuring exciting cultural performances.We hope you find this year's program engaging and thought-provoking and that it offers valuable opportunities to exchange ideas with fellow researchers and practitioners from around the globe.

Improving the informativeness of the representations has led to a tremendous rise in the dimensionality and the memory footprint. It leads to a cascading effect amplifying the complexity of the downstream model by increasing its parameters. The available techniques cannot be applied to cross-modal applications such as text-to-image. To ameliorate these issues, a novel Text-to-Image Fixed-dimensional encoding technique through a self-supervised Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) for semantic evaluation applying transformers (TexIm FAST) has been proposed in this article. The pictorial representations allow oblivious inference while retaining the linguistic intricacies and are potent in cross-modal applications. TexIm FAST deals with variable-length sequences and generates uniform-dimensional images with over 75% reduced memory footprint. It enhances the efficiency of the models for downstream tasks by reducing its parameters. The efficacy of TexIm FAST has been extensively analyzed for the task of Semantic Textual Similarity (STS) on a benchmark dataset and two new datasets put forth containing disproportionate sequences. The results demonstrate its exceptional ability to compare disparate-length sequences such as a text with its summary with 3% improvement in accuracy compared to the SOTA despite having 68% less parameters.","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Semantic Similarity; Text-to-Image; Oblivious Inference; Text Embedding; Transformers NLP; Variational Auto-Encoder","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Expressing a well-formed SPARQL query requires information about the graph structure and the exact URIs of its components, which is impractical for the average user. Question answering (QA) systems assist by translating natural language questions to SPARQL. Existing QA systems are typically based on application-specific human-curated rules, or require prior information, expensive pre-processing and model adaptation for each targeted KG. Therefore, they are hard to generalize to a broad set of applications and KGs. In this paper, we propose KGQAn, a universal QA system that does not need to be tailored to each target KG. Instead of curated rules, KGQAn introduces a novel formalization of question understanding as a text generation problem to convert a question into an intermediate abstract representation via a neural sequence-to-sequence model. We also develop a just-in-time linker that maps at query time the abstract representation to a SPARQL query for a specific KG, using only the publicly accessible APIs and the existing indices of the RDF store, without requiring any pre-processing. Our experiments with several real KGs demonstrate that KGQAn is easily deployed and outperforms by a large margin the state-of-the-art in terms of quality of answers and processing time, especially for arbitrary KGs, unseen during the training.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","knowledge graphs; RDF; just-in-time entity and relation linking; natural language question answering; seq2seq models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research is contributing to this development by exploring how a recommendation for the domain of Business Informatics in German speaking countries can be improved by formalizing the recommendations in a semantic model that relies on sophisticated European ontologies in the domain like the European Learning Model (ELM) and related data models. It employs Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems to create semantic models in an experimental way and evaluates the resulting model quality.

Based on an ontology transformation to B-machines, this article presents an approach to constructing a valid and error-free career agent with Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL). In short, the agent's policy is built on a framework we called Multi State-Actor (MuStAc) using a decentralized training approach. Its purpose is to predict both relevant and valid career steps to employees, based on their profiles and company pathways (observations). Observations can comprise various data elements such as the current occupation, past experiences, performance, skills, qualifications, and so on. The policy takes in all these observations and outputs the next recommended career step, in an environment set as the combination of an HR ontology and an Event-B model, which generates action spaces with respect to formal properties.

As an alternative, self-supervised learning provides a way for representation learning that does not require annotations and has shown promise in both image and video domains. In contrast to the image domain, learning video representations are more challenging due to the temporal dimension, bringing in motion and other environmental dynamics. This also provides opportunities for video-exclusive ideas that advance self-supervised learning in the video and multimodal domains. In this survey, we provide a review of existing approaches on self-supervised learning focusing on the video domain.

The availability of extensive online data creates a need for intelligent systems to help users and archivists understand latent relationships in these collections. A major challenge in cultural heritage studies is the labor-intensive process of analyzing these materials. Inconsistent linguistic terms and ambiguous concepts in digital documents make it difficult to uncover relationships without expert supervision. Moreover, while advanced models based on large-scale pretraining demonstrate strong performance in extracting semantic relationships, they depend on extensive pretraining on large external datasets, limiting their applicability for smaller or specialized collections. We propose a system that combines natural language processing for entity extraction with graph representation learning to model relationships among documents, categories, and n-grams, resulting in a fully-connected network representation. Unlike methods requiring large-scale pretraining, our approach operates effectively using only the information available in the dataset itself, making it particularly suited for smaller cultural heritage document collections. The system extracts significant terms from document metadata, produces embeddings for each document, and uses these embeddings to build a recommendation system for entity discovery. We tested the system on a collection of early 20th-century documents from Crete, evaluating its performance against alternative methods in collaboration with experts from the archival research organization SALT. This approach not only facilitates deeper insights into smaller, specialized collections but also reduces dependency on vast external training resources, enhancing its practical utility in cultural heritage studies.","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:19","2025-09-10 14:12:19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural Language Processing; Machine Learning; Recommendation Systems; Graph Representation Learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Problem: There are many distinguished yet partially-integrated information management systems used to support the life-cycle of Oil and Gas industrial plants. Our approach considers a 3D plants viewer system, a visual navigation system on platforms, and the integrated intelligent search system. However, these systems lack a semantic integration that can guide the user actions over each functionality for a unique asset. Solution: This paper presents the use of KGs to represent and help monitoring and controlling operational and maintenance activities within an Oil and Gas industrial environment. Our approach highlights the challenges and initial work required to establish a fully-integrated management domain, where the execution of the aforementioned activities can easily be managed. SI Theory: This study draws inspiration from Representation Theory, which posits that an information system faithfully mirrors specific phenomena occurring in the physical world. Method: To develop this work, it was necessary to review the literature related to the development of KGs and ontologies. The generated KG was developed using well-established standards like the Industrial Data Ontology (IDO), and the Capital Facilities Information Handover Specification (CFIHOS), complemented with the use of other ontologies. Summary of Results: A prototype of the conceptual KG was implemented, verifying the viability of our approach for data integration.

Yet, building analytics can require data that are external to a building system, e.g., weather data for cooling load forecasting. Such external data can be accessed from external sources, e.g., observatory, yet these data have their own data models and storage methods.To enable portable data access from multiple data sources for building analytics, in this paper, we firstly define building periphery data, and then we study the approach to develop a data model to support building analytics which require both building data and building periphery data. We further develop Cement-α, an ontology-based data access system to extract both building and building periphery data.

In this work, we introduce the goal of domain-specific concordance: the expectation that a recommender model follow a set of expert-defined categorical rules. We propose a regularization-based approach that optimizes for robustness on rule-based input perturbations. To test the effectiveness of this method, we apply it in a medication recommender model over diagnosis-medicine categories, and in movie and music recommender models, on rules over categories based on movie tags and song genres.

In this study, protein sequences served as natural language sentences comprising words. The nominated word embedding-based feature sets, hinged on the word embedding modulation and protein motif frequencies, were useful for feature choosing. Five word embedding types and a variety of conjoint features were examined for such feature selection. The support vector machine algorithm consequentially was employed to perform classification.

Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today.The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way.The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data.

The development of GF started in 1998, first as a tool for controlled language implementations, where it has gained an established position in both academic and commercial projects. GF provides grammar resources for over 40 languages, enabling accurate generation and translation, as well as grammar engineering tools and components for mobile and Web applications. On the research side, the focus in the last ten years has been on scaling up GF to wide-coverage language processing. The concept of abstract syntax offers a unified view on many other approaches: Universal Dependencies, WordNets, FrameNets, Construction Grammars, and Abstract Meaning Representations. This makes it possible for GF to utilize data from the other approaches and to build robust pipelines. In return, GF can contribute to data-driven approaches by methods to transfer resources from one language to others, to augment data by rule-based generation, to check the consistency of hand-annotated corpora, and to pipe analyses into high-precision semantic back ends.

In this work, we apply sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) neural models to Turkish data-to-text generation where the input data given in the form of a meaning representation is verbalized. We explore encoder-decoder architectures with attention mechanism in unidirectional, bidirectional, and stacked recurrent neural network (RNN) models. Our models generate one-sentence biographies and dining venue descriptions using a crowdsourced dataset where all field value pairs that appear in meaning representations are fully captured in reference sentences. To support this work, we also explore the performances of our models on a more challenging dataset, where the content of a meaning representation is too large to fit into a single sentence, and hence content selection and surface realization need to be learned jointly. This dataset is retrieved by coupling introductory sentences of person-related Turkish Wikipedia articles with their contained infobox tables. Our empirical experiments on both datasets demonstrate that Seq2Seq models are capable of generating coherent and fluent biographies and venue descriptions from field value pairs. We argue that the wealth of knowledge residing in our datasets and the insights obtained from this study hold the potential to give rise to the development of new end-to-end generation approaches for Turkish and other morphologically rich languages.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:20","2025-09-10 14:12:20","","","","2","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Wikipedia; Data-to-text generation; sequence-to-sequence model; Turkish","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is an official framework for processing and presenting biographical history-related messages on the semantic web with virtual-reality technology, including biographical events, time and space relationships, related personal messages, and more. We elaborate on this ontology knowledge architecture and explain how to use our ontological structure called BKOnto as a basis for domain-specific knowledge to support virtual presentation. Information management is becoming an important part of cultural collections related technologies, from the management of personal collections to the establishment of large, decentralized ""semantic"" databases. These semantic databases can be used to a certain extent using semantic web technology to process and construct a machine-understandable data network. Such a data network can be linked to the referenced knowledge structure to give a concept and a relationship form specification associated with a set of descriptive objects in the definition domain (person, thing, place, etc.) - that is, link to its meaning. Biographical history of the specific characters is through the life and other areas of a systematic description of the introduction of a text that form. In this paper, we overview some of the Semantic Web-related technologies and describe a cognitive knowledge structure for biographical knowledge representation based on OWL markup language, we call it BKOnto. This is a formal framework for dealing with information about biographical history on the semantic web, including biographical events, temporal and spatial relationships, related information of persons, and so on. We describe this ontology knowledge structure and explain how BKOnto can act as a basis for more domain-specific knowledge representation. In this study, we further present such cultural collections in a virtual reality form, by transforming the ontology cognitive architecture data into a virtual reality exhibition space, allowing users to present the semantic structure in the form of multimedia in a three-dimensional space more easily. Such a form of presentation can be used in the virtual exhibition of the museum, making it easier for museums to organize cultural collections of semantic structures and exert their influence through the Internet.

Feature models help developers to keep an overall understanding of the system, and also support scoping, planning, development, variant derivation, configuration, and maintenance activities that sustain the system's long-term success. Unfortunately, feature models are difficult to build and evolve. Features need to be identified, grouped, organized in a hierarchy, and mapped to software assets. Also, dependencies between features need to be declared. While feature models have been the subject of three decades of research, resulting in many feature-modeling notations together with automated analysis and configuration techniques, a generic set of principles for engineering feature models is still missing. It is not even clear whether feature models could be engineered using recurrent principles. Our work shows that such principles in fact exist. We analyzed feature-modeling practices elicited from ten interviews conducted with industrial practitioners and from 31 relevant papers. We synthesized a set of 34 principles covering eight different phases of feature modeling, from planning over model construction, to model maintenance and evolution. Grounded in empirical evidence, these principles provide practical, context-specific advice on how to perform feature modeling, describe what information sources to consider, and highlight common characteristics of feature models. We believe that our principles can support researchers and practitioners enhancing feature-modeling tooling, synthesis, and analyses techniques, as well as scope future research.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:20","2025-09-10 14:12:20","","62–73","","","","","","","ESEC/FSE 2019","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Tallinn, Estonia","","","","Feature models; software product lines; modeling principles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The integration of these software components, even when the interfaces are heavily documented, can become a daunting task. As part of a typical Software Development Life Cycle, requirements and interfaces change for entire software systems as well as the individual software components that make up those systems.Model-Integrated Computing (MIC) can be used to manage such complexity, and provides a means for validating the system integration throughout its lifecycle. Unfortunately, current MIC tools for ROS systems are limited and lack the ability to automatically gather information needed to make models for ROS entities. This paper presents a new tool, ROS Snapshot, that captures a snapshot of an existing ROS-based system during runtime, and fully documents the system using specified metamodels for each ROS entity. The resulting system model can then be used to document the current state of the system, which is especially important when upgrading versions (e.g. conversion from ROS 1.0 to ROS 2.0). We present a set of current applications for the ROS Snapshot tool, as well as future development plans to integrate the acquired system model into a full MIC system.","2020-10","2025-09-10 14:12:20","2025-09-10 14:12:20","","128–141","","3","36","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Evansville, IN, USA Publisher: Consortium for Computing Sciences in Colleges","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To be useful at scale, the raw information needs to be transformed into a standardized schema that can be easily and reliably used by data analysts. In this work, we tackle the problem of unifying POI categories (e.g. restaurants, temple, and hotel) across multiple data sources to aid in improving land use maps and population distribution estimation as well as support data analysts wishing to fuse multiple data sources with the OpenStreetMap (OSM) mapping platform or working with projects that are already configured in the OSM schema and wish to add additional sources of information.

Recently, prompt-based tuning has demonstrated superior performance to standard fine-tuning in few-shot scenarios by formulating the entity type classification task as a ”fill-in-the-blank” problem. This allows effective utilization of the strong language modeling capability of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs). Despite the success of current prompt-based tuning approaches, two major challenges remain: (1) the verbalizer in prompts is either manually designed or constructed from external knowledge bases, without considering the target corpus and label hierarchy information, and (2) current approaches mainly utilize the representation power of PLMs, but have not explored their generation power acquired through extensive general-domain pre-training. In this work, we propose a novel framework for few-shot FET consisting of two modules: (1) an entity type label interpretation module automatically learns to relate type labels to the vocabulary by jointly leveraging few-shot instances and the label hierarchy, and (2) a type-based contextualized instance generator produces new instances based on given instances to enlarge the training set for better generalization. On three benchmark datasets, our model outperforms existing methods by significant margins.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:20","2025-09-10 14:12:20","","605–614","","","","","","","KDD '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Washington DC, USA","","","","few-shot learning; prompt-based learning; entity typing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address these existing limitations, This study proposes a voice electronic medical record system driven by artificial intelligence and blockchain, which is designed to improve clinical records and nursing coordination. This system adopts a dedicated deep learning architecture. It transcribe the conversations between doctors and patients into text, and then uses natural language processing to extract the relevant medical information. At the same time, it also provides diagnostic prompts, which can reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Doctors can view and edit these summaries generated by artificial intelligence. Then safely record them on the decentralized crypto blockchain ledger. With federated learning, the model can be continuously improved in multiple centers without infringing on data privacy. This solution integrates automatic speech recognition, distributed ledger technology, and collaborative deep learning, aiming to enhance the EMR efficiency, security, data integrity, and care continuity of medical institutions. The combination of blockchain technology and artificial intelligence technology holds great potential.

Recent research aims to address this need by managing variability in space and time simultaneously.

These issues complicate the communication and comprehension of the concepts involved, impeding the development of techniques to unify variability in space and time. To tackle this problem, we performed an iterative, expert-driven analysis of existing tools to derive the first conceptual model that integrates and unifies terminologies and concepts of both dimensions of variability. In this paper, we present the unification process of concepts for variability in space and time, and the resulting conceptual model itself. We show that the conceptual model achieves high coverage and that its concepts are of appropriate granularity with respect to the tools for managing variability in space, time, or both that we considered.

The idea is to use a database, for the integration of the extracted data that will implement the meta-model for the requirements. Problems like inconsistencies and ambiguities can be identified and solved according to the defined meta-model, which will help us in the development and testing phase and will minimize the project chaos.

Moreover, most of the existing ones are not efficient enough due to the lack of semantic information (or contextual knowledge).

In this article, we present an application that extracts all possible karakas from simple Hindi sentences with an accuracy of 84.2% and an F1 score of 88.5%. We consider features such as Parts of Speech tags, post-position markers (vibhaktis), semantic tags for nouns and syntactic structure to grab the context in different-sized word windows within a sentence. With the help of these features, we built a rule-based inference engine to extract karakas from a sentence.

The duration of a sound event can be quite short, which creates great difficulties for, especially weakly labeled, audio tagging. To solve these challenges, we present a novel end-to-end multi-level attention model that first makes segment-level predictions with temporal modeling, followed by advanced aggregations along both time and feature domains. Our model adopts class-aware attention based temporal fusion to highlight/suppress the relevant/irrelevant segments to each class. Moreover, to improve the representation ability of acoustic inputs, a new multi-level feature fusion method is proposed to obtain more accurate segment-level predictions, as well as to perform more effective multi-layer aggregation of clip-level predictions. We additionally introduce a weight sharing strategy to reduce model complexity and overfitting. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted on the AudioSet and the DCASE17 datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method works remarkably well and obtains the state-of-the-art audio tagging results on both datasets.

Trustworthiness can be defined as the trust of a customer in a cloud service and its provider; however, the assurance of this property is not trivial. First, trustworthiness in general is not composed by a single quality attribute, but by the combination of multiple attributes, such as data privacy, performance, reliability, etc. Second, during runtime clients can experience a change of the trustworthiness level required by their application due to the degradation of the cloud service. This article presents a solution that monitors during runtime the set of quality attributes of a specific application and generates adaptation plans in order to certify that an adequate resource amount be provided by the cloud in order to keep its trustworthiness level. Our solution is based on quality models to compute the metric associated to each non-functional requirement and their combination them into different types of trustworthiness levels. The main contribution of the solution is to provide an approach which deals with multiple requirements at the same time (or simultaneously) during runtime in order to adapt the cloud resources to keep the trustworthiness level required by the application. The solution was evaluated by an experiment considering a scenario where the application trustworthiness level was composed by three quality attributes: data privacy, performance and reliability.

For instance, presentations are becoming increasingly non-linear, content is quickly evolving beyond simple text and images and the way we author our presentations is becoming more collaborative. Nevertheless, existing presentation content models are often based on assumptions that do not apply to the current state of presentations any more, making them incompatible for some use cases and limiting the potential of end-user presentation solutions. In order to support state-of-the-art presentation functionality, we rethink the concept of a presentation and introduce a conceptual framework for presentation content. We then present a new content model for presentation solutions based on the Resource-Selector-Link (RSL) hypermedia metamodel.

This paper considers the potential for an emergent model of scientific communication, the research objects data model, to accommodate the complexities of digital humanities collections. Digital humanities collections aggregate and enrich diverse sources of evidence and context, serving simultaneously as ""publications"" and dynamic, interactive platforms for research. The research objects model is an alternative to traditional formats of publication, facilitating aggregation and description of all of the inputs and outputs of a research process, ranging from datasets to papers to executable code. This model increasingly underpins research infrastructures in some scientific domains, yet its efficacy for representing humanities scholarship, and for undergirding humanities cyberinfrastructure, remains largely untested. This study offers a qualitative content analysis of digital humanities collections relying on a content/context analytical framework for characterizing collection components and their interrelationships. This study then maps those components and relationships into a research objects model to identify the model's strengths and limitations for representing diverse digital humanities scholarship.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","138–147","","","","","","","JCDL '19","","","","IEEE Press","Champaign, Illinois","","","","","","","","","","","","digital humanities; data models; digital libraries; research objects","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, most expansion methods are mainly based on the statistics of single terms, which can generate plenty of irrelevant query terms and decrease retrieval performance. To alleviate this problem, we propose an approach that adapts the PRF-based contextual snippets into a context-aware topic model to enhance query representations. Specifically, instead of selecting a series of independent terms, we make full use of the query contextual information and focus on the snippets with the length of n in the PRF documents. Furthermore, we propose a context-aware topic (CAT) model to mine the topic distributions of the query-relevant snippets, namely, fine contextual snippets. In contrast to the traditional topic models that infer the topics from the whole corpus, we establish a bridge between the snippets and the corresponding PRF documents, which can be used for modeling the topics more precisely and efficiently. Finally, the topic distributions of the fine snippets are used for context-aware and topic-sensitive query representations. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we integrate the obtained queries into a topic-based hybrid retrieval model and conduct extensive experiments on various TREC collections. The experimental results show that our query-modeling approach is more effective in boosting retrieval performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.","2018-01","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","topic modeling; Contextual snippet; query representation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We claim that a topic which needs more attention, in particular from the Bx community, is security, especially confidentiality, in the software development process itself. What is then at issue is not what particular users of the software may be allowed to know, but rather, what particular developers of the software may be allowed to know. How can software development processes guarantee to respect confidentiality without compromising effective development? The question is of general interest across software engineering, but model-driven development (MDD) seems a particularly promising arena in which to address it, because of MDD's focus on separation of concerns. In MDD, different people work with separate models, where (ideally) each model records all and only the information necessary to those who work with it. When necessary, the models are reconciled by bidirectional transformations, which automate a process which would otherwise have to be undertaken manually by the groups of experts meeting and studying both their models in order to bring them back into consistency. In model-driven development confidentiality issues become particularly clear and tractable, and bidirectional transformations have a key technical role. We hope to encourage the community to take up this challenge, and in this paper we begin our own analysis of a selection of the issues, focusing particularly on developing a threat model and some examples of secure restoration of consistency.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","1–8","","","","","","","Programming '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Nice, France","","","","Security; Model-driven software development; Confidentiality; Cospan","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The framework, known as the Co-Designing Ontologies Methodology (C-DOM), presents a strategy to draw knowledge from the Subject Matter Expert (SME) without the SME needing to know any-thing about how to create an ontology. The C-DOM framework outlines a series of workshops that align to the layers of the Semantic Technologies architecture and has been developed via an iterative design process and tested in different domains with different levels of complexity and purpose. The first iteration focused on the creation of a light-weight ontology to link generic data in the incident and accident.

This data is collected and preprocessed at considerable expense and is not only required for research, but also by planning offices and other industries in connection with planning activities, such as the creation of municipal heat planning. The NEED ecosystem will accelerate these processes establishing an efficient, robust, and scalable energy data ecosystem. Heterogeneous energy-related data sources will be brought together and automatically linked consistently across different sectors as well as temporal and spatial levels. In this context, existing data sources will not be replaced but rather integrated into the NEED ecosystem as dedicated sources including a semantic description on how to utilize them. In addition to conventional data sources from the various planning levels, we envision a quality assessment scheme based on the FAIR criteria. In reality, we are often faced with missing data, too. To close this gap we explore data-driven, model-driven, AI-based, and tool-driven generation of synthetic data. These heterogeneous data sources will be interlinked using ontology modules which will be represented in a knowledge graph. Via a semantic API, queries will be generated to identify the required data sources, which will be orchestrated to provide the data needed. This will enable researchers, planners, and others including their tools to interact with the NEED ecosystem, while a tool proxy will be able to translate the resulting data into proprietary formats, required by some tools to operate. The NEED ecosystem is planned to be a robust, easy-to-maintain, and flexible infrastructure to enhance planning energy measures at different spatial levels and with different time horizons.

Since models for these tasks frequently rely on an implicit graph structure of the documents or their contents, graph-based document representations are naturally appealing. For tasks that consider the joint occurrence of words or entities, however, existing document representations often fall short in capturing cooccurrences of higher order, higher multiplicity, or at varying proximity levels. Furthermore, while numerous applications benefit from structured knowledge sources, external data sources are rarely considered as integral parts of existing document models. To address these shortcomings, we introduce heterogeneous hypergraphs as a versatile model for representing annotated document collections. We integrate external metadata, document content, entity and term annotations, and document segmentation at different granularity levels in a joint model that bridges the gap between structured and unstructured data. We discuss selection and transformation operations on the set of hyperedges, which can be chained to support a wide range of query scenarios. To ensure compatibility with established information retrieval methods, we discuss projection operations that transform hyperedges to traditional dyadic cooccurrence graph representations. Using PostgreSQL and Neo4j, we investigate the suitability of existing database systems for implementing the hypergraph document model, and explore the impact of utilizing implicit and materialized hyperedge representations on storage space requirements and query performance.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","","","","","","","","SSDBM '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The model offers a conceptual framework that can be used by researchers and practitioners to visualize and describe the progression of HCI knowledge through a sequence of translations.

Operational data analytics (ODA) and holistic monitoring frameworks aim to alleviate this burden by collecting live telemetry from HPC systems. ODA frameworks rely on NoSQL databases for scalability, with implicit data structures embedded in metric names, necessitating domain knowledge for navigating telemetry data relations. To address the imperative need for explicit representation of relations in telemetry data, we propose a novel ontology for ODA, which we apply to a real HPC installation. The proposed ontology captures relationships between topological components and links hardware components(compute nodes, rack, systems) with job's execution and allocations collected telemetry. This ontology forms the basis for constructing a knowledge graph, enabling graph queries for ODA. Moreover, we propose a comparative analysis of the complexity (expressed in lines of code) and domain knowledge requirement (qualitatively assessed by informed end-users) of complex query implementation with the proposed method and NoSQL methods commonly employed in today's ODAs. We focused on six queries informed by facility managers' daily operations, aiming to benefit not only facility managers but also system administrators and user support.

Traditional citation recommendation systems, while well-intentioned, often fall short due to their limited focus on text-based features and lack of contextual awareness. In this article, we introduce the ICA-CRMAS (Intelligent Context-Aware Approach for Citation Recommendation based on Multi-Agent System), an intelligent system that leverages the power of deep learning, semantic analysis, and multimodal learning to overcome these limitations. ICA-CRMAS goes beyond the surface, delving into the rich tapestry of information within academic papers, including figures, which often hold vital contextual clues. By weaving this contextual data directly into its recommendation models, ICA-CRMAS generates highly personalized and relevant suggestions. This comprehensive approach unlocks enhanced accuracy, diversity, and serendipity, enabling researchers to effectively discover papers aligning with their interests and research objectives. ICA-CRMAS illuminates its reasoning. Instead of opaque suggestions, the system provides clear explanations that justify and illustrate recommended citations. This transparency builds user confidence, allowing researchers to critically engage with and trust the system’s recommendations. Evaluation experiments conducted on real-world academic datasets demonstrate that ICA-CRMAS outperforms existing approaches across various metrics. it surpassing its closest competitor by a margin of 7.53 on accuracy, 6.07% on MRR and by 5.87 on Recall.

It is well known that there are two types of preferences: long-term ones and short-term ones. The former refers to users’ inherent purchasing bias and evolves slowly. By contrast, the latter reflects users’ purchasing inclination in a relatively short period. They both affect users’ current purchasing intentions. However, few research efforts have been dedicated to jointly model them for the personalized product search. To this end, we propose a novel Attentive Long Short-Term Preference model, dubbed as ALSTP, for personalized product search. Our model adopts the neural networks approach to learn and integrate the long- and short-term user preferences with the current query for the personalized product search. In particular, two attention networks are designed to distinguish which factors in the short-term as well as long-term user preferences are more relevant to the current query. This unique design enables our model to capture users’ current search intentions more accurately. Our work is the first to apply attention mechanisms to integrate both long- and short-term user preferences with the given query for the personalized search. Extensive experiments over four Amazon product datasets show that our model significantly outperforms several state-of-the-art product search methods in terms of different evaluation metrics.","2019-01","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","","","2","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","attention mechanism; long short-term preference; Personalized product search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the embedding models themselves are often not used directly alongside structured data: they merely serve as additional evidence for structured knowledge extraction. In the metaphactory knowledge graph management platform, we use federated hybrid SPARQL queries for combining explicit information stated in the graph, implicit information from the associated embedding models, and information extracted using vector embeddings in a transparent way for the end user. In this paper we show how we integrated RDF data with vector space models to construct an augmented knowledge graph to be used in customer applications.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","977–980","","","","","","","WWW '18","","","","International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee","Republic and Canton of Geneva, CHE","","","","","","","","event-place: Lyon, France","","","","machine learning; deep learning; knowledge graph; graph embeddings; query federation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the advent of techniques such as RNA-Seq, thousands of lncRNAs are identified in very short time spans. However, due to the poor annotation rate, only a few of them are functionally characterised. The wet lab experiments to elucidate lncRNA functions are challenging, slow progressing and sometimes prohibitively expensive. This work attempts to solve the crucial problem of developing computational methods to predict lncRNA functions. The model presented here, predicts the functions of lncRNAs by making use of a meta-path based measure, AvgSim on a Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN). The network is constructed from existing protein and function association data of lncRNAs, lncRNA co-expression data and protein protein interaction data. Out of the 2,758 lncRNA considered for the experiment, the proposed method predicts possible functions for 2,695 lncRNAs with an accuracy of 73.68 percent and found to perform better than the other state-of-the-art approaches for an independent test set. A case study of two well-known lncRNAs (HOTAIR and H19) is conducted and the associated functions are identified. The results were validated using experimental evidence from the literature.

Due to similar goals, it is often associated with a similar case matching task. To address them, a daunting challenge is assessing the uniquely defined legal-rational similarity within the judicial domain, which distinctly deviates from the semantic similarities in general text retrieval. Past works either tagged domain-specific factors or incorporated reference laws to capture legal-rational information. However, their heavy reliance on expert or unrealistic assumptions restricts their practical applicability in real-world scenarios. In this article, we propose an end-to-end model named LCM-LAI to solve the above challenges. Through meticulous theoretical analysis, LCM-LAI employs a dependent multi-task learning framework to capture legal-rational information within legal cases by a law article prediction sub-task, without any additional assumptions in inference. In addition, LCM-LAI proposes an article-aware attention mechanism to evaluate the legal-rational similarity between across-case sentences based on the law distribution, which is more effective than semantic similarity. We perform a series of exhaustive experiments that include two different tasks that involving four real-world datasets. The results demonstrate that LCM-LAI achieves state-of-the-art performance.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:12:21","2025-09-10 14:12:21","","","","4","43","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","dependent multi-task learning; legal case matching; legal case retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although existing content moderation solutions can filter out several types of toxic content, the audit performance of different vendors and techniques are of varying quality. Some AIGC service providers improve the moderation effectiveness by introducing multiple sources of audit vendors. Due to the lack of general content moderation standards and taxonomy, the labels of multi-source moderation vendors vary greatly. To this end, We propose a novel massive label aggregation approach for content moderation named TCLens. First, we collect results of multi-vendor content moderation engines for building massive toxic labels for AIGC.

With the volume of research growing exponentially every year, a search feature operating over semantically structured content is compelling. Toward this end, in this work, we propose a novel semantic data model for modeling the contribution of scientific investigations. Our model, i.e. the Research Contribution Model (RCM), includes a schema of pertinent concepts highlighting six core information units, viz. Objective, Method, Activity, Agent, Material, and Result, on which the contribution hinges. It comprises bottom-up design considerations made from three scientific domains, viz. Medicine, Computer Science, and Agriculture, which we highlight as case studies. For its implementation in a knowledge graph application we introduce the idea of building blocks called Knowledge Graph Cells (KGC), which provide the following characteristics: (1) they limit the expressibility of ontologies to what is relevant in a knowledge graph regarding specific concepts on the theme of research contributions; (2) they are expressible via ABox and TBox expressions; (3) they enforce a certain level of data consistency by ensuring that a uniform modeling scheme is followed through rules and input controls; (4) they organize the knowledge graph into named graphs; (5) they provide information for the front end for displaying the knowledge graph in a human-readable form such as HTML pages; and (6) they can be seamlessly integrated into any existing publishing process thatsupports form-based input abstracting its semantic technicalities including RDF semantification from the user. Thus RCM joins the trend of existing work toward enhanced digitalization of scholarly publication enabled by an RDF semantification as a knowledge graph fostering the evolution of the scholarly publications beyond written text.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","107–116","","","","","","","JCDL '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, China","","","","ontology; open science; digital libraries; fair data principles; machine actionability; scholarly infrastructure; semantic publishing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wide availability of mobile devices and wireless broadband networks currently leads to wider heterogeneity of fruition contexts and frequent condition changes during a streaming session. MPEG-DASH is the reference standard for Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP: a provider defines several representations for a segmented multimedia source, with different bit rates, allowing a client to dynamically select the best one based on current conditions, and to download the corresponding sequence of segments for smooth playback. MPEG-DASH does not mandate specific bit rate adaptation schemes; conventional approaches are divided in buffer-based, bandwidth-based and hybrid. Nevertheless, Quality of Experience (QoE) can be influenced by many additional factors. This paper proposes a novel QoE adaptation approach based on dynamic ontology-based annotation of streaming context and mobile matchmaking with DASH representation profiles in a Web Ontology Language (OWL) fragment, exploiting a WebAssembly port of an embedded reasoning engine. The proposed framework enables adaptation based not only on network status, but also on client device capabilities, ambient conditions and multimedia content type.

In the current study, we propose a lens on individual and group’s collaborative problem-solving skills, to explore the relationships between dynamic discourse processes and decision making in a distributed information environment. Specifically, we sought to examine CPS skills in association with decision change and productive decision-making. Our results suggest that while sharing information has significantly positive association with decision change and effective decision-making, other aspects of social processes appear to be negatively correlated with these outcomes. Cognitive CPS skills, however, exhibit a strong positive relationship with making a (productive) change in students final decisions. We also find that these results are more pronounced at the group level, particularly with cognitive CPS skills. Our study shed lights on a more nuanced picture of how social and cognitive CPS interactions are related to effective information sharing and decision making in collaborative problem-solving interactions.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","428–437","","","","","","","LAK21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Irvine, CA, USA","","","","decision making; collaborative problem solving; group processes; Hidden-profile paradigm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The latter is particularly true for so-called lightweight markup languages like Mark-down, which only define very limited sets of generic elements.

Even when the fuzzy pattern matching is employed, already existing approaches use these fuzzy values only to find a single best-matching rule, thus immediately discretising the result. Our proposed approach differs in this regard, as we would like to use the fuzzy values resulting from pattern matching as inputs for our probabilistic model. To be more precise, we would like to treat these values as observations for the state estimation in the dynamic Bayesian Network. Our approach is, not coincidentally, similar to the methods typical for state and action recognition. This paper focuses on the Natural Language processing aspect, while the probabilistic model is described in a separate work.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","","","","","","","","PETRA '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Corfu, Greece","","","","natural language processing; conversational agent; semantic similarity; intelligent tutoring system; natural language understanding; computational state space models; dynamic bayesian inference; markov chain; sentence similarity; text similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The digital twin of plant is designed as an intelligent cyber-physical system that has a user-defined knowledge bas and a multi-agent system for planning and modeling of plant growth and development, as well as for forecasting crop parameters. For this purpose, a new method for estimate stage duration and yield is proposed, which defines a ""tube"" – a corridor to each of the factors corresponding plant development.

Thus, it has become a need to generate a brief summary from a large amount of textual data according to the user profile. In this context, text summarization is used to identify important information within text documents. It aims to generate shorter versions of the source text, by including only the relevant and salient information. In recent years, the research on summarization techniques based on topic modeling techniques has become a hot topic among researchers thanks to their ability to classify, understand a large text corpora and extract important topics on the text. However, existing studies do not provide the support of personalization when generating summaries because they need to know not only which documents are most helpful to the users, but also which topics and keywords are more or less related to the user' interests. Thus, existing studies lack of the support of adaptive user modeling for user applications in the emerging areas of automatic summarization, topic modeling and visualization. In this context, we propose a new approach of automated text summarization based on topic modeling techniques and taking into account the user's profile which helps to semantically extract relevant topics of textual documents, summarizing information according to the user' topics interests and finally visualize them through a hyper-graph Experiments have been conducted to measure the effectiveness of our solution compared to existing summarizing approaches based on text content.

Our method is based on subontology generation and semantic difference computation using uniform interpolation, which aids in finding inferred differences that other semantic difference tools do not reveal.

However, developing cyber agility such as moving target defense techniques that are provable safe is a highly complex task that requires significant time and expertise. Our goal is to address this challenge by providing a framework for automating the creation of configuration-based moving target techniques rapidly and safely.In this paper, we present a cyber agility synthesis framework, called MTDSynth, that contains a formal ontology, MTD policy language, and MTD controller synthesis engine for implementing configuration-based moving target defense techniques. The policy language contains the agility specifications required to model the MTD technique, such as sensors, mutation trigger, mutation parameters, mutation actions, and mutation constraints. Based on the mutation constraints, the MTD controller synthesis engine provides an MTD policy refinement implementation for SDN configuration with provable properties using constraint satisfaction solvers. We show several examples of MTD controller synthesis, including temporal and spatial IP mutation, path mutation, detector mutation.We developed our ActivSDN over OpenDaylight SDN controller as an open programming environment to enable rapid and safe development of MTD sense-making and decision-making actions.

Hum.-Robot Interact.","","","10.1145/3732794","https://doi.org/10.1145/3732794","How can intelligent machines assess their competency to complete a task? This question has come into focus for autonomous systems that algorithmically make decisions under uncertainty. We argue that machine self-confidence—a form of meta-reasoning based on self-assessments of system knowledge about the state of the world, itself, and ability to reason about and execute tasks—leads to many computable and useful competency indicators for such agents. This article presents our body of work, so far, on this concept in the form of the Factorized Machine Self-Confidence (FaMSeC) framework, which holistically considers several major factors driving competency in algorithmic decision-making: outcome assessment, solver quality, model quality, alignment quality, and past experience. In FaMSeC, self-confidence indicators are derived via “problem-solving statistics” embedded in Markov Decision Process solvers and related approaches. These statistics come from evaluating probabilistic exceedance margins in relation to certain outcomes and associated competency standards specified by an evaluator. Once designed, and evaluated, the statistics can be easily incorporated into autonomous agents and serve as indicators of competency. We include detailed descriptions and examples for Markov Decision Process agents and show how outcome assessment and solver quality factors can be found for a range of tasking contexts through novel use of meta-utility functions, behavior simulations, and surrogate prediction models. Numerical evaluations are performed to demonstrate that FaMSeC indicators perform as desired (references to human subject studies beyond the scope of this article are provided).","2025-07","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","","","4","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","autonomous robots; human-autonomy interaction; Markov decision processes; probabilistic models; proficiency assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although there are several Knowledge Graphs (KGs) expressed by using CIDOC-CRM, the task of Question Answering (QA) has not been studied over such graphs. For this reason, in this paper we propose and evaluate a Radius-based QA pipeline over CIDOC-CRM KGs for single-entity factoid questions. In particular, we propose a generic QA pipeline that comprises several models and methods, including a keyword search model for recognizing the entity of the question (and linking it to the KG), methods that are based on path expansion for constructing subgraphs of different radius (i.e., path lengths) starting from the recognized entity, i.e., for being used as a context, and pre-trained neural models (based on BERT) for answering the question using the mentioned context. Moreover, since there are no available benchmarks over CIDOC-CRM KGs, we construct (by using a real KG) an evaluation benchmark having 10,000 questions, i.e., 5,000 single-entity factoid, 2,500 comparative and 2,500 confirmation questions. For evaluating the QA pipeline, we use the 5,000 single-entity factoid questions. Concerning the results, the QA pipeline achieves satisfactory results both in the entity recognition step (78% accuracy) and in the QA process (51% F1 score).","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","","","","","","","","HT '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Rome, Italy","","","","Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Graph; Linked Data; Entity Recognition; Cultural Heritage; Answer Extraction; Event-Based Ontology; Path Expansion; Resource Description Framework","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We are moving toward a future of multiple overlapping and co-existing mixed realities. This paper employs protocol fiction as a speculative design method to explore this near-future scenario. We follow the journey of a fictional digital pet rock as it travels through successive protocol eras of mixed reality, adapting to the changing infrastructures and protocols it encounters. Through a comic-style narrative, the story unfolds across four protocol-defined chapters: Centralized Realities, Distributed Realities, Persistent Realities, and Autonomous Realities.

Two-view KG embedding aims to jointly learn continuous vector representations of entities and relations in the aforementioned two-view KGs. In essence, an ontology schema exhibits a tree-like structure guided by class hierarchies, which leads classes to form inheritance hierarchies. However, existing two-view KG embedding models neglect those hierarchies, which provides the necessity to reflect class inheritance. On the other hand, KG is constructed based on a pre-defined ontology schema that includes heterogeneous relations between classes. Furthermore, these relations are defined within the scope of those among classes since instances inherit all the properties of their corresponding classes, which reveals structural similarity between two multi-relational networks. Despite the consideration to bridge the gap among two-view KG representations, existing methods ignore the existence of structural similarity between two-view KGs. To address these issues, we propose a novel two-view KG embedding model, CISS, considering Class Inheritance and Structural Similarity between two-view KGs. To deal with class inheritance, we utilize class sets, each of which is composed of sibling classes, to learn fine-grained class representations. In addition, we configure virtual instance-view KG from clustered instances and compare subgraph representations of two-view KGs to enhance structural similarity between them. Experimental results show our superior performance compared to existing models.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","3931–3941","","","","","","","KDD '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","ontology; knowledge graph; class inheritance; structural similarity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the flurry of research activity in Arabic opinion mining, several researchers have provided surveys to capture advances in the field. While these surveys capture a wealth of important progress in the field, the fast pace of advances in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) necessitates a continuous need for a more up-to-date literature survey. The aim of this article is to provide a comprehensive literature survey for state-of-the-art advances in Arabic opinion mining. The survey goes beyond surveying previous works that were primarily focused on classification models. Instead, this article provides a comprehensive system perspective by covering advances in different aspects of an opinion-mining system, including advances in NLP software tools, lexical sentiment and corpora resources, classification models, and applications of opinion mining. It also presents future directions for opinion mining in Arabic. The survey also covers latest advances in the field, including deep learning advances in Arabic Opinion Mining. The article provides state-of-the-art information to help new or established researchers in the field as well as industry developers who aim to deploy an operational complete opinion-mining system.

Improving data quality is non-trivial, and there is great potential to exploit unstructured text, e.g., from notes, reviews, and comments, for this purpose and to enrich event logs. To this end, this article introduces Text2EL+&nbsp;, a three-phase approach to enrich event logs using unstructured text. In its first phase, events and (case and event) attributes are derived from unstructured text linked to organisational processes. In its second phase, these events and attributes undergo a semantic and contextual validation before their incorporation in the event log. In its third and final phase, recognising the importance of human domain expertise, expert guidance is used to further improve data quality by removing redundant and irrelevant events. Expert input is used to train a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model with customised tags to detect event log elements. The approach applies natural language processing techniques, sentence embeddings, training pipelines and models, as well as contextual and expression validation. Various unstructured clinical notes associated with a healthcare case study were analysed, and completeness, concordance, and correctness of the derived event log elements were evaluated through experiments. The results show that the proposed method is feasible and applicable.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","","","1","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","natural language processing; unstructured text; Event data quality; event log; process mining; semantic validation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Extensions of boolean feature models, as multi-valued attributes or UML-like cardinalities have since been proposed to support variability modelling in complex product lines. In this paper, we propose research directions to address the issue of extracting more complex variability information, as a part of extended feature models synthesis from software descriptions. We consider the capabilities of Formal Concept Analysis, a mathematical framework for knowledge discovery, along with two of its extensions called Pattern Structures and Relational Concept Analysis, to answer this problematic. These frameworks bring theoretical foundations to complex variability extraction algorithms.","2018","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","113–120","","","","","","","VAMOS '18","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Madrid, Spain","","","","Software Product Line; Reverse Engineering; Variability Extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In most cases, there is no registered information about the patient's conditions or medical history. The interveners are either from the private or state health sector. Despite the fact that there are people who can intervene quicker than others, yet they have not been recruited, or work as professional liberal. With the development of technology, systems based on data mining or artificial intelligence have been developed to focus on the intervention's time for example. Although intervention and home-based care are the subject of many studies [1], the resolution of the overall decision-making problem is not sufficiently developed. On the one hand, the state of health presupposes the definition of a patient. There is a set of parameters characterizing the habits of daily life of the person analyzed in parallel with the evolution of physiological and environment. On the other hand, it is necessary to take into consideration the medical Core, his location, his profile not only his professional status but also his abilities and skills that are not explicitly described in his curriculum. Different studies and systems exist in the literature [2]. Each of his studies tackles only a part of the parameters. Indeed, these studies consider either the monitoring of daily activities, the monitoring of physiological data or other environmental parts. Either they consider the specificities of the medical Core's profile, or these systems use a probabilistic data mining that involves many interactions with the experts to interpret the data, either wise an expert system based on the inference rules defined by the medical experts. In addition, most systems do not use controlled vocabulary that provides semantics needed. This complicates information sharing and collaborative work. The objective of the e-SAAD project is to propose a methodological process to facilitate the analysis and procedure of intervention systems and home support. The process should identify the generic and specific aspects of each part. The patient's data set, profile, history, its environment and location should be taken into consideration. As well as the service providers, their profiles, their skills and essentially their availability and locations. These models must be open to be adapted to new data sources.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:22","2025-09-10 14:12:22","","","","","","","","","ICIST '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Cairo, Egypt","","","","Semantic Web; ontology; home-based care; e-SAAD; Telemedicine","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although astonished by their human-like performance, we find they share a significant weakness with many other existing conversational agents in that they all take a passive approach in responding to user queries. This limits their capacity to understand the users and the task better and to offer recommendations based on a broader context than a given conversation. Proactiveness is still missing in these agents, including their ability to initiate a conversation, shift topics, or offer recommendations that take into account a more extensive context. To address this limitation, this tutorial reviews methods for equipping conversational agents with proactive interaction abilities.The full-day tutorial is divided into four parts, including multiple interactive exercises. We will begin the tutorial with an interactive exercise and cover the design of existing conversational systems architecture and challenges. The content includes coverage of LLM-based recent advancements such as ChatGPT and Bard, along with reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) technique. Then we will introduce the concept of proactive conversation agents and preset recent advancements in proactiveness of conversational agents, including actively driving conversations by asking questions, topic shifting, and methods that support strategic planning of conversation. Next, we will discuss important issues in conversational responses' quality control, including safety, appropriateness, language detoxication, hallucination, and alignment. Lastly, we will launch another interactive exercise and discussion with the audience to arrive at concluding remarks, prospecting open challenges and new directions.

In this paper, we focus on the cocktail fork problem, which takes a three-pronged approach to source separation by separating an audio mixture such as a movie soundtrack or podcast into the three broad categories of speech, music, and sound effects (SFX - understood to include ambient noise and natural sound events). We evaluate several deep learning-based source separation models on this task using simple objective measures such as signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR) as well as objective metrics that better correlate with human perception. Furthermore, we thoroughly evaluate how source separation can influence the downstream transcription asks of speech recognition for speech and audio tagging for music and SFX. We also investigate the task of activity detection on the three sources as a way to further improve source separation and transcription. While we observe that source separation improves transcription performance in comparison to the original soundtrack, performance is still sub-optimal due to artifacts introduced by the separation process. Therefore, we thoroughly investigate how remixing of the three separated source stems at various relative levels can reduce artifacts and consequently improve transcription performance. We find that remixing music and SFX interferences at a target SNR of 17.5 dB reduces speech recognition word error rate, and similar impact from remixing is observed for tagging music and SFX content.","2023-07","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","2592–2605","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By representing data as graphs, we can capture entities (i.e., nodes) as well as their relationships (i.e., edges) with each other. Many useful insights can be derived from graph-structured data as demonstrated by an ever-growing body of work focused on graph mining. However, in the real-world, graphs can be both large—with many complex patterns—and noisy, which can pose a problem for effective graph mining. An effective way to deal with this issue is to incorporate “attention” into graph mining solutions. An attention mechanism allows a method to focus on task-relevant parts of the graph, helping it to make better decisions. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive and focused survey of the literature on the emerging field of graph attention models. We introduce three intuitive taxonomies to group existing work. These are based on problem setting (type of input and output), the type of attention mechanism used, and the task (e.g., graph classification, link prediction). We motivate our taxonomies through detailed examples and use each to survey competing approaches from a unique standpoint. Finally, we highlight several challenges in the area and discuss promising directions for future work.","2019-11","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","","","6","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","deep learning; Attention mechanism; graph attention; graph attention survey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In recent years, Android has taken proactive measures to adapt its access control policies for such data, in response to the increasingly strict privacy protection regulations around the world. When each new Android version is released, its privacy changes induced by the version evolution are transparently disclosed, and we refer to them as documented privacy changes (DPCs). Implementing DPCs in Android OS is a non-trivial task, due to not only the dispersed nature of those access control points within the OS, but also the challenges posed by backward compatibility. As a result, whether the actual access control enforcement in the OS implementations aligns with the disclosed DPCs becomes a critical concern. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study on the consistency between the operational behaviors of the OS at runtime and the officially disclosed DPCs. We propose DopCheck, an automatic DPC-driven testing framework equipped with a large language model (LLM) pipeline. It features a serial of analysis to extract the ontology from the privacy change documents written in natural language, and then harnesses the few-shot capability of LLMs to construct test cases for the detection of DPC-compliance issues in OS implementations. We apply DopCheck with the latest versions (10 to 13) of Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Our evaluation involving 79 privacy-sensitive APIs demonstrates that DopCheck can effectively recognize DPCs from Android documentation and generate rigorous test cases. Our study reveals that the status quo of the DPC-compliance issues is concerning, evidenced by 19 bugs identified by DopCheck. Notably, 12 of them are discovered in Android 13 and 6 in Android 10 for the first time, posing more than 35% Android users to the risk of privacy leakage. Our findings should raise an alert to Android users and app developers on the DPC compliance issues when using or developing an app, and would also underscore the necessity for Google to comprehensively validate the actual implementation against its privacy documentation prior to the OS release.","2024-07","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","","","FSE","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","testing; privacy; Android; documentation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is not surprising that a lot of works written by travellers as guides for pilgrims exist. By the beginning of the Renaissance, a more precise image of the world was defined, thanks to the discovery of ancient geographical models, especially the work of Ptolemy. The Italian National Research Project (PRIN) IMAGO — Index Medii Aevi Geographiae Operum — (2020-2023) aims to provide a systematic overview of the medieval and renaissance Latin geographical literature using the Semantic Web technologies and the LOD paradigm. Indeed, until now, this literature has not been studied using digital methods. In particular, this article presents how we formally represented the knowledge about the toponyms, or place names, in the IMAGO ontology. To maximise the interoperability, we developed the IMAGO ontology as an extension of two reference vocabularies: the CIDOC CRM and its extension FRBRoo, including its in-progress reformulation, LRMoo. Furthermore, we used Wikidata as reference knowledge base. As case study, we chose to represent the knowledge related to the toponyms cited by the Italian poet Dante Alighieri in his Latin works.

In the KGC task, Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods have achieved remarkable results due to their advantage of effectively capturing complex relations among entities and generating more accurate and rich entity representations by aggregating information from neighbouring nodes. These methods mainly focus on the representation of entities, and the representation of relations is obtained using simple dimensional transformations or initial embeddings. This treatment ignores the diversity and complex semantics of relations and restricts the efficiency of the model in utilizing relational information in the reasoning process. In this work, we propose the Relational Representation Augmented Graph Attention Network (RRA-GAT), which effectively identifies and weights neighbouring relations that actually contribute to the target relation by filtering out irrelevant information through an attention function based on the information and spatial domain. Furthermore, we capture complex patterns and features in the relational embedding by means of a feed-forward network consisting of a series of linear transformations and nonlinear activation functions. Experiments demonstrate the very advanced performance of RRA-GAT on the link prediction task on standard datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR (e.g., improved the MRR metric on the WN18RR dataset by 7.8% relative improvement).","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","449–455","","","","","","","CSAI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Knowledge graph completion; Graph neural networks; Knowledge graph embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Traditional methods for KG completion rely heavily on entity and relation embeddings, often neglecting the synergistic interaction between graph structures and textual information. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel approach that combines Graph Neural Networks (GNN) with the ConMask model to improve the effectiveness of static knowledge graph completion tasks. Specifically, the GNN is employed to generate entity embeddings based on graph structures, while ConMask extracts key information from text using a relation-dependent content masking mechanism. The model further integrates the embeddings through a multi-head attention mechanism at the embedding layer, fusing the GNN-based entity embeddings with text embeddings. Additionally, the loss function incorporates contrastive learning, which enhances the representational capacity of the embeddings. Experiments are conducted on standard datasets FB15k-237 and WN18RR, evaluated with metrics such as Mean Rank (MR), Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), Hits@1, Hits@3, and Hits@10. The results demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in prediction accuracy.

SaSs conceptual modeling is a non-trivial activity because it is necessary to deal with requirements uncertainty, contextual changes, and behavior adaptation. Since conceptual models are built by humans, their quality heavily depends on the humans expertise, which is not a good software engineering practice. Regarding SaSs, the exposure to quality risks increases because of intrinsic characteristic in this class of system.

Inferring properties from protein amino acid sequences has been a long-standing problem in Bioinformatics. Extensive studies have successfully applied natural language processing (NLP) techniques for the representation learning of protein sequences. In this paper, we applied the deep sequence model - UDSMProt, to fine-tune and evaluate two protein prediction tasks: (1) predict proteins with liquid-liquid phase separation propensity and (2) predict synaptic proteins. Our results have shown that, without prior domain knowledge and only based on protein sequences, the fine-tuned language models achieved high classification accuracies and outperformed baseline models using compositional k-mer features in both tasks. Hence, it is promising to apply the protein language model to some learning tasks and the fine-tuned models can be used to predict protein candidates for biological studies.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","","","","","","","","BCB '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Northbrook, Illinois","","","","protein language model; liquid-liquid phase separation; synaptic proteins","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This task has considerably benefited from pre-trained language models, such as BERT. However, when it comes to the trigger-word mismatch problem in languages without natural delimiters, existing methods ignore the complement of lexical information to BERT. In addition, the inherent multi-role noise problem could limit the performance of methods when one sentence contains multiple events. In this article, we propose a Mask-Attention-based BERT (MABERT) framework for Chinese event extraction to address the above problems. Firstly, in order to avoid trigger-word mismatch and integrate lexical features into BERT layers directly, a mask-attention-based transformer augmented with two mask matrices is devised to replace the original one in BERT. By the mask-attention-based transformer, the character sequence interacts with external lexical semantics sufficiently and keeps its structure information at the same time. Moreover, against the multi-role noise problem, we make use of event type information from representation and classification, two aspects to enrich entity features, where type markers and event-schema-based mask matrix are proposed. Experimental results on the widely used ACE2005 dataset show the effectiveness of our proposed MABERT on Chinese event extraction task compared with other state-of-the-art methods.","2023-07","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","","","7","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Event extraction; event ontology; event type markers; mask-attention-based transformer","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By drawing from recent advances on both fuzz testing and automated model generation, we present three different approaches for fuzzing MDSE tools: A graph grammar-based fuzzer and two variants of a coverage-guided mutation-based fuzzer working with different sets of model mutation operators. Our evaluation on a set of real-world MDSE tools shows that our approaches can outperform both standard fuzzers and model generators w.r.t. their fuzzing capabilities.

Additionally, these queries return hierarchical data in formats such as JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) or XML (Extensible Markup Language). Additional scripts and interfaces are needed to convert hierarchical data into more easily digested tables. To overcome these challenges, each graph database use-case typically involves significant custom software to explore, view, and export data.We introduce Astrolabe, a generalized interface that addresses the challenges of querying graph databases. In Astrolabe, queries are constructed visually, so users do not need to learn new graph query languages.

Currently, English fact-checking has thrived due to various language processing tools and ample datasets. However, the same cannot be said for Vietnamese fact-checking, which faces significant challenges due to the lack of such resources. To address these challenges, we propose a model for checking Vietnamese facts by synthesizing three popular technologies: Knowledge Graph (KG), Datalog, and KG-BERT. The KG serves as the foundation for the fact-checking process, containing a dataset of Vietnamese information. Datalog, a logical programming language, is used with inference rules to complete the knowledge within the Vietnamese KG. KG-BERT, a Deep Learning (DL) model, is then trained on this KG to rapidly and accurately classify information that needs fact-checking. Furthermore, to put Vietnamese complex sentences into the fact-checking model, we present a solution for extracting triples from these sentences. This approach also contributes significantly to the ease of constructing foundational datasets for the Vietnamese KG. To evaluate the model's performance, we create a Vietnamese dataset comprising 130,190 samples to populate the KG. Using Datalog, we enrich this graph with additional knowledge. The KG is then utilized to train the KG-BERT model, achieving an impressive accuracy of 95%. Our proposed solution shows great promise for fact-checking Vietnamese information and has the potential to contribute to the development of fact-checking tools and techniques for other languages. Overall, this research makes a significant contribution to the field of data science by providing an accurate solution for fact-checking information in Vietnamese language contexts.","2023-10","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","","","10","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","knowledge graph; datalog; Fact checking; inference rule; KG-BERT","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Currently, the data entities and the corresponding knowledge on WoT are generally modelled with the ontology, and therefore, matching heterogeneous data entities on WoT can be converted to the problem of matching ontologies. Ontology matching is a complex cognitive process, it is usually initially done manually by domain experts. To effectively distinguish the heterogeneous entities and determine high-quality ontology alignment, this work proposes a word embedding based matching technique. Our approach models the word’s semantic in the vector space, and use two vectors’ cosine angle to measure the corresponding words’ similarity. In addition, the word embedding approach does not depend on a specific knowledge base and retain the rich semantic information of words, which makes our proposal more robust.

To overcome these issues, we introduce AdaMKGC, an innovative hybrid model incorporating an adaptive modality interaction transformer. This model employs a dynamic attention interaction strategy and a self-enhancing sampling approach. AdaMKGC achieves a more precise utilization of multimodal information by integrating modal preference information into modal interactions. Additionally, it effectively mitigates the issue of modal imbalance through targeted sampling and adjustment for entities with deficient information. Experimental evaluations demonstrate AdaMKGC's superior performance in overcoming these prevalent challenges. Compared to existing state-of-the-art MKGC models, AdaMKGC shows a notable enhancement of 28% in MR on the WN18-IMG dataset and an improvement of 2.7% in Hits@1 on the FB15k-237-IMG dataset.

The method first uses the Bi-LSTM model to extract the features of the input text and attribute names. Then, the attention mechanism focuses on the relations between words and attributes in the sentence. Afterward, the global BIO tag marks the position of the attribute values in the sentence. In this way, the method can reduce the workload during the corpus preparation period to improve the generalization ability of the model so that it can extract different weapon attribute data.

Most of the time, these sensors are deployed with a primary purpose (objective) in mind (e.g., deploy sensors to understand noise pollution) by a sensor owner (i.e., the organization that invests in sensing hardware, e.g., a city council). Over the past few years, communities undertaking smart city development projects have understood the importance of making the sensor data available to a wider community—beyond their primary usage. Different business models have been proposed to achieve this, including creating data marketplaces. The vision is to encourage new startups and small and medium-scale businesses to create novel products and services using sensor data to generate additional economic value. Currently, data are sold as pre-defined independent datasets (e.g., noise level and parking status data may be sold separately). This approach creates several challenges, such as (i) difficulties in pricing, which leads to higher prices (per dataset); (ii) higher network communication and bandwidth requirements; and (iii) information overload for data consumers (i.e., those who purchase data). We investigate the benefit of semantic representation and its reasoning capabilities toward creating a business model that offers data on demand within smart city Internet of Things data marketplaces. The objective is to help data consumers (i.e., small and medium enterprises) acquire the most relevant data they need. We demonstrate the utility of our approach by integrating it into a real-world IoT data marketplace (developed by the synchronicity-iot.eu project). We discuss design decisions and their consequences (i.e., tradeoffs) on the choice and selection of datasets.

As the scale and complexity of data analysis tasks continue to grow, the ability to distribute the computational workload across multiple non-communicating processors has become vital for these systems to achieve scalable performance.The joint presence of existential quantification and recursion poses new challenges, currently unsolved by existing distributed systems, which only concentrate on Datalog and are therefore unsuitable for ontological reasoning. When working across multiple processors, generating all the facts to answer a specific reasoning query, avoiding duplication, and guaranteeing termination are non-trivial tasks as infinitely many new symbols and facts can be generated by existential quantification and recursion.In this paper, we address such challenges and introduce the first distributed framework in the Datalog+/- space. We propose the condition of homomorphic decomposability, which identifies sets of Datalog+/- rules with good distribution properties. We put homomorphic decomposability into action with a distributed reasoning algorithm for Warded Datalog+/-, the core of Vadalog. We implement Vadalog Parallel, a distributed reasoner for Vadalog and provide experimental evaluation against state-of-the-art systems.","2024-09","2025-09-10 14:12:23","2025-09-10 14:12:23","","4614–4626","","13","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in order to establish this trust, the provenance of library LD must be provided.In 2018 we conducted a survey which explored the position of Information Professionals (IPs), such as librarians, archivists and cataloguers, with regards to LD. Results indicated that IPs find the process of LD interlinking to be a particularly challenging.

However, Datalog's restriction to flat facts over atomic constants leads to challenges in working with tree-structured data, such as derivation trees or abstract syntax trees. To ameliorate Datalog's restrictions, popular extensions of Datalog support features such as existential quantification in rule heads (Datalog*, Datalog∃) or algebraic data types (Soufflé). Unfortunately, these are imperfect solutions for reasoning over structured and recursive data types, with general existentials leading to complex implementations requiring unification, and ADTs unable to trigger rule evaluation and failing to support efficient indexing.We present DL∃!, a Datalog with first-class facts, wherein every fact is identified with a Skolem term unique to the fact. We show that this restriction offers an attractive price point for Datalogbased reasoning over tree-shaped data, demonstrating its application to databases, artificial intelligence, and programming languages. We implemented DL∃! as a system Slog, which leverages the uniqueness restriction of DL∃! to enable a communication-avoiding, massively-parallel implementation built on MPI.

Identifying and figuring out the traits of unknown fungi through in vitro and in vivo experiments take time and resources. In silico methods yield faster results with a slight drop in accuracy. Modern in silico approaches utilizing deep learning, allow for faster and more accurate classifications. In this study, we perform the classification of one or more gene ontologies of fungi protein sequences. We collected open-source protein sequences from UniProt and applied an algorithm to label the sequences with their gene ontologies. We use ProtBERT with additional layers to give classification results to all the different gene ontologies. Experimental results reveal that when classifying with the top 5 most frequent gene ontologies, the model was able to yield 0.7915 for F1-score, 0.7073 for MCC, and 0.8865 for AuROC. With the top 10 most frequent gene ontologies it yielded 0.6490 for F1-score, 0.6836 for MCC, and 0.7653 for AuROC.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:24","2025-09-10 14:12:24","","","","","","","","","RACS '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Gdansk, Poland","","","","BERT; Gene Ontology; Fungi","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We define four layers: one for capturing timed interactions in heterogeneous systems, one for structured parallelism, one for modeling uncertainty, and one for describing component properties. This framework enables a systematic exploitation of design properties in a design flow by facilitating the stepwise projection of certain layers of interest, the isolated analysis and refinement on projections, and the seamless reconstruction of a system model by virtue of orthogonalization.

At the same time, certain search modalities such as neural IR and conversational search have become more popular. This book, written by international academic and industry experts, brings the field up to date with detailed discussions of these new approaches and techniques. The book is organized in three sections: Foundations, Adaptations and Concerns, and Verticals.Under Foundations, we address topics that form the basic structure of any modern IR system, including recommender systems. These new techniques are developed to augment indexing, retrieval, and ranking. Neural IR, recommender systems, evaluation, query-driven functionality, and knowledge graphs are covered in this section.IR systems need to adapt to specific user characteristics and preferences, and techniques that were considered too niche a few years ago are now a matter of system design consideration. The Adaptations and Concerns section covers the following topics: conversational search, cross-language retrieval, temporal extraction and retrieval, bias in retrieval systems, and privacy in search.While web search engines are the most popular information access point, there are cases where specific verticals provide a better experience in terms of content and relevance. The Verticals section describes eCommerce, professional search, personal collections, music retrieval, and biomedicine as examples.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:24","2025-09-10 14:12:24","","","","","60","","","","","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Alonso, Omar; Baeza-Yates, Ricardo","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, metadata curation remains a labor-intensive task, and the broader challenge of metadata maintenance—ensuring its consistency and usefulness—has been largely overlooked. In this work, we tackle the problem of resolving relationships among metadata concepts from disparate sources. Inferring these relationships are critical for creating clean and consistent metadata repositories, and a central challenge for metadata integration.We propose OpenForge, a two-stage prior-posterior framework for metadata integration. In the first stage, OpenForge exploits multiple methods including fine-tuned large language models to obtain prior beliefs about concept relationships. In the second stage, OpenForge refines these predictions using the Markov Random Field, a probabilistic graphical model. We formalize metadata integration as an optimization problem, where the objective is to identify the relationship assignments that maximize the joint probability of assignments. The MRF formulation allows OpenForge to capture prior beliefs while encoding critical relationship properties, such as transitivity, in probabilistic inference. Experiments on four datasets show the effectiveness and efficiency of OpenForge. In a use case of matching two metadata vocabularies, OpenForge outperforms GPT-4, the second-best method, by 25 F1 points.","2025-09","2025-09-10 14:12:24","2025-09-10 14:12:24","","2914–2927","","9","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: VLDB Endowment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is hard to understand students' perception of identity without also understanding ontological beliefs with regards to a computer scientist. In this study, we explore the nature of a computer scientist. Guided by social identity theory, we designed a study that asked students to describe their definition or ontological belief of what constitutes a computer scientist in contrast to their ability to ascribe a computer science identity to self. Leveraging qualitative methods, we interviewedn = 24 women in computer science (Black and Hispanic, undergraduate and graduate students), in order to explore the role their ontological beliefs had on their computer science identity salience. The research questions guiding this work are: (1) How do Black and Hispanic women describe or define computer scientists? (2) What impact does this definition have on Black and Hispanic women's ability to claim a computing identity? Results suggest that the wide variation in definitions has a negative impact on computer science identity salience.

In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that combines Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), originally developed for dance, to represent and analyze human motion symbolically. We expand the existing LabanEditor to support full-body annotation and integrate it with AMASS, Mediapipe, and Kinect inputs through a SMPL-based format. Our system supports automatic annotation for the local functional and expressive aspects of motion, and enables bidirectional conversion between symbols and motion.

Approaches differ in their support for MLM concepts on the levels of syntax, semantics and pragmatics.The Mediation-based MLM (MedMLM), is a formal theory that defines a multilevel model as an ordered collection of levels that are inter-related by mediators, and can be enriched by inter-level relationships and interactions. The levels of MedMLM are plain class models, and the mediators define inter-level instantiation relations. MedMLM is unique in supporting a modular architecture of levels and mediators.This paper introduces the MedMLM software modeling tool, that is built on top of the FOModeLer class modeling tool. The tool supports MLM construction, querying and reasoning, meta-reasoning, validation, syntax verification, and plain computation.

We employ clinical notes from MIMIC-III and consider competing baselines for clinical text representation, where a set of machine learning and deep learning algorithms are used to classify hospital readmission.

However, the core problem with existing deep learning approaches is that they require an enormous amount of training data in order to provide accurate translations. This training data is extremely expensive to curate, since it generally requires humans to manually annotate natural language examples with the corresponding SQL queries (or vice versa). Based on these observations, we propose DBPal, a new approach that augments existing deep learning techniques in order to improve the performance of models for natural language to SQL translation.

In this paper, we establish the consistency models among different member status and their abilities through analyzing member data and integrating domain knowledge. We use these models to help our members refine their inconsistent status, at the same time, identify ability gaps. To reliably refine a member status, we introduce a practical and human-in-the-loop methodology to build status hierarchy. Conditioned on the hierarchical structure, our modeling process exploits the associations between status and abilities. We applied the technique to LinkedIn member titles – one of the major types of the member status, and member skills – the main ability representations at LinkedIn.

Unlike general clinical discussions, psychotherapy's core components (viz. symptoms) are hard to distinguish, thus becoming a complex problem to summarize later. A structured counseling conversation may contain discussions about symptoms, history of mental health issues, or the discovery of the patient's behavior. It may also contain discussion filler words irrelevant to a clinical summary. We refer to these elements of structured psychotherapy as counseling components. In this paper, the aim is mental health counseling summarization to build upon domain knowledge and to help clinicians quickly glean meaning. We create a new dataset after annotating 12.9K utterances of counseling components and reference summaries for each dialogue. Further, we propose ConSum, a novel counseling-component guided summarization model. ConSum undergoes three independent modules. First, to assess the presence of depressive symptoms, it filters utterances utilizing the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9), while the second and third modules aim to classify counseling components. At last, we propose a problem-specific Mental Health Information Capture (MHIC) evaluation metric for counseling summaries. Our comparative study shows that we improve on performance and generate cohesive, semantic, and coherent summaries. We comprehensively analyze the generated summaries to investigate the capturing of psychotherapy elements. Human and clinical evaluations on the summary show that ConSum generates quality summary.

In this paper, we focus on improving DST module to generate dialogue states in circumstances with limited annotations and knowledge about slot ontology. To this end, we design a dual prompt learning framework for few-shot DST. The dual framework aims to explore how to utilize the language understanding and generation capabilities of pre-trained language models for DST efficiently. Specifically, we consider the learning of slot generation and value generation as dual tasks, and two kinds of prompts are designed based on this dual structure to incorporate task-related knowledge of these two tasks respectively. In this way, the DST task can be formulated as a language modeling task efficiently under few-shot settings. To evaluate the proposed framework, we conduct experiments on two task-oriented dialogue datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed method not only outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot methods, but also can generate unseen slots.

The growing availability of new types of data on the internet brings great opportunity of learning a more comprehensive relationship among drugs, targets, and diseases. However, existing methods often consider drug-target interactions or drug-disease interactions separately, which ignores the dependencies among these three entities. Also, many of them cannot directly incorporate rich heterogeneous information from diverse sources. In this work, we investigate the utility of tensor factorization to model the relationships of drug-target-disease, specifically leveraging different types of online data. Our motivation is two-fold. First, in human metabolic systems, many drugs interact with protein targets in cells to modulate target activities, which in turn alter biological pathways to promote healthy functions and to treat diseases. Instead of binary relationships of &lt;drug, disease&gt; or &lt;drug, target&gt;, a tighter triple relationships &lt;drug, target, disease&gt; should be exploited to better understand drug mechanism of actions (MoAs). Second, medical data could be collected from different sources (i.e., drug's chemical structure, target's sequence, or expression measurements). Therefore, effectively exploiting the complementarity among multiple sources is of great importance. Our method elegantly explores a &lt;drug, target, disease&gt; tensor together with complementarity among different data sources, thus improves prediction accuracy. We achieve this goal by formulating the problem into a coupled tensor-matrix factorization problem and directly optimize it on the nonlinear manifold. Experimental results on real-world datasets show that the proposed model outperforms several competitive methods. Our model opens up opportunities to use large Web data to predict drugs' MoAs in pharmacological studies.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:24","2025-09-10 14:12:24","","218–227","","","","","","","WWW '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: San Francisco, CA, USA","","","","Multi-view learning; Drug discovery; Tensor factorization; Disease analysis; Grassmann manifold; Manifold optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unlike traditional point vector based representation, an order-based representation imposes geometric constraints on the representation vectors for explicitly capturing various semantic relationships that may exist between a pair of concepts. In existing literature, several approaches on order-based embedding have been proposed, mostly focusing on capturing hierarchical relationships; examples include vectors in Euclidean space, complex, Hyperbolic, order, and Box Embedding. Box embedding creates region-based rich representation of concepts, but along the process it sacrifices simplicity, requiring a custom-made optimization scheme for learning the representation. Hyperbolic embedding improves embedding quality by exploiting the ever-expanding property of Hyperbolic space, but it also suffers from the same fate as box embedding as gradient descent like optimization is not simple in the Hyperbolic space. In this work, we propose Binder, a novel approach for order-based representation. Binder uses binary vectors for embedding, so the embedding vectors are compact with an order of magnitude smaller footprint than other methods. Binder uses a simple and efficient optimization scheme for learning representation vectors with a linear time complexity. Our comprehensive experimental results show that Binder is very accurate, yielding competitive results on the representation task. But Binder stands out from its competitors on the transitive closure link prediction task as it can learn concept embeddings just from the direct edges, whereas all existing order-based approaches rely on the indirect edges. In particular, Binder achieves a whopping 70% higher F1-score than the second best method (98.6% vs 29%) in our largest dataset, WordNet Nouns (743,241 edges), when using only direct edges during training.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","980–991","","","","","","","KDD '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Barcelona, Spain","","","","concept graph; binary vector embedding; hierarchical embedding; order embedding","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That, however, is inaccurate, as gender-blindness is merely a synonym for neutrality. Neutrality, because it lacks a concerted effort to subvert, favors hegemonic values and epistemologies, which counters the purported aim of equality. Supposedly objective methods of analysis, such as data gathering and interpreting, are not deprived of this hegemonic bias either. As such, through an acknowledgment of ethics, the designer must recognize that they are, indeed, imbuing their values into their designs, which bears influence on the ways in which the user interacts and interprets those designs, a notion which is especially relevant to a field concerned with user experience. This may be done deliberately or by accident, but it is always inevitable. Ethics is, in this way, inextricable from the design process, and, thus, the present article aims to propose that designing for equality requires the designer to act as an ethical agent — responsibly, consciously, and knowingly — especially if one hopes to avoid a design which embodies and communicates oppressive notions. In particular, within the purview of ethics, and by making use of some case-studies and examples, it argues that designing toward gender equality requires not the more typical gender-blind approach, but rather one which is specifically gender-conscious. Further, this article also offers some suggestions as to how we might begin to act as ethical design agents and implement marginalized epistemologies into the design process.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","","","","","","","","CHI EA '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Hamburg, Germany","","","","Conceptual Model; Ethics; Feminist Design; Gender-Blind Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component that enables end-to-end ASR models to bias towards a list of long-tail words obtained using external contextual information. With only a small overhead in memory use and computation cost, TCPGen can structure thousands of biasing words efficiently into a symbolic prefix-tree, and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output to facilitate the recognition of the biasing words. To enhance TCPGen, we further propose a novel minimum biasing word error (MBWE) loss that directly optimises biasing word errors during training, along with a biasing-word-driven language model discounting (BLMD) method during the test. All contextual ASR systems were evaluated on the public Librispeech audiobook corpus and the data from the dialogue state tracking challenges (DSTC) with the biasing lists extracted from the dialogue-system ontology. Consistent word error rate (WER) reductions were achieved with TCPGen, which were particularly significant on the biasing words with around 40% relative reductions in the recognition error rates. MBWE and BLMD further improved the effectiveness of TCPGen, and achieved more significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen also achieved zero-shot learning of words not in the audio training set with large WER reductions on the out-of-vocabulary words in the biasing list.","2022-11","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","345–354","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When developing variability-intensive software systems such as CPPSs, engineers create heterogeneous engineering artifacts of varying granularity, structure, and level of abstraction in the problem and solution space, e.g., CAD drawings, delta models, and control software artifacts. Managing consistency among these heterogeneous artifacts is essential during the development and maintenance of these systems to reduce development costs and runtime failures. Software product line engineering provides approaches to manage the variability of heterogeneous artifacts. However, these approaches must be adapted and extended to manage consistency in CPPSs and address the additional multidimensional challenges in CPPSs. In this short paper, we outline these challenges, motivate them using a case study, and discuss potential solutions to manage the consistency of engineering artifacts expressing CPPS control software variability. We thereby lay the grounds for a deeper understanding of possible inconsistencies and exploring new methods for managing consistency in control software variability in CPPSs.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","945–949","","","","","","","MODELS Companion '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Linz, Austria","","","","cyber-physical production systems engineering; heterogeneous multi-modeling; software modeling consistency","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, attribute value information is typically not available for new products. To predict unseen attribute values, large quantities of labeled training data are needed to train a traditional supervised learning model. Typically, it is difficult, time-consuming, and costly to manually label large quantities of new product profiles. In this paper, we propose a novel method to efficiently and effectively extract unseen attribute values from new products in the absence of labeled data (zero-shot setting). We propose HyperPAVE, a multi-label zero-shot attribute value extraction model that leverages inductive inference in heterogeneous hypergraphs. In particular, our proposed technique constructs heterogeneous hypergraphs to capture complex higher-order relations (i.e. user behavior information) to learn more accurate feature representations for graph nodes. Furthermore, our proposed HyperPAVE model uses an inductive link prediction mechanism to infer future connections between unseen nodes. This enables HyperPAVE to identify new attribute values without the need for labeled training data. We conduct extensive experiments with ablation studies on different categories of the MAVE dataset. The results demonstrate that our proposed HyperPAVE model significantly outperforms existing classification-based, generation-based large language models for attribute value extraction in the zero-shot setting.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","2259–2270","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","zero-shot learning; attribute value extraction; heterogeneous hypergraph; inductive link prediction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It provides means to claim content authorship, including supporting evidence. Content and metadata are stored in decentralized storage and registered on the blockchain. A token is used to curate these claims, and potential complaints, by staking it on them. Staking is incentivized by the fact that the token is minted using a bonding curve. The tokenomics include the resolution of complaints and enabling the monetization of curated claims. Monetization is achieved through licensing NFTs with metadata enhanced by semantic technologies. Semantic data makes explicit the reuse conditions transferred with the token while keeping the connection to the underlying copyright claims to improve the trustability of the NFTs. Moreover, the semantic metadata is flexible enough to enable licensing not just in the real world. Licenses can refer to reuses in specific locations in a metaverse, thus facilitating the emergence of creative economies in them.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","","","7","20","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","ontology; Metaverse; social media; blockchain; copyright; Non-Fungible Token","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, a technical perspective on ISQ provides useful guidance to meet current challenges. The financial sector is paradigmatic, since it is a traditional business, with highly complex business-critical legacy systems, facing a tremendous change due to market and regulation drivers. We carried out a Mixed-Methods study, performing a Delphi-like study on the financial sector. We developed a specific research framework to pursue this vertical study. Data were collected in four phases starting with a high-level randomly stratified panel of 13 senior managers and then a target panel of 124 carefully selected and well-informed domain experts. We have identified and dealt with several quality factors; they were discussed in a comprehensive model inspired by the ISO 25010, 42010, and 12207 standards, corresponding to software quality, software architecture, and software process, respectively.

The listener monitors the speaker's turn-management (a.k.a. speaking and listening) willingness and his/her own willingness to display backchannel behavior. Many studies have focused on predicting the appropriate timing of the backchannel so that conversational agents can display backchannel behavior in response to a user who is speaking. To the best of our knowledge, none of them added the prediction of turn-changing and participants' turn-management willingness to the backchannel prediction model in dyad interactions. In this paper, we proposed a novel backchannel prediction model that can jointly predict turn-changing and turn-management willingness. We investigated the impact of modeling turn-changing and willingness to improve backchannel prediction. Our proposed model is based on trimodal inputs, that is, acoustic, linguistic, and visual cues from conversations. Our results suggest that adding turn-management willingness as a prediction task improves the performance of backchannel prediction within the multi-modal multi-task learning approach, while adding turn-changing prediction is not useful for improving the performance of backchannel prediction.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","131–138","","","","","","","IVA '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual Event, Japan","","","","multimodal signal processing; multitask learning; turn-management willingness; backchannel; turn-changing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

All previous work in this area has only dealt with the most basic types of relationships. The proposed approach goes beyond the previous work to efficiently handle the hierarchy of social relationships. This article introduces a novel technique named Quantifiable Social Relationship (QSR) analysis for quantifying social relationships to analyze relationships between agents from their textual conversations. QSR uses cross-disciplinary techniques from computational linguistics and cognitive psychology to identify relationships. QSR utilizes sentiment and behavioral styles displayed in the conversations for mapping them onto level II relationship categories. Then, for identifying the level III relationship categories, QSR uses level II relationships, sentiments, interactions, and word embeddings as key features. QSR employs natural language processing techniques for feature engineering and state-of-the-art embeddings generated by word2vec, global vectors (glove), and bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (bert). QSR combines the intrinsic conversational features with word embeddings for classifying relationships. QSR achieves an accuracy of up to 89% for classifying relationship subtypes. The evaluation shows that QSR can accurately identify the hierarchical relationships between agents by extracting intrinsic and extrinsic features from textual conversations between agents.","2023-05","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","","","5","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","machine learning; Agents interaction model; behavioral model; hierarchical relationship analysis; quantifiable relationships; social relationship","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Experiments on PASCAL VOC 2012 show superior performance with 85.7% loss reduction for small objects and 3-4 times faster convergence speed, demonstrating the effectiveness of the energy optimization method.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","28–34","","","","","","","ICIIT '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Object Detection; Anchor-free Detection; Bounding Box Optimization; Energy-Based Models; Multi-component Energy Function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software vulnerabilities are increasing in complexity and scale, posing great security risks to many software systems. Extracting information about software vulnerabilities is a critical area of research that aims to identify and create a structured representation of vulnerability-related information. This structured data helps software systems better understand vulnerabilities and provides security professionals with timely information to mitigate the impact of rapidly growing vulnerabilities while guiding future research to develop more secure systems. However, this process relies on the effectiveness of information extraction to transform manual vulnerability analysis from security experts to digital solutions. Despite its importance, the unique nature of vulnerability information and the fast pace at which machine learning-based extraction methods and techniques have evolved make it challenging to assess the current successes, failures, challenges, and opportunities within this research area. This study presents a systematic literature review aimed at clarifying this complex landscape.Methods. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review (SLR) to explore existing research focusing on extracting information about software security vulnerabilities. We search for 829 primary studies on security vulnerability information extraction from seven widely used online digital libraries, focusing on top peer-reviewed journals and conferences published between 2001 and 2024. After applying our inclusion and exclusion criteria and the snowballing technique, we narrowed our selection to 87 studies for in-depth analysis and addressed four main research questions. We collect qualitative and quantitative data from each study, identifying 34 components such as research problems, methods, contributions, evaluation metrics, results, types of extracted vulnerability information, challenges, and limitations. We use meta-analysis, statistical machine learning, and text-mining techniques to identify themes, patterns, and trends across the primary studies and visualize findings.Results. The study provides an overview of the security vulnerability data landscape, identifies key resources, and guides efforts to improve vulnerability information extraction and analysis. The study finds a diverse landscape of learning algorithms used in security vulnerability information extraction, with Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) being the most dominant. The study identifies key challenges, including feature engineering complexity, lack of a gold-standard corpus, preprocessing errors, generating accurate training data, addressing imbalanced data, multimodality fusion, and graph sparsity in security knowledge graphs.Insights for Future Research Directions. The study underscores the need for advanced extraction approaches, robust datasets, automated annotation methods, and advanced machine learning algorithms to improve the extraction of security vulnerability information. This study also suggests using large language models (LLMs) and transformer models to facilitate the automatic extraction of security-related words, terms, concepts, and phrases and introduce new filtering parameters for user requirements.

However, Web resources come in formats with weak semantics (for example, CSV and JSON), or formats specific to a given application (for example, BibTex, HTML, and Markdown). To solve this problem, Knowledge Graph Construction (KGC) is gaining momentum due to its focus on supporting users in transforming data into RDF. However, using existing KGC frameworks result in complex data processing pipelines, which mix structural and semantic mappings, whose development and maintenance constitute a significant bottleneck for KG engineers. Such frameworks force users to rely on different tools, sometimes based on heterogeneous languages, for inspecting sources, designing mappings, and generating triples, thus making the process unnecessarily complicated. We argue that it is possible and desirable to equip KG engineers with the ability of interacting with Web data formats by relying on their expertise in RDF and the well-established SPARQL query language&nbsp;[2]. In this article, we study a unified method for data access to heterogeneous data sources with Facade-X, a meta-model implemented in a new data integration system called SPARQL Anything. We demonstrate that our approach is theoretically sound, since it allows a single meta-model, based on RDF, to represent data from (a) any file format expressible in BNF syntax, as well as (b) any relational database. We compare our method to state-of-the-art approaches in terms of usability (cognitive complexity of the mappings) and general performance.

Despite extensive epistemological and ethical debates, their metaphysical foundations remain relatively under explored. The orthodox view simply suggests that AI systems, as artifacts, lack well-posed identity and persistence conditions—their metaphysical kinds are no real kinds. In this work, we challenge this perspective by introducing a theory of metaphysical identity of AI systems. We do so by characterizing their kinds and introducing identity criteria—formal rules that answer the questions “When are two AI systems the same?” and “When does an AI system persist, despite change?” Building on Carrara and Vermaas’ account of fine-grained artifact kinds, we argue that AI trustworthiness provides a lens to understand AI system kinds and formalize the identity of these artifacts by relating their functional requirements to their physical make-ups. The identity criteria of AI systems are determined by their trustworthiness profiles—the collection of capabilities that the systems must uphold over time throughout their artifact histories, and their effectiveness in maintaining these capabilities. Our approach suggests that the identity and persistence of AI systems is sensitive to the socio-technical context of their design and utilization via their trustworthiness, providing a solid metaphysical foundation to the epistemological, ethical, and legal discussions about these artifacts.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","1360–1370","","","","","","","FAccT '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","artificial intelligence; machine learning; ontology; deep learning; time; identity; metaphysics; change","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With large neural models and massive available data, current dialogue systems have access to more knowledge than any people in their life. However, current dialogue systems still do not perform at a human level. One major gap between conversational agents and humans lies in their abilities to be aware of social norms. The development of socially-aware dialogue systems is impeded due to the lack of resources. In this paper, we present the first socially-aware dialogue corpus – SocialDial based on Chinese social culture. SocialDial consists of two parts: 1,563 multi-turn dialogues between two human speakers with fine-grained labels, and 4,870 synthetic conversations generated by ChatGPT. The human corpus covers five categories of social norms, which have 14 sub-categories in total. Specifically, it contains social factor annotations including social relation, context, social distance, and social norms. However, collecting sufficient socially-aware dialogues is costly. Thus, we harness the power of ChatGPT and devise an ontology-based synthetic data generation framework. This framework is able to generate synthetic data at scale. To ensure the quality of synthetic dialogues, we design several mechanisms for quality control during data collection. Finally, we evaluate our dataset using several pre-trained models, such as BERT and RoBERTa.

Modeling data in this manner allows us to acknowledge that history is, to some extent, subjective and different perspectives can exist in parallel.

We avail of CIDOC-CRM as our KG’s foundation, though we needed to extend this ontology with various qualifiers (types) and relations to support the competency questions. We illustrate how one can explore the KG to gain insights and answer questions.

In this work, we target the creation of an ontology and knowledge base for literature data representation based on the IFLA Library Reference Model (LRM). IFLA LRM is the main model for book-related data, allowing for a fine representation of the various layers that constitute a book. However, by design, it doesn’t deal with some aspects usually available in literature databases, such as information about authors, literary awards or book themes. As a result, LRM requires some extensions to be able to represent ancillary data. Another challenge is the querying of IFLA LRM knowledge bases, with a performance cost that comes with the fine-grained expressivity of the LRM model, which creates longer and therefore typically slower SPARQL queries. In this work, we propose an extension to the IFLA LRM ontology called IFLA LRM* that targets these limitations including a connection to the vocabulary Schema.org and to the taxonomies Thema and Dewey Decimal, and the representation of literary awards.

This article presents a typology of explanations intended to support the first pillar of an explainability-by-design strategy. Its production has been achieved by pursuing a responsible innovation approach and introducing a new persona within the research and innovation process, i.e., a legal engineer, whose role is to work at the interface of two teams, the compliance and the engineering teams, and to oversee the process of requirement elicitation, which is often opinionated and narrowing. Once explanation requirements have been derived from applicable regulatory requirements, compliance rules, or business policies, they have been mapped to the dimensions of the typology to produce fine-grained explanation requirements, forming computable building blocks that can then be translated into system requirements during the technical design phase. The typology has been co-created with industry partners operating in two sectors: finance and education. Two pilot studies have thus been conducted to test both the feasibility of the generation and computation of explanations on the basis of the typology and the usefulness of the outputs in the light of the state-of-the-art. The typology comprises nine hierarchical dimensions. It can be leveraged to operate a stand-alone classifier of explanations that acts as detective controls within a broader partially automated compliance strategy. A machine-readable format of the typology is provided in the form of a light ontology.","2025-02","2025-09-10 14:12:25","2025-09-10 14:12:25","","","","1","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Artificial intelligence; data protection; explainability; automated decisions; typology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The granularity and the usability of the knowledge are key issues: the former is determined by entity recognition on CTRs, whereas the latter mainly depends on proper relation extraction. Nevertheless, in the state-of-the-art entity recognition methods on CTRs using span representation, the local semantics of behavior are not considered and the sequential features of entity labels within behavior descriptions are not utilized. Besides, domain-specific definitions/forms of the relation types and knowledge representations are also crucial for effective utilization of knowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel knowledge extraction framework on CTRs to address the above concerns. The framework is formed by the Enhanced Security Profiles (ESP) that can be directly utilized by security detection devices. In the ESP framework, we propose 3 modules to facilitate fine-grained and accurate knowledge extractions: (1) The entity recognition module utilizes a label-aware subsequence autoregressive algorithm to integrate local semantic and label sequence features, enabling accurate identification of cybersecurity entities; (2) The relation extraction module employs LLM-based strategies with shared partition representations to enhance semantic understanding and domain relevance; and (3) The security profile generation module leverages Chain-of-Thought reasoning and In-Context Learning to produce machine-readable rules executable in security detection systems. Extensive experiments on 6 datasets demonstrate that the ESP framework largely outperform the state-of-the-art solutions e.g., the Micro-Fl scores on entity recognition and relation extraction are at least 1.54% and 13.12% better, respectively.

From this, we design a language that combines exponentials and coexponentials, producing a duality of lambda abstraction. We formalise this language by giving an extension of a call-by-value simply-typed lambda-calculus with covalues, coabstraction, and coapplication. We develop the semantics of this language using the axiomatic structure of continuations, which we use to produce an equational theory, that gives a complete axiomatisation of control effects. We give a computational interpretation to this language using speculative execution and backtracking, and use this to derive the classical control operators and computational interpretation of classical logic, and encode common patterns of control flow using continuations. By dualising functional completeness, we further develop duals of first-order arrow languages using coexponentials. Finally, we discuss the implementation of this duality as control operators in programming, and develop some applications.","2025-01","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","","","POPL","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","category theory; denotational semantics; classical logic; continuations; control effects; control operators; curry-howard; duality; equational theory; lambda-calculus; type theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Software engineering and AI development share many of the same languages and tools, but AI development as an engineering practice is still in early stages. Mining software repositories of AI models enables insight into the current state of AI development. However, much of the relevant metadata around models are not easily extractable directly from repositories and require deduction or domain knowledge. This paper presents a library called AIMMX that enables simplified AI Model Metadata eXtraction from software repositories. The extractors have five modules for extracting AI model-specific metadata: model name, associated datasets, references, AI frameworks used, and model domain. We evaluated AIMMX against 7,998 open-source models from three sources: model zoos, arXiv AI papers, and state-of-the-art AI papers. Our platform extracted metadata with 87% precision and 83% recall. As preliminary examples of how AI model metadata extraction enables studies and tools to advance engineering support for AI development, this paper presents an exploratory analysis for data and method reproducibility over the models in the evaluation dataset and a catalog tool for discovering and managing models. Our analysis suggests that while data reproducibility may be relatively poor with 42% of models in our sample citing their datasets, method reproducibility is more common at 72% of models in our sample, particularly state-of-the-art models. Our collected models are searchable in a catalog that uses existing metadata to enable advanced discovery features for efficiently finding models.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","81–92","","","","","","","MSR '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seoul, Republic of Korea","","","","Machine Learning; Artificial Intelligence; Metadata Extraction; Model Catalog; Model Metadata; Model Mining","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a decision function, it takes the current dialogue state as input and generates appropriate system’s response. In this paper, we explore the reinforcement learning approaches to solve this problem in an Indic language scenario. Recently, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has been used to optimise the dialogue policy. However, many DRL approaches are not sample-efficient. Hence, particular attention is given to actor-critic methods based on off-policy reinforcement learning that utilise the Experience Replay (ER) technique for reducing the bias and variance to achieve high sample efficiency. ER based actor-critic methods, such as Advantage Actor-Critic Experience Replay (A2CER) are proven to deliver competitive results in gaming environments that are fully observable and have a very small action-set. While, in SDSs, the states are not fully observable and often have to deal with the large action space. Describing the limitations of traditional methods, i.e., value-based and policy-based methods, such as high variance, low sample-efficiency, and often converging to local optima, we firstly explore the use of A2CER in dialogue policy learning. It is shown to beat the current state-of-the-art deep learning methods for SDS. Secondly, to handle the issues of early-stage performance, we utilise a demonstration corpus to pre-train the models prior to on-line policy learning. We thus experiment with the A2CER on a larger action space and find it significantly faster than the current state-of-the-art. Combining both approaches, we present a novel DRL based dialogue policy optimisation method, A2CER and its effectiveness for a task-oriented SDS in the Indic language.","2022-05","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","dialogue management; deep reinforcement learning; Spoken dialogue systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this dissertation, we address these challenges by advocating for formal semantic representation of benchmarking data through the use of ontologies. By providing standardized vocabularies and ontologies, we improve knowledge sharing and promote data interoperability across studies in ML and BBO. In the ML domain, focusing on multi-label classification (MLC), we design an ontology-based framework for semantic annotation of benchmarking data, facilitating the creation of MLCBench - a semantic catalog that enhances data accessibility and reusability.

Decentralized Web architectures, such as Solid, offer a promising solution by empowering users with better control over their data in their personal 'Pods'. However, a significant challenge remains: users must navigate numerous applications to decide which application can be trusted with access to their data Pods. This often involves reading lengthy and complex Terms of Use agreements, a process that users often find daunting or simply ignore. This compromises user autonomy and impedes detection of data misuse. We propose a novel formal description of Data Terms of Use (DToU), along with a DToU reasoner. Users and applications specify their own parts of the DToU policy with local knowledge, covering permissions, requirements, prohibitions and obligations. Automated reasoning verifies compliance, and also derives policies for output data. This constitutes a ""perennial” DToU language, where the policy authoring only occurs once, and we can conduct ongoing automated checks across users, applications and activity cycles. Our solution is built on Turtle, Notation 3 and RDF Surfaces, for the language and the reasoning engine. It ensures seamless integration with other semantic tools for enhanced interoperability. We have successfully integrated this language into the Solid framework, and conducted performance benchmark. We believe this work demonstrates a practicality of a perennial DToU language and the potential of a paradigm shift to how users interact with data and applications in a decentralized Web, offering both improved privacy and usability.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","2238–2249","","","","","","","WWW '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Singapore, Singapore","","","","automated reasoning; usage control; data terms of use; decentralized web; formal modelling; notation 3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Modern software systems are often so sophisticated that their complexity exceeds the limits of human comprehension. These systems must respond to changing goals, dynamic data, unexpected failures, and security threats, among other variable factors in real-world environments. Systems' complexity challenges their interpretability and requires autonomous responses to dynamic changes. Two main research areas explore autonomous systems' responses: evolutionary computing and autonomic computing. Evolutionary computing focuses on software improvement based on iterative modifications to the source code. Autonomic computing focuses on optimising systems' performance by changing their structure, behaviour, or environment variables. Approaches from both areas rely on feedback loops that accumulate knowledge from the system interactions to inform autonomous decision-making. However, this knowledge is often limited, constraining the systems' interpretability and adaptability. This paper proposes a new concept for interpretable and adaptable software systems: self-sustaining software systems (S4). S4 builds knowledge loops between all available knowledge sources that define modern software systems to improve their interpretability and adaptability.

This is likely due to the massive proliferation of Digital Assistants (DAs) such as Amazon Alexa, Siri, or Google Assistant that are revolutionizing the way users interact with machines. DAs allow users to execute a wide range of actions through an interaction mostly based on natural language utterances. However, although DAs are able to complete tasks such as sending texts, making phone calls, or playing songs, they still remain at an early stage in terms of their recommendation capabilities via a conversation. In addition, we have been witnessing the advent of increasingly precise and powerful recommendation algorithms and techniques able to effectively assess users’ tastes and predict information that may be of interest to them. Most of these approaches rely on the collaborative paradigm (often exploiting machine learning techniques) and neglect the huge amount of knowledge, both structured and unstructured, describing the domain of interest of a recommendation engine. Although very effective in predicting relevant items, collaborative approaches miss some very interesting features that go beyond the accuracy of results and move in the direction of providing novel and diverse results as well as generating explanations for recommended items. Knowledge-aware side information becomes crucial when a conversational interaction is implemented, in particular for preference elicitation, explanation, and critiquing steps.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","663–666","","","","","","","RecSys '22","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Seattle, WA, USA","","","","Semantic Web; Knowledge Graphs; Natural Language Processing; Knowledge Representation; Recommender systems; Conversational Agents","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fabrication facilities must deal with re-entrant flows to support multiple types of wafers being produced simultaneously, each with their own deadlines and specifications.

In addition, wafer fabrication consumes large amounts of energy, particularly electricity. Emerging technologies including networked devices may help reduce the energy footprint but can introduce cybersecurity risks. Therefore, this paper presents its modeling and simulation framework to quantify tradeoffs between operational measures of performance, energy consumption, and cybersecurity risks.

Resource limitations preclude them mitigating all but a small number of vulnerabilities on an enterprise network, so proper prioritization of defensive actions are of paramount importance. Current methods of risk prioritization are predominantly expert-based, and many include leveraging Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) risk scores. These scores are assigned by subject matter experts according to conventional methods of qualifying risk. Vulnerability mitigation strategies are then often applied in CVSS score order. Our vulnerability assessment system, in contrast, takes a predominantly data-driven approach. In general, we associate a risk metric of vulnerabilities with existence of corresponding exploits. Our assumption is that if an entity has invested time and money to exploit a particular vulnerability, this is a critical gauge of that vulnerability's importance, and hence risk.Prior work presented a model that allows for the creation of prioritized vulnerabilities based on their association-likelihood with exploits, outperforming then-current methods. Because the initial approach only leveraged one vulnerability feature, we extended the vulnerability feature space by incorporating additional features derived from natural language processing. The importance metric is still given by a vulnerability-exploit relationship, but by processing text descriptions and other available information, our system became significantly more accurate and predictive. We next propose a mechanism that customizes vulnerability risks according to their exploitation likelihood in a contested environment given site-specific threat intelligence information, namely, attacks by an Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group. Utilizing held-back data, we then demonstrate that latently similar vulnerabilities, which could be targeted by the same adversary, see higher risk ratings.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:26","2025-09-10 14:12:26","","49–57","","","","","","","AISec'19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: London, United Kingdom","","","","machine learning; natural language processing; exploit; risk model; vulnerability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, extending these embeddings to abstract concepts such as music, which involves multiple modalities, presents a unique challenge. Our work addresses this challenge by integrating rich multi-modal data into a unified joint embedding space. This space includes: (1) textual, (2) visual, (3) acoustic, and (4) graph-based modality features. By doing so, we mirror cognitive processes associated with music interaction and overcome the disjoint nature of individual modalities. The resulting joint low-dimensional vector space facilitates retrieval, clustering, embedding space arithmetic, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Importantly, our approach carries implications for music information retrieval and recommendation systems. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal model that integrates various data types—text, images, graphs, and audio—for music representation learning. Our model aims to capture the complex relationships between different modalities, enhancing the overall understanding of music. By combining textual descriptions, visual imagery, graph-based structures, and audio signals, we create a comprehensive representation that can be leveraged for a wide range of music-related tasks. Notably, our model demonstrates promising results in music classification, and recommendation systems.

However, technological advances have allowed people to express their opinions and feelings through audio, image and video channels. As a result, sentiment analysis is shifting from unimodality to multimodality. Multimodal sentiment analysis brings new opportunities with the rapid increase of sentiment analysis as complementary data streams enable improved and deeper sentiment detection which goes beyond text-based analysis. Audio and video channels are included in multimodal sentiment analysis in terms of broadness. People have been working on different approaches to improve sentiment analysis system performance by employing complex deep neural architectures. Recently, sentiment analysis has achieved significant success using the transformer-based model.

Following this, an increase in the number of people using digital platforms for buying products online likewise increases the number of questions or enquiries posted about a product on an online shopping platform like Amazon on a day to day basis. Though we have gone completely digital in posting these questions, the answering of these questions is still manual. The forums are rarely active. By the time the user gets an answer to his question, either he has bought that product already through offline means or has lost interest in buying that product since it is time consuming. Moreover, the questions which are asked are mostly repetitive. At times the answers are already out there since they have already been given to some other user who had asked the same question. Also, lot of answers are embedded in the user reviews. Therefore, the answers can be extracted from the existing product reviews. This may lead to increase in sale and greater customer satisfaction as his query is resolved in much lower response time. We have review-based question answering systems that aim at answering the questions from the reviews given on the product by other customers. However, the existing systems have certain drawbacks due to the use of RNN, like missing attention mechanism etc. In this work, we enhance the performance of the existing review based QA systems by carrying out some prototypical experiments with the basic models of NLP and then moving towards more advanced Language Models while identifying and rectifying the shortcomings of the existing model. Further, in this work a thorough comparative analysis of the models and approaches that have been worked on is presented. We have enhanced the current state of the art existing review QA systems by using BERT, BART and also applied various heuristics for comparison.

However, there are two essential problems. One is that there is no open-source dataset on Chinese MOOC. The other problem is semantic information confusion caused by inherent polysemy of Chinese words and ambiguous expressions relatively relying on the context. To further characterize the special features of Chinese MOOC reviews, we build an open-source dataset with clean 5,000 MOOC reviews and propose a sentiment knowledge dependency tree–based graph neural network. The proposed model first uses the latest term frequency–inverse document frequency algorithm to extract high-frequency words and combines it with the Semantic Orientation Pointwise Mutual Information algorithm so a sentiment dictionary in the field of Chinese MOOCs is constructed. Then, the grammatical information of the dependency tree is merged with the sentiment knowledge information of the sentiment dictionary. Next, this novel model uses GCN to capture the long-distance feature information of the sentiment dependency tree and finally adopts the softmax function for sentiment classification. To further improve the model's performance, we also use BERT to enhance the text representation for higher accuracy.

Our study initially utilized the Word2Vec method, combined with Skip-gram and Continuous Bag of Words models to train word vectors, and built an ESG lexicon using seed words.

Over a decade later, formulating robot capabilities remains a significant technical hurdle in bringing robots from the lab into everyday life. This paper introduces Capabilities2, a successor to the original Capabilities package, now reimagined for ROS2. Capabilities2 enhances the original design by enabling advancements in skill-based control techniques and offering a more efficient, extensible framework for defining and utilising robot capabilities. We delve into its application in new real-world scenarios, with a particular focus on human-robot interactions and the deployment of collaborative mobile robots in human-centric environments. Capabilities2 addresses challenges in implementing intuitive, collaborative robots by introducing an abstracted database handler, an object-relational mapping for capability models, and a plugin architecture for capability execution. These features support dynamic capability representation, runtime adaptability, and integration with modern AI techniques for skill-based task planning. By providing a standardised yet flexible framework, Capabilities2 reduces the integration effort required to develop top-level controls for real-world scenarios, facilitating rapid development and deployment. Our contributions include the reimplementation of the Capabilities package in ROS2, enhancements to support contemporary robotic applications, and demonstrations of new use cases enabled by Capabilities2.

We eventually have to grabble with this difficult question, as one of the paramount problems of Natural Language Processing (NLP). In other words, this issue is commonly defined as Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD). The latter is one of the crucial difficulties within the NLP field. In this respect, word vectors extracted from a neural network model have been successfully applied for resolving the WSD problem. Accordingly, this article presents an unprecedented method to disambiguate Arabic words according to both their contextual appearance in a source text and the era in which they emerged. In fact, in the few previous decades, many researchers have been grabbling with Arabic Word Sense Disambiguation.It should be noted that the Arabic language can be divided into three major historical periods: old Arabic, middle-age Arabic, and contemporary Arabic. Actually, contemporary Arabic has proved to be the greatest concern of many researchers. The main gist of our work is to disambiguate Arabic words according to the historical period in which they appeared. To perform such a task, we suggest a method that deploys contextualized word embeddings to better gather valid syntactic and semantic information of the same word by taking into account its contextual uses. The preponderant thing is to convert both the senses and the contextual uses of an ambiguous item to vectors, then determine which of the possible conceptual meanings of the target word is closer to the given context.","2020-10","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","","","6","19","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural language processing; contemporary arabic; contextualized word embeddings; historical dictionary; middle-age arabic; old arabic; recurrent neural networks; word sense disambiguation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Past studies focused on specific ethical issues (e.g., gender bias and fairness in OSS). There is little to no study on the different types of unethical behavior in OSS projects. We present the first study of unethical behavior in OSS projects from the stakeholders’ perspective. Our study of 316 GitHub issues provides a taxonomy of 15 types of unethical behavior guided by six ethical principles (e.g., autonomy). Examples of new unethical behavior include soft forking (copying a repository without forking) and self-promotion (promoting a repository without self-identifying as contributor to the repository). We also identify 18 types of software artifacts affected by the unethical behavior. The diverse types of unethical behavior identified in our study (1) call for attentions of developers and researchers when making contributions in GitHub, and (2) point to future research on automated detection of unethical behavior in OSS projects. From our study, we propose Etor, an approach that can automatically detect six types of unethical behavior by using ontological engineering and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules to model GitHub attributes and software artifacts. Our evaluation on 195,621 GitHub issues (1,765 GitHub repositories) shows that Etor can automatically detect 548 unethical behavior with 74.8% average true positive rate (up to 100% true positive rate).

Some researchers proposed the use of computing tools to automate the building process, but mainly on very narrow sub-areas of cyber security. Thus, there is a lack of general cyber security taxonomies and ontologies, possibly due to the difficulties of manually curating keywords and concepts for such a diverse, inter-disciplinary and dynamically evolving field.This paper presents a new human-machine teaming based process to build taxonomies, which allows human experts to work with automated natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) tools to co-develop a taxonomy from a set of relevant textual documents. The proposed process could be generalized to support non-textual documents and to build (more complicated) ontologies as well.

Adaptation of parser combinators technique for paths querying may solve these problems. Conventional parser combinators process linear input, and only the Trails library is known to apply this technique for path querying. Trails suffers the common parser combinators issue: it does not support left-recursive grammars and also experiences problems in cycles handling.

Each subject is assigned a unique descriptive code, which has a corresponding textual definition. The assignment of Iconclass codes is a challenging task for computational systems, due to the large number of available labels in comparison to the limited amount of training data available. Transfer learning has become a common strategy to overcome such a data shortage. In deep learning, transfer learning consists in fine-tuning the weights of a deep neural network for a downstream task. In this work, we present a deep retrieval framework, which can be fully fine-tuned for the task under consideration. Our work is based on a recent approach to this task, which already yielded state-of-the-art performance, although it could not be fully fine-tuned yet. This approach exploits the multi-linguality and multi-modality that is inherent to digital heritage data. Our framework jointly processes multiple input modalities, namely, textual and visual features. We extract the textual features from the artwork titles in multiple languages, whereas the visual features are derived from photographic reproductions of the artworks. The definitions of the Iconclass codes, containing useful textual information, are used as target labels instead of the codes themselves. As our main contribution, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art by a large margin. In addition, our approach is superior to the M3P feature extractor and outperforms the multi-lingual CLIP in most experiments due to the better quality of the visual features. Our out-of-domain and zero-shot experiments show poor results and demonstrate that the Iconclass retrieval remains a challenging task. We make our source code and models publicly available to support heritage institutions in the further enrichment of their digital collections.","2023-06","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","","","2","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","natural language processing; deep learning; cultural heritage; transfer learning; Iconclass; multi-lingual retrieval; multi-modal retrieval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At the initial phase, the novel FDG-SKML relation extraction approach deploys a lexical-based mechanism that utilises a purposely built domain-specific Semantic Knowledge to encode the semantic association between the identified relations’ elements. The evaluation of the initial stage evidenced improved accuracy for extracting most complex Arabic relations. The initial relation extraction mechanism was further extended by integrating its output into a Machine Learning classifier that facilitated extracting especially complex relations with significant disparity in the relation elements’ presence, order, and correlation. Using Economics as the problem domain, experimental evaluation evidenced the high accuracy of our FDG-SKML approach in complex Arabic relation extraction task and demonstrated its further improvement upon integration with machine learning classifiers.","2023-08","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","","","8","22","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Natural Language Processing; Arabic relation extraction; Functional Discourse Grammar; hybrid knowledge-based machine learning classification; semantic web base","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

BPI requires the integration of business processes and their supporting systems across multiple autonomous organizations. However, such integration is complex and can face coordination complexities that occur during the resource exchanges between the partners’ processes. This article proposes a new method called Process Mining for Business Process Integration (PM4BPI) that helps process designers to perform BPI by creating new process models that cross the boundaries of multiple organizations from a collection of process event logs. PM4BPI uses federated process mining techniques to detect incompatibilities before the integration of the partners’ processes. Then, it applies process adaptation patterns to solve detected incompatibilities. Finally, organizations’ processes are merged to build a collaborative process model that crosses the organizations’ boundaries. AdaptWF_Net, an extension of a Petri net, is used to design inter-organizational business processes and adaptation patterns. An integrated care pathway is used as a case study to assess the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed method.","2024-03","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","","","1","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","process modelling; process mining; adaptation patterns; Business process integration; inter-organizational business process model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose a method based on improved label propagation to achieve automatic construction of Chinese sentiment lexicon from the sentence-level text. The key idea is to use lexical rules and sentiment association corrections to take the computational approach of optimizing mutual information of points, both of which improve the algorithm's effectiveness in analyzing complex sentences and thus enhance the accuracy of sentiment word recognition. The experimental results show that the method can automatically build a sentiment lexicon according to the corpus, with high quality and certain domain adaptability.","2022","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","1024–1029","","","","","","","EITCE '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xiamen, China","","","","Sentiment analysis; Domain sentiment lexicon; Label propagation; Pointwise mutual information; Public opinion analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, there is a need for investigating the efficiency during training and prediction of entity typing models in the ultrafine-grained setting, considering its distinctively bigger search space, compared to the coarse- and fine-grained tasks. To efficiently solve UFET, we propose Decent, a lightweight model that encodes, using a pretrained language model, the input sentences separately from the type labels. Additionally, we make use of negative oversampling to speed up the training while improving the generalization of unseen types. Using an openly available UFET dataset, we evaluated the classification and runtime performance of Decent and observed that training and prediction runtime is orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a competitive classification performance.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","205–214","","","","","","","JCDL '23","","","","IEEE Press","Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","named entity recognition; ultrafine enity typing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Paul Dourish proposed a way forward through the characterisation of embodied interactions in three senses: ontology, intersubjectivity, and intentionality. In a joint effort between computer and neuro-scientists, we built a framework to design studies that investigate multimodal embodied experiences in VR, and apply it to study the impact of simulated low-vision on user navigation. Our methodology involves the design of 3D scenarios annotated with an ontology, modelling intersubjective tasks, and correlating multimodal metrics such as gaze and physiology to derive intentions.

The knowledge graph completion model is mainly defined in three aspects, the way of negative example generation, the design of scoring function and the design of loss function. The previous knowledge graph completion models only rely on factual view data to predict the missing links between entities and ignore the valuable common sense knowledge, and there is invalid negative sampling in knowledge graph embedding techniques; on the other hand, the existing graph neural network-based knowledge graph embedding models mainly consider capturing the graph structure around entities, and the relational representation is only used to update the entity embedding, which may miss the potentially useful information about the relational structure of potentially useful information. To address the above challenges, this paper proposes a two-view graph neural network-based knowledge graph completion model combined with common sense awareness. Common knowledge is first automatically extracted from fact triples with entity concepts to facilitate high-quality negative sampling, and then positive and weighted negative triples are fed into the two-view graph neural network-based knowledge graph embedding model to capture entity- and relationship-centric graph structures and learn vector representations of entities and relationships, and then the learned entity and relationship representations are fed into a weighted score function to return the final the final score.

Our approach, EasyFR, streamlines the process by recommending Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) sequences for the given abstract features to guide Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) in producing cohesive FR statements. By analyzing ten diverse datasets, we induce two variable SRL templates, each including two configurable parts. For concrete features, our proposed Key2Temp model can construct the appropriate variant of the SRL template by identifying a variable SRL template and placing the feature tokens in the appropriate slots. In this way, our approach reframes the process of requirement generation into a structured slot-filling activity. Experimental validation on four open datasets demonstrates that EasyFR outperforms three advanced Natural language generation (NLG) approaches, including GPT-4, particularly when existing FRs are available for training. The positive influence of our SRL template variant recommendations is further confirmed through an ablation study.

However, recently reported data on fatal accidents involving ADSs suggests that the desired level of safety has not yet been fully achieved. Consequently, there is a growing need for more comprehensive and targeted testing approaches to ensure safe driving. Scenarios from real-world accident reports provide valuable resources for ADS testing, including critical scenarios and high-quality seeds. However, existing scenario reconstruction methods from accident reports often exhibit limited accuracy in information extraction. Moreover, due to the diversity and complexity of road environments, matching current accident information with the simulation map data for reconstruction poses significant challenges.In this paper, we design and implement SoVAR, a tool for automatically generating road-generalizable scenarios from accident reports. SoVAR utilizes well-designed prompts with linguistic patterns to guide the large language model (LLM) in extracting accident information from textual data. Subsequently, it formulates and solves accident-related constraints in conjunction with the extracted accident information to generate accident trajectories. Finally, SoVAR reconstructs accident scenarios on various map structures and converts them into test scenarios to evaluate its capability to detect defects in industrial ADSs. We experiment with SoVAR, using the accident reports from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's (NHTSA) database to generate test scenarios for the industrial-grade ADS Apollo. The experimental findings demonstrate that SoVAR can effectively generate generalized accident scenarios across different road structures. Furthermore, the results confirm that SoVAR identified 5 distinct safety violation types that contributed to the crash of Baidu Apollo.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:27","2025-09-10 14:12:27","","268–280","","","","","","","ASE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sacramento, CA, USA","","","","automatic test generation; autonomous driving system; constraint solving; software testing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, there may be a lack of motivation for developers to document design rationales (i.e., the design alternatives and the underlying arguments for making or rejecting decisions) when they will not gain immediate benefit, resulting in a lack of standard capture of these rationales. With the turnover of developers, the architecture inevitably becomes eroded. This issue has motivated a number of studies to extract design knowledge from open-source communities in recent years. Unfortunately, none of the existing research has successfully extracted solutions alone with their corresponding arguments due to challenges such as the intricate semantics of online discussions and the lack of benchmarks for design rationale extraction.In this paper, we propose a novel approach, named DRMiner, to automatically mine latent design rationales from developers' live discussion in open-source community (i.e., issue logs in Jira). To better identify solutions and their relevant arguments, DRMiner skillfully decomposes the problem into multiple text classification tasks and tackles them using prompt tuning of large language models (LLMs) and specific heuristic features. To evaluate DRMiner, we acquire issue logs from Cassandra, Flink, and Solr repositories in Jira and form a dataset for design rationale mining. Experimental results show that DRMiner outperforms all baselines and achieves F1 improvements of 24%, 22%, and 20% for mining design rationales, solutions, and arguments, respectively, compared to the best baseline. Furthermore, we investigate the usefulness of the design rationales mined by DRMiner for automated program repair (APR) and find that advanced LLMs, when prompted with these extracted rationales, generate 10×-18× more full-match patches and achieve a 10%-13% gain in CodeBLEU scores.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","468–480","","","","","","","ASE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Sacramento, CA, USA","","","","design discussion; design rationale; design recovery; issue logs; program maintenance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

RE covers human-related aspects, as stakeholders need to be involved in eliciting and validating the requirements, as well as more technical aspects, as requirements can be systematically collected (e.g., from app reviews) using data mining techniques and analyzed with natural language processing (NLP) approaches, e.g., to identify quality issues or trace links [2]. Despite the broad spectrum of activities that RE covers, researchers from outside RE often have a misconception that RE is limited to writing and analyzing requirements specifications. Consequently, many researchers in the SE community working on RE-relevant problems (e.g., human-centric SE) are often unaware that such problems belong to the RE research strands. Broadly speaking, RE is under-represented and under-appreciated in the SE community.Despite this limited presence, RE is more and more fundamental to cope with the current state of SE, especially considering the recent disruptive changes in artificial intelligence (AI) and NLP caused by large language models (LLMs) and their applications, ChatGPT being a notable example. Given the increasing pervasiveness of AI-based systems in our daily life, there is a growing need for RE techniques to support sound and structured development of AI systems [3], with a particular interest in explainability, interpretability, reliability, fairness, and other ethical concerns [4].

It is of no surprise that smart contract programming language technology constantly evolves to include not only specialized languages such as Solidity, but also general purpose languages such as GoLang and JavaScript. Furthermore, blockchain technology imposes unique challenges related to the monetary cost of deploying smart contracts, and handling roll-back issues when a smart contract fails. It is therefore evident that the complexity of systems involving smart contracts will only increase over time thus making the maintenance and evolution of such systems a very challenging task. One solution to these problems is to approach the implementation and deployment of such systems in a disciplined and automated way. In this paper, we propose a model-driven approach where the structure and inter-dependencies of smart contract, as well as stakeholder objectives, are denoted by extended goal models which can then be transformed to yield Solidity code that conforms with those models. More specifically, we present first a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to denote extended goal models and second, a transformation process which allows for the Abstract Syntax Trees of such a DSL program to be transformed into Solidity smart contact source code. The transformation process ensures that the generated smart contract skeleton code yields a system that is conformant with the model, which serves as a specification of said system so that subsequent analysis, understanding, and maintenance will be easier to achieve.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","112–121","","","","","","","ICSCA '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Kuantan, Malaysia","","","","Compliance; Code generation; Model-driven engineering; Smart contracts; Goal models; Modular Design","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we propose Variational Latent-State GPT model (VLS-GPT), which is the first to combine the strengths of the two approaches. Among many options of models, we propose the generative model and the inference model for variational learning of the end-to-end TOD system, both as auto-regressive language models based on GPT-2, which can be further trained over a mix of labeled and unlabeled dialog data in a semi-supervised manner. Variational training of VLS-GPT is both statistically and computationally more challenging than previous variational learning works for sequential latent variable models, which use turn-level first-order Markovian. The inference model in VLS-GPT is non-Markovian due to the use of the Transformer architecture. In this work, we establish Recursive Monte Carlo Approximation (RMCA) to the variational objective with non-Markovian inference model and prove its unbiasedness. Further, we develop the computational strategy of sampling-then-forward-computation to realize RMCA, which successfully overcomes the memory explosion issue of using GPT in variational learning and speeds up training. Semi-supervised TOD experiments are conducted on two benchmark multi-domain datasets of different languages - MultiWOZ2.1 and CrossWOZ. VLS-GPT is shown to significantly outperform both supervised-only and semi-supervised self-training baselines.","2023-01","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","970–984","","","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ontologies such as Brick, IFC, SSN/SOSA, and SAREF have been created to describe the technical systems in a machine-understandable manner. However, such ontologies focus largely on describing system topology, whereas several use cases, such as automated fault detection and diagnostics (AFDD), also need knowledge about the physical processes. Physical processes can be described using mathematical simulation models, but this is practically too expensive for building automation systems and their integration with mainstream technical systems ontologies is still under-explored. We propose to address these challenges by introducing the concept of component stereotypes that describe the effect of component actuation on the state its underlying physical mechanism. These stereotypes are then linked to actual component instances in the technical system description, thereby accomplishing an integration of structural description with knowledge about physical processes. We contribute an ontology for such stereotypes and evaluate it with respect to the coverage of HVAC components in Brick and its ability to automatically infer relationships between components in a real-world building. We show how the resulting knowledge graph can be queried by AFDD applications to know about expected consequences of an action, or conversely, identify components that may be responsible for an observed state of the process. While we are able to report a coverage of 100% of Brick HVAC components, the automatic inference underreports component dependencies in real-world installations. This points at a group of concepts which we propose should be considered in future versions of the Brick ontology.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","120–129","","","","","","","BuildSys '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Istanbul, Turkey","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In biomedical information science, recognizing entities (e.g., genes, diseases, or drugs) and normalizing them to concepts in standard terminologies or thesauri (e.g., Entrez, ICD-10, or RxNorm) is crucial for identifying more informative relations among them that drive disease etiology, progression, and treatment. In this effort we pursue two high level strategies to improve biomedical ER and EN. The first is to decouple standard entity encoding tags (e.g., ""B-Drug"" for the beginning of a drug) into type tags (e.g., ""Drug"") and positional tags (e.g., ""B""). A second strategy is to use additional counterfactual training examples to handle the issue of models learning spurious correlations between surrounding context and normalized concepts in training data. We conduct elaborate experiments using the MedMentions dataset, the largest dataset of its kind for ER and EN in biomedicine. We find that our first strategy performs better in entity normalization when compared with the standard coding scheme. The second data augmentation strategy uniformly improves performance in span detection, typing, and normalization. The gains from counterfactual examples are more prominent when evaluating in zero-shot settings, for concepts that have never been encountered during training.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","","","","","","","","BCB '21","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Gainesville, Florida","","","","named entity recognition; entity normalization; biomedical natural language processing; information extraction; deep neural networks","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Mach. Learn. Res.","","1532-4435","","","Machine learning (ML) systems often exhibit unexpectedly poor behavior when they are deployed in real-world domains. We identify underspecification in ML pipelines as a key reason for these failures. An ML pipeline is the full procedure followed to train and validate a predictor. Such a pipeline is underspecified when it can return many distinct predictors with equivalently strong test performance. Underspecification is common in modern ML pipelines that primarily validate predictors on held-out data that follow the same distribution as the training data. Predictors returned by underspecified pipelines are often treated as equivalent based on their training domain performance, but we show here that such predictors can behave very differently in deployment domains. This ambiguity can lead to instability and poor model behavior in practice, and is a distinct failure mode from previously identified issues arising from structural mismatch between training and deployment domains. We provide evidence that underspecfication has substantive implications for practical ML pipelines, using examples from computer vision, medical imaging, natural language processing, clinical risk prediction based on electronic health records, and medical genomics. Our results show the need to explicitly account for underspecification in modeling pipelines that are intended for real-world deployment in any domain.","2022-01","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","","","1","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: JMLR.org","","","","natural language processing; electronic health records; genomics; fairness; computer vision; distribution shift; identifiability; medical imaging; spurious correlation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach can create complex training content similar to advanced attack campaigns, which passes evaluation for soundness and practicality. Our proposed approach and its implementation significantly contribute to the state of the art, enabling novel approaches to cybersecurity training and autonomous system development.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","","","","","","","","ARES '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Vienna, Austria","","","","adversary framework; attack scenario generation; cyber terrain generation; cybersecurity model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose a collaborative systems thinking approach as a scoping tool for co-design, enabling researchers and designers to involve people in co-creating an understanding of the systemic structures underpinning DG in cities and developing prototypes and solutions informed by these structures. Using causal loop diagrams, we facilitated the development of a conceptual model of DG. Participants, representing diverse perspectives, created individual causal loop diagrams that were merged into a collaborative causal loop diagram (C-CLD). This C-CLD was employed in an interactive workshop to identify intervention points and develop targeted solutions. Our findings demonstrate how C-CLDs can accommodate multiplicity, foster agonism, and enable participants to challenge political dimensions and existing systemic structures. Moreover, the engagement process revealed the complexity of DG in the city, as perceived by the collective of participants, resulting in three key submodules that highlight tensions between citizen sensitisation to data collection, the private sector’s role in fulfilling citizens’ needs, and the struggles faced by local governments. This work draws on and extends HCI research that engages with systems thinking ontologies, contributing to an HCI that includes the political, moves beyond solutionism, and advances social justice-oriented approaches.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","48–67","","","","","","","COMPASS '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Systems thinking; Co-design; Cities; Causal loop diagram; Data governance","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Fortunately, formal methods have advanced to the point that they can address such needs and contribute towards achieving security certification. However, new methods and tools focusing on industrial scalability and usability for systems engineers are required. In this ongoing research paper, we describe a framework that will help systems engineers to: a) design cyber-assured CPS using a Model Based Engineering (MBE) approach; b) formally map security requirements to different hardware and software blocks in the model; and c) formally verify security requirements.

More recently, there has been a proposal to develop a role for philosophical inquiry in Computing Education, which mirrors similar historical developments in Engineering Education. Rather than focus on the quantitative or qualitative analysis of the student experience, philosophical investigation instead relies on the use of conceptual analysis to investigate the detailed semantic content of ideas raised in the practice of computing education, careful analysis of the methodologies used to do such work, and a critique of the assumptions that underlie the subject.In this paper, we investigate ways in which an understanding of the Philosophy of Computing Education can assist research within the subject.

After two years of control efforts, life gradually returned to the pre-pandemic state, but localized outbreaks continued to occur. Toward the end of 2022, COVID-19 resurged in China, leading to another disruption of people’s lives and work. Many pieces of information on social media reflected people’s views and emotions toward the second outbreak, which showed distinct differences compared to the first outbreak in 2020. To explore people’s emotional attitudes toward the pandemic at different stages and the underlying reasons, this study collected microblog data from November 2022 to January 2023 and from January to June 2020, encompassing Chinese reactions to the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on hesitancy and the Fuzzy Intuition theory, we proposed a hypothesis: hesitancy can be integrated into machine learning models to select suitable corpora for training, which not only improves accuracy but also enhances model efficiency. Based on this hypothesis, we designed a hesitancy-integrated model. The experimental results demonstrated the model’s positive performance on a self-constructed database. By applying this model to analyze people’s attitudes toward the pandemic, we obtained their sentiments in different months. We found that the most negative emotions appeared at the beginning of the pandemic, followed by emotional fluctuations influenced by social events, ultimately showing an overall positive trend. Combining word cloud techniques and the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) model effectively helped explore the reasons behind the changes in pandemic attitude.","2024-04","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","","","4","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","machine learning; COVID-19; sentiment analysis; fuzzy intuition theory; hesitancy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People are accustomed to using informal and dynamic language on the internet to express their preferences and expectations. In order to obtain actionable insights from large-scale textual data, it is necessary to employ natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful patterns and trends. Therefore, the study introduced TF-IDF analysis and Topic Modeling for textual data analysis. At the same time, the study introduced TF-IDF analysis and Topic Modeling for identifying key branding themes and introduced a knowledge-based system combining rule-based decision-making models and ontological frameworks based on branding domain knowledge, thereby constructing a comprehensive branding framework. The innovation of the research lies in the synergistic combination of traditional frequency-based analysis and coherence-driven topic modeling feature weight calculation methods with knowledge-based systems to formulate adaptive branding strategies, thereby improving the efficiency and precision of branding methodologies. The outcomes indicated that the accuracy of the classification model combining Topic Modeling and TF-IDF based on educational branding datasets was 94%, the coherence score was as high as 0.724, and the term frequency recall was 89%. Meanwhile, the classification error rate of the model was only 6%. In addition, the proposed branding system, which adopted a knowledge-driven framework, had an average of 2,500 daily visits per person, with an effective browsing time of 12 minutes per person, and a daily browsing page count of 15 pages per person. This indicates that the knowledge-based branding framework has strong practical application effects and provides reliable technical support for current research in the field of educational branding.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","1–7","","","","","","","ICFNDS '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These semantic entities are embedded in a knowledge graph, allowing integration of information from disparate sources under common semantic definitions across spatial and temporal dimensions. Multiple research efforts have contributed to recovering semantics of numeric columns in tables, however they are either restricted to a single domain or rely on the existence of numeric data as linked data tuples in known ontologies. We present a novel yet simple approach using a supervised machine learning classifier (Random Forests) and semantic web techniques to generate semantics for numeric columns in tabular data.

Firms’ public disclosures (e.g., 10-K reports, earnings conference calls) are a key source of data to learn about digital risks. Although text analytics approaches (e.g., word frequency, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis) have been applied to a firm's public disclosures to assess various types of risk (e.g., political risk, tax risk, cybersecurity), they do not consider the structural linguistic relations embedded in the text that are potentially relevant in measuring risk.We apply a neural network approach to address this gap and extract linguistic relations from a firm's 10-K disclosure (Section “Item 1A”). We develop novel firm-level digital risk measures based on these linguistic relations. Specifically, we measure firm-level digital risk from three perspectives: (1) presence (whether digital risk is mentioned or not), (2) intensity (text coverage of digital risk relative to other issues), and (3) diversity (the types of digital risk mentioned).We validate our digital risk measures by demonstrating their significant correlation with firm risk, proxied by stock market volatility. Our research reveals that investors’ perceptions of digital risk diversity and digital risk intensity differ between IT and non-IT companies. First, across all firms, digital risk intensity is negatively associated with firm risk, indicating that investors do not incorporate intensity of digital risk when assessing firm risk. Second, in non-IT firms, digital risk diversity is positively associated with firm risk, suggesting that managers in these firms may influence investor perceptions through strategic disclosure of digital risk types. Overall, our findings suggest that text-based digital risk measurement is practically feasible, scalable, and economically meaningful.","2025-05","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","","","3","16","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Deep learning; Textual analysis; Corporate disclosure; Digital risk; Linguistic structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, motion notation approaches are not widespread, the process is often time-consuming, and the movements are hard to visualize without expert knowledge. In this work, we use Labanotation and Laban Movement Analysis (LMA), a notation system and method originally developed for dance, as a symbolic, interpretable framework for motion representation and preservation. Our contribution resides in the expansion of an existing annotation system, the LabanEditor, to handle full-body motion and data from multiple sources, and support the work of experts in annotating the movements. Our development, called MoR℡aban, supports motion-to-notation and inverse mapping from notation to keyframes, enabling exchange between video, motion capture, and Labanotation formats. This allows for the documentation and reconstruction of traditional motion practices using expert-readable scores and 3D skeletons.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","459–463","","","","","","","UMAP Adjunct '25","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","knowledge representation; expert systems; Labanotation; motion modeling; movement modeling; Laban Movement Analysis (LMA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With the rapid development of deep learning, deep clustering has achieved significant advantages over traditional clustering methods. Despite the effectiveness, most existing deep text clustering methods rely heavily on representations pre-trained in general domains, which may not be the most suitable solution for clustering in specific target domains. To address this issue, we propose CEIL, a novel Classification-Enhanced Iterative Learning framework for short text clustering, which aims at generally promoting the clustering performance by introducing a classification objective to iteratively improve feature representations. In each iteration, we first adopt a language model to retrieve the initial text representations, from which the clustering results are collected using our proposed Category Disentangled Contrastive Clustering (CDCC) algorithm. After strict data filtering and aggregation processes, samples with clean category labels are retrieved, which serve as supervision information to update the language model with the classification objective via a prompt learning approach. Finally, the updated language model with improved representation ability is used to enhance clustering in the next iteration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the CEIL framework significantly improves the clustering performance over iterations, and is generally effective on various clustering algorithms. Moreover, by incorporating CEIL on CDCC, we achieve the state-of-the-art clustering performance on a wide range of short text clustering benchmarks outperforming other strong baseline methods.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","1784–1792","","","","","","","WWW '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Austin, TX, USA","","","","Classification-enhanced Clustering; Iterative Framework; Text Clustering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, these interfaces often fail to interpret more complex analytical intents, such as discerning subtleties and quantifiable differences between terms like “bump’’ and “spike’’ in the context of COVID cases, for example. We address this gap by extending the capabilities of a data exploration search interface for interpreting semantic concepts in time series trends. We first create a comprehensive dataset of semantic concepts by mapping quantifiable univariate data trends such as slope and angle to crowdsourced, semantically meaningful trend labels. The dataset contains quantifiable properties that capture the slope-scalar effect of semantic modifiers like “sharply” and “gradually,” as well as multi-line trends (e.g., “peak,” “valley”). We demonstrate the utility of this dataset in SlopeSeeker, a tool that supports natural language querying of quantifiable trends, such as “show me stocks that tanked in 2010.” The tool incorporates novel scoring and ranking techniques based on semantic relevance and visual prominence to present relevant trend chart responses containing these semantic trend concepts. In addition, SlopeSeeker provides a faceted search interface for users to navigate a semantic hierarchy of concepts from general trends (e.g., “increase’’) to more specific ones (e.g., “sharp increase’’). A preliminary user evaluation of the tool demonstrates that the search interface supports greater expressivity of queries containing concepts that describe data trends. We identify potential future directions for leveraging our publicly available quantitative semantics dataset in other data domains and for novel visual analytics interfaces.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:28","2025-09-10 14:12:28","","817–836","","","","","","","IUI '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Greenville, SC, USA","","","","Semantics; search; quantifiable metadata; trends; visual analysis.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finding the roles of event arguments like event participants is essential for event extraction. However, doing so for real-life event descriptions is challenging because an argument’s role often varies in different contexts. While the relationship and interactions between multiple arguments are useful for settling the argument roles, such information is largely ignored by existing approaches. This paper presents a better approach for event extraction by explicitly utilizing the relationships of event arguments. We achieve this through a carefully designed task-oriented dialogue system. To model the argument relation, we employ reinforcement learning and incremental learning to extract multiple arguments via a multi-turned, iterative process. Our approach leverages knowledge of the already extracted arguments of the same sentence to determine the role of arguments that would be difficult to decide individually. It then uses the newly obtained information to improve the decisions of previously extracted arguments. This two-way feedback process allows us to exploit the argument relations to effectively settle argument roles, leading to better sentence understanding and event extraction. Experimental results show that our approach consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art event extraction methods for the classification of events and argument role and argument identification.","2022-12","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","520–533","","","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE Press","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This survey article traces the evolution of such methods beginning from traditional NLP techniques such as kernel-based methods to the most recent research work on transformer-based models, categorizing them based on their underlying principles as knowledge-based, corpus-based, deep neural network–based methods, and hybrid methods. Discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each method, this survey provides a comprehensive view of existing systems in place for new researchers to experiment and develop innovative ideas to address the issue of semantic similarity.","2021-02","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","","","2","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","Semantic similarity; word embeddings; linguistics; corpus-based methods; knowledge-based methods; supervised and unsupervised methods","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For the purposes of developing an AI speech emotion recognition (SER) system, however, emotion must be defined, bounded, and instantiated as ground truth in the training data. This means practical choices must be made in which particular emotional ontologies are prioritized over others in the construction of SER datasets. In this paper, I explore these tensions around fairness, accountability, and transparency by analyzing open-source datasets used for SER applications along with their accompanying methodology papers. Specifically, I critique the centrality of discrete emotion theory in SER applications as a contestable emotional framework that is invoked primarily for its practical utility and alignment – as opposed to scientific rigor – with machine learning epistemologies. In so doing, I also shed light on the role of the dataset creators as emotional designers in their attempt to produce, elicit, record, and index emotional expressions for the purposes of crafting SER training datasets. Ultimately, by further querying SER through the aperture of Critical Disability Studies, I use this empirical work to examine the sociopolitical stakes of SER as a normative and regulatory technology that siphons emotion into a broader agenda of capitalistic productivity in the context of call center optimization.","2023","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","455–466","","","","","","","FAccT '23","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Chicago, IL, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By understanding this process, designers and educators are better able to support and guide collaborative learning activities. This paper presents an application of our Lifespan of an Idea framework to measure engagement patterns among individuals in communal socio-technical spaces like Twitter. We correlated engagement with social participation, enabling the process of idea expression, spread, and evolution. Social participation leads to transmission of ideas from one individual to another and can be gauged in the same way as evaluating diseases. The temporal dynamics of the social participation can be modeled through the lens of epidemiological modeling. To test the plausibility of this framework, we investigated social participation on Twitter using the tweet posting patterns of individuals in three academic conferences and one long term chat space. We used a basic SIR epidemiological model, where the rate parameters were estimated through Euler's solutions to SIR model and non-linear least squares optimization technique. We discuss the differences in the social participation among individuals in these spaces based on their transition behavior into different categories of the SIR model. We also made inferences on how the total lifetime of these different twitter spaces affects the engagement among individuals. We conclude by discussing implications of this study and planned future research of refining the Lifespan of an Idea Framework.","2020","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","197–202","","","","","","","LAK '20","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Frankfurt, Germany","","","","epidemiology; connectivism; engagement patterns; ideas; knowledge creation; networked learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aspects of products provide a fine-grained meaningful perspective for understanding and organizing review texts. Traditional aspect term extraction approaches rely on discrete language models that treat words in isolation. Despite that continuous-space language models have demonstrated promise in addressing a wide range of problems, their application in aspect term extraction faces significant challenges. For instance, existing continuous-space language models typically require large collections of labeled data, which remain difficult to obtain in many domains. More importantly, previous methods are largely data driven but overlook the role of human knowledge in guiding model development. To address these limitations, this study designs and develops weakly supervised WordNet-guided deep learning to aspect term extraction. The approach draws on deep-level semantic information from WordNet to guide not only the selection representative seed terms but also the pruning of aspect candidate terms. The weak supervision is provided by a very small set of labeled data. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method using both direct and indirect methods. The evaluation results with Yelp restaurant reviews demonstrate that our proposed method consistently outperforms all baseline methods including discrete models and the state-of-the-art continuous-space language models for aspect term extraction across both direct and indirect evaluations.

The shift towards decentralized personal online datastores (pods) and Solid 2 principles represents a new era of private, controllable Web interactions, balancing AI data protection and machine intelligence. This balance is particularly important for applications involving health data. However, decentralization poses challenges, particularly in secure, efficient data search and data retrieval, that need to be addressed first. We argue that a decentralized search system that provides a large-scale search across Solid pods, while considering data owners' control of their data and users' different access rights, is crucial for this new paradigm.

While the requirement to treat these standard situations idiomatically seems to be broadly accepted, I argue that its alternative, letting expressions evaluate to any number of objects directly, has several advantages that make it worthy of consideration. As a proof of concept, I present a core object-oriented programming language, dubbed Num, which separates number from type so that the type of an expression is independent of the number of objects it may evaluate to, thus removing one major obstacle to using no, one, and many objects uniformly. Furthermore, Num abandons null references, replaces the nullability of reference types with the more general notion of countability, and allows methods to be invoked on any number of objects, including no object. To be able to adapt behavior to the actual number of receivers, Num complements instance methods with plural methods, that is, with methods that operate on a number of objects jointly and that replace static methods known from other languages. An implementation of Num in Prolog and accompanying type and number safety proofs are presented.","2022-09","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","","","4","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: New York, NY, USA Publisher: Association for Computing Machinery","","","","bunches; collections; Multiplicities in programming; null-safety; object-relational programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Relation Hallucination refers to the generation of summary sentences that imply or state relationships between entities or events that were not present or implied in the original document. Relation Hallucination is a pivotal concern in abstractive text summarization, where models fabricate or exaggerate connections, leading to misleading summaries. This paper delves deep into the evaluation of Relation Hallucination in abstractive summarization. We introduce a novel metric, the Relation Hallucination Index, designed to evaluate and quantify Relation hallucinations across various state-of-the-art models. Emphasizing the paramount importance of maintaining accurate relational context in summaries, this article showcases the efficacy of the Relation hallucination index in discerning fabricated relationships. The Relation hallucination index provides a quantitative measure of the various levels of Relation Hallucination present in generated summaries, enabling practitioners from industry as well as Academia to select models aligned with desired hallucination parameters for their tailored applications.","2025","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","88–94","","","","","","","FIRE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","Abstractive summarization; Hallucination; Extractiveness Factor; Lost Focus; Negative Hallucination; Over Focus; Positive Hallucination; Relation Tuples","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given a natural language query and a few labeled webpages, our method synthesizes a program that can be used to extract similar types of information from other unlabeled webpages. To handle websites with diverse structure, our approach employs a neurosymbolic DSL that incorporates both neural NLP models as well as standard language constructs for tree navigation and string manipulation. We also propose an optimal synthesis algorithm that generates all DSL programs that achieve optimal F1 score on the training examples. Our synthesis technique is compositional, prunes the search space by exploiting a monotonicity property of the DSL, and uses transductive learning to select programs with good generalization power. We have implemented these ideas in a new tool called WebQA and evaluate it on 25 different tasks across multiple domains. Our experiments show that WebQA significantly outperforms existing tools such as state-of-the-art question answering models and wrapper induction systems.","2021","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","328–343","","","","","","","PLDI 2021","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Virtual, Canada","","","","Program Synthesis; Programming by Example; Web Information Extraction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Firstly, an ontology library was constructed according to the characteristics of mine electromechanical equipment, Word2Vec was used to obtain the vector representation of characters and words, and the term words were obtained by matching in the ontology library. The multi-term multi-head attention mechanism was used to assign larger weights to these term words and then they were fused with the character vector. Then, the Bi-LSTM model was used for feature extraction, and a contrastive learning strategy based on R-drop was used to reduce the recognition bias error caused by the similarity of entity names. We also improved the loss function by using the relative entropy loss calculated by the Bi-LSTM layer as the regularization term of the loss in the CRF layer to form a constraint on the loss function and enhance the robustness of the model to Dropout. Finally, we used the CRF model to decode to obtain the optimal label. Experimental results show that compared with the existing mainstream baseline method Lattice-LSTM, our proposed method achieves better results on the self-constructed mine electromechanical equipment corpus. The precision, recall and F1 value are improved by 4.73, 5.5 and 5.09 percentage points, respectively.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","660–664","","","","","","","CAICE '24","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Xi' an, China","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We used the word embedding method to transform every word in the dataset and to obtain the custom-built word embedding vectors. This is in contrast to the approaches in the previous literature that implement word embedding using the pre-trained word embedding vectors. We enriched the custom-built word embedding vectors by incorporating Part-of-Speech (POS) tag vectors to provide additional semantic information about the word to be used in training our proposed classification model. The proposed model was built using the neural network approach, which is considered to be more efficient and reliable in solving real problems for document classification tasks. We fine-tuned the parameters during the training of our neural network classification model with our aim to increase the performance in terms of classification accuracy. The experimental result demonstrates that our model performs remarkably well and increase the percentage accuracy up to 1.7% compared to the accuracy results obtained by the previous baseline word embedding methods using the same dataset. It was also observed that our model outperforms some other traditional classification models implemented using different techniques and machine learning algorithms.","2019","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","42–46","","","","","","","ICCBD '19","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","","","event-place: Taichung, Taiwan","","","","Natural Language Processing; Word Embeddings; Document Classification","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When modeling and simulating complex systems and real data are sparse, stylized facts have become a key instrument for building trust in a model as they represent important requirements regarding the model's behavior. However, automatically validating stylized facts has remained limited as they are usually expressed in natural language. Therefore, we develop a formal language with a custom syntax and tailored predicates allowing modelers to unambiguously and succinctly describe important (temporal) characteristics of simulation traces or relationships between multiple traces via statistical tests. The proposed formal language is able to express numerous facts from the literature in different application domains, as well as to automatically check stylized facts. If stylized facts are defined at the beginning of a simulation study, formally expressing and checking them can streamline and guide the development of simulation models and their successive revisions.","2024","2025-09-10 14:12:29","2025-09-10 14:12:29","","2674–2685","","","","","","","WSC '23","","","","IEEE Press","San Antonio, Texas, USA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
