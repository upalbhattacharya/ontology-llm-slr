Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs and ontologies represent entities and their relationships in
a structured way, having gained significance in the development of modern AI
applications. Integrating these semantic resources with machine learning models
often relies on knowledge graph embedding models to transform graph data into
numerical representations. Therefore, pre-trained models for popular knowledge
graphs and ontologies are increasingly valuable, as they spare the need to
retrain models for different tasks using the same data, thereby helping to
democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,
designed to generate and serve knowledge graph embeddings for widely used
biomedical ontologies. Given the dynamic nature of these ontologies,
Bio-KGvec2go also supports regular updates aligned with ontology version
releases. By offering up-to-date embeddings with minimal computational effort
required from users, Bio-KGvec2go facilitates efficient and timely biomedical
research.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Scientific literature is growing exponentially, creating a critical
bottleneck for researchers to efficiently synthesize knowledge. While
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) show potential in text processing,
they often fail to capture scientific domain-specific nuances (e.g., technical
jargon, methodological rigor) and struggle with complex scientific tasks,
limiting their utility for interdisciplinary research. To address these gaps,
this paper presents SciGPT, a domain-adapted foundation model for scientific
literature understanding and ScienceBench, an open source benchmark tailored to
evaluate scientific LLMs.
  Built on the Qwen3 architecture, SciGPT incorporates three key innovations:
(1) low-cost domain distillation via a two-stage pipeline to balance
performance and efficiency; (2) a Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) attention
mechanism that cuts memory consumption by 55\% for 32,000-token long-document
reasoning; and (3) knowledge-aware adaptation integrating domain ontologies to
bridge interdisciplinary knowledge gaps.
  Experimental results on ScienceBench show that SciGPT outperforms GPT-4o in
core scientific tasks including sequence labeling, generation, and inference.
It also exhibits strong robustness in unseen scientific tasks, validating its
potential to facilitate AI-augmented scientific discovery.},

Abstract      = {The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but

The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.},

Abstract      = {The linking of clinical entities is a crucial part of extracting structured

ICD-10 codes in different languages using Large Language Models (LLMs). The
approach consists of a multistage pipeline that uses clinical dictionaries to
match unambiguous terms in the text and then applies in-context learning with
GPT-4.1 to predict the ICD-10 code for the terms that do not match the
dictionary. Our system shows promising results in predicting ICD-10 codes on

Abstract      = {Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.},

language. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within
the programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the
application domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic
lifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain
the operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and
virtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection
layer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case
study of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the
technique. The language implementation is open source and available online.},

Abstract      = {Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical

facilitate hypothesis development and stimulate scientific debate, the present
article offers the first theoretical framework of the processes of change in
psychotherapy delivered by artificial agents. The theoretical framework rests
upon a conceptual analysis of what active ingredients may be inherently linked
to the presence of human therapists. We propose that human therapists'
ontological status as human beings and sociocultural status as socially
sanctioned healthcare professionals play crucial roles in promoting treatment
outcomes. In the absence of the ontological and sociocultural status of human
therapists, we propose what we coin the genuineness gap and credibility gap can
emerge and undermine key processes of change in psychotherapy. Based on these
propositions, we propose avenues for scientific investigations and practical
applications aimed at leveraging the strengths of artificial agents and human
therapists respectively. We also highlight the intricate agentic nature of
artificial agents and discuss how this complicates endeavors to establish
universally applicable propositions regarding the processes of change in these

Abstract      = {A Chief complaint (CC) is the reason for the medical visit as stated in the

methods, resulting in a wide variation of medical notations, which makes it
difficult to standardize across different medical institutions for record

automatically extract and link entities in chief complaints in the absence of
human annotation. We first adopt a split-and-match algorithm to produce weak
annotations, including entity mention spans and class labels, on 1.2 million
real-world de-identified and IRB approved chief complaint records. Then we
train a BERT-based model with generated weak labels to locate entity mentions

Abstract      = {Legal reasoning requires both precise interpretation of statutory language
and consistent application of complex rules, presenting significant challenges
for AI systems. This paper introduces a modular multi-agent framework that
decomposes legal reasoning into distinct knowledge acquisition and application
stages. In the first stage, specialized agents extract legal concepts and
formalize rules to create verifiable intermediate representations of statutes.
The second stage applies this knowledge to specific cases through three steps:
analyzing queries to map case facts onto the ontology schema, performing
symbolic inference to derive logically entailed conclusions, and generating
final answers using a programmatic implementation that operationalizes the
ontological knowledge. This bridging of natural language understanding with
symbolic reasoning provides explicit and verifiable inspection points,
significantly enhancing transparency compared to end-to-end approaches.
Evaluation on statutory tax calculation tasks demonstrates substantial
improvements, with foundational models achieving 76.4\% accuracy compared to
18.8\% baseline performance, effectively narrowing the performance gap between
reasoning and foundational models. These findings suggest that modular
architectures with formalized knowledge representations can make sophisticated
legal reasoning more accessible through computationally efficient models while
enhancing consistency and explainability in AI legal reasoning, establishing a
foundation for future research into more transparent, trustworthy, and
effective AI systems for legal domain.},

Abstract      = {Medical ontology graphs map external knowledge to medical codes in electronic
health records via structured relationships. By leveraging domain-approved
connections (e.g., parent-child), predictive models can generate richer medical
concept representations by incorporating contextual information from related
concepts. However, existing literature primarily focuses on incorporating
domain knowledge from a single ontology system, or from multiple ontology
systems (e.g., diseases, drugs, and procedures) in isolation, without
integrating them into a unified learning structure. Consequently, concept
representation learning often remains limited to intra-ontology relationships,
overlooking cross-ontology connections. In this paper, we propose LINKO, a
large language model (LLM)-augmented integrative ontology learning framework
that leverages multiple ontology graphs simultaneously by enabling dual-axis
knowledge propagation both within and across heterogeneous ontology systems to
enhance medical concept representation learning. Specifically, LINKO first
employs LLMs to provide a graph-retrieval-augmented initialization for ontology
concept embedding, through an engineered prompt that includes concept
descriptions, and is further augmented with ontology context. Second, our
method jointly learns the medical concepts in diverse ontology graphs by
performing knowledge propagation in two axes: (1) intra-ontology vertical
propagation across hierarchical ontology levels and (2) inter-ontology
horizontal propagation within every level in parallel. Last, through extensive
experiments on two public datasets, we validate the superior performance of
LINKO over state-of-the-art baselines. As a plug-in encoder compatible with
existing EHR predictive models, LINKO further demonstrates enhanced robustness
in scenarios involving limited data availability and rare disease prediction.},

domains: biomedicine, physics, and engineering. The models were evaluated under
three distinct conditions: zero-shot prompting, chain-of-thought prompting, and
fine-tuning on existing ontologies. Additionally, we assessed the cross-domain
transferability of fine-tuned models by measuring their performance when
trained in one domain and subsequently applied to a different one. To support
this analysis, we introduce PEM-Rel-8K, a novel dataset consisting of over
8,000 relationships extracted from the most widely adopted taxonomies in the

Abstract      = {Retrieval-augmented learning based on radiology reports has emerged as a
promising direction to improve performance on long-tail medical imaging tasks,
such as rare disease detection in chest X-rays. Most existing methods rely on
comparing high-dimensional text embeddings from models like CLIP or CXR-BERT,
which are often difficult to interpret, computationally expensive, and not
well-aligned with the structured nature of medical knowledge. We propose a
novel, ontology-driven alternative for comparing radiology report texts based
on clinically grounded concepts from the Unified Medical Language System
(UMLS). Our method extracts standardised medical entities from free-text
reports using an enhanced pipeline built on RadGraph-XL and SapBERT. These
entities are linked to UMLS concepts (CUIs), enabling a transparent,
interpretable set-based representation of each report. We then define a
task-adaptive similarity measure based on a modified and weighted version of
the Tversky Index that accounts for synonymy, negation, and hierarchical
relationships between medical entities. This allows efficient and semantically
meaningful similarity comparisons between reports. We demonstrate that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-art embedding-based retrieval methods in a
radiograph classification task on MIMIC-CXR, particularly in long-tail
settings. Additionally, we use our pipeline to generate ontology-backed disease
labels for MIMIC-CXR, offering a valuable new resource for downstream learning
tasks. Our work provides more explainable, reliable, and task-specific

improves overall performance through lexical augmentation Task B, which
involves assigning types to given terms, is handled via a dual strategy. In the
few-shot setting (for domains with labeled training data), we reuse the RAG
scheme with few-shot prompting. In the zero-shot setting (for previously unseen
domains), we use a zero-shot classifier that combines cosine similarity scores
from multiple embedding models using confidence-based weighting. In Task C, we
model taxonomy discovery as graph inference. Using embeddings of type labels,
we train a lightweight cross-attention layer to predict is-a relations by
approximating a soft adjacency matrix. These modular, task-specific solutions

Abstract      = {One of the enduring challenges in education is how to empower students to
take ownership of their learning by setting meaningful goals, tracking their
progress, and adapting their strategies when faced with setbacks. Research has
shown that this form of leaner-centered learning is best cultivated through
structured, supportive environments that promote guided practice, scaffolded
inquiry, and collaborative dialogue. In response, educational efforts have
increasingly embraced artificial-intelligence (AI)-powered digital learning
environments, ranging from educational apps and virtual labs to serious games.
Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and neuro-symbolic systems,
meanwhile, offer a transformative opportunity to reimagine how support is
delivered in digital learning environments. LLMs are enabling socially
interactive learning experiences and scalable, cross-domain learning support
that can adapt instructional strategies across varied subjects and contexts. In
parallel, neuro-symbolic AI provides new avenues for designing these agents
that are not only adaptive but also scalable across domains. Based on these
remarks, this paper presents a multi-agent, neuro-symbolic framework designed
to resolve the aforementioned challenges. The framework assigns distinct
pedagogical roles to specialized agents: an RL-based 'tutor' agent provides
authoritative, non-verbal scaffolding, while a proactive, LLM-powered 'peer'
agent facilitates the social dimensions of learning. While prior work has
explored such agents in isolation, our framework's novelty lies in unifying
them through a central educational ontology. Through case studies in both
college-level and middle school settings, we demonstrate the framework's
adaptability across domains. We conclude by outlining key insights and future

to legal provisions, and links facts, norms, and legal applications through an
ontology of legal inference. The resulting graph captures the full structure of
legal reasoning as it appears in real court decisions, making implicit
reasoning explicit and machine-readable. We evaluate our system using expert
annotated data, and find that it achieves more accurate retrieval of relevant
legal provisions from facts than large language model baselines and

Abstract      = {Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.},

Abstract      = {In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.},

Abstract      = {The Smart City concept was introduced to define an idealized city
characterized by automation and connection. It then evolved rapidly by
including further aspects, such as economy, environment. Since then, many
publications have explored various aspects of Smart Cities across different
application domains and research communities, acknowledging the
interdisciplinary nature of this subject. In particular, our interest focuses
on how smart cities are designed and modeled, as a whole or as regards with
their subsystems, when dealing with the accomplishment of the research goals in
this complex and heterogeneous domain. To this aim, we performed a systematic
mapping study on smart cities modeling approaches identifying the relevant
contributions (i) to get an overview of existing research approaches, (ii) to
identify whether there are any publication trends, and (iii) to identify
possible future research directions. We followed the guidelines for conducting
systematic mapping studies by Petersen et al. to analyze smart cities modeling
publications. Our analysis revealed the following main findings: (i) smart
governance is the most investigated and modeled smart city dimension; (ii) the
most used modeling approaches are business, architectural, and ontological
modeling approaches, spanning multiple application fields; (iii) the great
majority of existing technologies for modeling smart cities are not yet proven
in operational environments; (iv) diverse research communities publish their
results in a multitude of different venues which further motivates the
presented literature study. Researchers can use our results for better
understanding the state-of-the-art in modeling smart cities, and as a
foundation for further analysis of specific approaches about smart cities
modeling. Lastly, we also discuss the impact of our analysis for the

Abstract      = {The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should

gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG[.]in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we
have been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of

integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more

paper proposes a novel approach -- Representation Disentanglement -- to
disentangle these multiple layers of knowledge representation complexity
hindering effective reengineering decision making. The approach is based on the
theoretically grounded and implementationally robust ontology-driven conceptual

obstacle, we have developed a large language model (LLM)-based metadata
harvester that flexibly extracts metadata from any dataset's landing page, and
converts these to a user-defined, unified format using existing metadata
standards. We validate that our tool is able to extract both structured and
unstructured metadata with equal accuracy, aided by our LLM post-processing
protocol. Furthermore, we utilise LLMs to identify links between datasets, both
by calculating embedding similarity and by unifying the formats of extracted
metadata to enable rule-based processing. Our tool, which flexibly links the
metadata of different datasets, can therefore be used for ontology creation or
graph-based queries, for example, to find relevant ecological and environmental

concept activations derived via Sparse Autoencoders. We create English text
representations from OWL ontology classes, translate the English into French

open source Gemma Scope suite of Sparse Autoencoders, we obtain concept
activations for each class and language version. We average the different
language activations to derive a conceptual average. We then correlate the
conceptual averages with a ground truth mapping between ontology classes. Our
results give a strong indication that the conceptual average aligns to the true
relationship between classes when compared with a single language by itself.
The result hints at a new technique which enables mechanistic interpretation of
internal network states with higher accuracy.},

suitable annotation strategies depending on table characteristics. Experiments
are conducted on the Tough Tables and BiodivTab datasets from the SemTab

features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder

Abstract      = {Medication recommendation is a crucial task for assisting physicians in
making timely decisions from longitudinal patient medical records. However,
real-world EHR data present significant challenges due to the presence of
rarely observed medical entities and incomplete records that may not fully
capture the clinical ground truth. While data-driven models trained on
longitudinal Electronic Health Records often achieve strong empirical
performance, they struggle to generalize under missing or novel conditions,
largely due to their reliance on observed co-occurrence patterns. To address
these issues, we propose Hierarchical Ontology and Network Refinement for
Robust Medication Recommendation (HiRef), a unified framework that combines two
complementary structures: (i) the hierarchical semantics encoded in curated
medical ontologies, and (ii) refined co-occurrence patterns derived from
real-world EHRs. We embed ontology entities in hyperbolic space, which
naturally captures tree-like relationships and enables knowledge transfer
through shared ancestors, thereby improving generalizability to unseen codes.
To further improve robustness, we introduce a prior-guided sparse
regularization scheme that refines the EHR co-occurrence graph by suppressing
spurious edges while preserving clinically meaningful associations. Our model
achieves strong performance on EHR benchmarks (MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) and
maintains high accuracy under simulated unseen-code settings. Extensive
experiments with comprehensive ablation studies demonstrate HiRef's resilience
to unseen medical codes, supported by in-depth analyses of the learned
sparsified graph structure and medical code embeddings.},

embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based

high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual

outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a

Abstract      = {Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web

physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major
scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves
considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy,
time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology,
leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is
bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic
component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new,
weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical
approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific
scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising
model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics.
Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid
dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding,
and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific
strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource
allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.},

expressive access but require users to understand the ontology's structure and

interfaces are easier to use but often lack flexibility and expressiveness. We
introduce FuzzyVis, a proof-of-concept system that enables intuitive and
expressive exploration of complex ontologies. FuzzyVis integrates two key
components: a fuzzy logic-based querying model built on fuzzy ontology
embeddings, and an interactive visual interface for building and interpreting
queries. Users can construct new composite concepts by selecting and combining
existing ontology concepts using logical operators such as conjunction,
disjunction, and negation. These composite concepts are matched against the
ontology using fuzzy membership-based embeddings, which capture degrees of
membership and support approximate, concept-level similarity search. The visual
interface supports browsing, query composition, and partial search without
requiring formal syntax. By combining fuzzy semantics with embedding-based
reasoning, FuzzyVis enables flexible interpretation, efficient computation, and
exploratory learning. Case studies demonstrate how FuzzyVis supports subtle

forms a semantic layer that powers a digital twin-a virtual model of the

demonstrate that LSDTs support interpretable, regulation-aware layout

Abstract      = {Legal decision-making process requires the availability of comprehensive and

valuable tool to facilitate access to legal information, to be queried and

learning applications. Indeed, legal KGs may act as knowledge intensive
component to be used by pre-dictive machine learning solutions supporting the
decision process of the legal expert. Nevertheless, a few KGs can be found in
the legal domain. To fill this gap, we developed a legal KG targeting legal
cases of violence against women, along with clear adopted methodologies.
Specifically, the paper introduces two complementary approaches for automated
legal KG construction; a systematic bottom-up approach, customized for the
legal domain, and a new solution leveraging Large Language Models. Starting
from legal sentences publicly available from the European Court of Justice, the
solutions integrate structured data extraction, ontology development, and
semantic enrichment to produce KGs tailored for legal cases involving violence
against women. After analyzing and comparing the results of the two approaches,
the developed KGs are validated via suitable competency questions. The obtained
KG may be impactful for multiple purposes: can improve the accessibility to
legal information both to humans and machine, can enable complex queries and
may constitute an important knowledge component to be possibly exploited by
machine learning tools tailored for predictive justice.},

originating from ISA-95 and VDI-3682, a comprehensive OWL ontology addresses
shortcomings of conventional model-driven engineering for CPPS, particularly
inadequate undesired condition and error handling representation. The

intuitive interfaces for factory operators, production planners, and engineers
to interact with the entire model using natural language. Evaluation with the
use case addressing electric vehicle battery remanufacturing demonstrates that
the PPR-AKG approach efficiently supports resource allocation based on

can change and differ throughout the process, especially for explorative

iterative steps in the query building process using graph differences to
contrast the changes and the evolution in the graph query. We also enable users
to formulate their evolving information needs using a natural language
interface directly integrated into the difference query view. We, furthermore,
communicate the change in results in the result view by contrasting the
differences in both result distribution and individual instances of the

Abstract      = {In this work, we address the problem of grounding abnormalities in medical
images, where the goal is to localize clinical findings based on textual
descriptions. While generalist Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in natural
grounding tasks, they often struggle in the medical domain due to rare,
compositional, and domain-specific terms that are poorly aligned with visual
patterns. Specialized medical VLMs address this challenge via large-scale
domain pretraining, but at the cost of substantial annotation and computational
resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose \textbf{Knowledge to Sight
(K2Sight)}, a framework that introduces structured semantic supervision by
decomposing clinical concepts into interpretable visual attributes, such as
shape, density, and anatomical location. These attributes are distilled from
domain ontologies and encoded into concise instruction-style prompts, which
guide region-text alignment during training. Unlike conventional report-level
supervision, our approach explicitly bridges domain knowledge and spatial
structure, enabling data-efficient training of compact models. We train compact
models with 0.23B and 2B parameters using only 1.5\% of the data required by
state-of-the-art medical VLMs. Despite their small size and limited training

Abstract      = {The remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative tasks
has raised fundamental questions about the nature of their acquired
capabilities, which often appear to emerge unexpectedly without explicit
training. This paper examines the emergent properties of Deep Neural Networks
(DNNs) through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, addressing
the epistemological challenge of "creation without understanding" that
characterises contemporary AI development. We explore how the neural approach's
reliance on nonlinear, stochastic processes fundamentally differs from symbolic
computational paradigms, creating systems whose macro-level behaviours cannot
be analytically derived from micro-level neuron activities. Through analysis of
scaling laws, grokking phenomena, and phase transitions in model capabilities,
I demonstrate that emergent abilities arise from the complex dynamics of highly
sensitive nonlinear systems rather than simply from parameter scaling alone. My
investigation reveals that current debates over metrics, pre-training loss
thresholds, and in-context learning miss the fundamental ontological nature of
emergence in DNNs. I argue that these systems exhibit genuine emergent
properties analogous to those found in other complex natural phenomena, where
systemic capabilities emerge from cooperative interactions among simple
components without being reducible to their individual behaviours. The paper
concludes that understanding LLM capabilities requires recognising DNNs as a
new domain of complex dynamical systems governed by universal principles of
emergence, similar to those operating in physics, chemistry, and biology. This
perspective shifts the focus from purely phenomenological definitions of
emergence to understanding the internal dynamic transformations that enable
these systems to acquire capabilities that transcend their individual
components.},

Abstract      = {With the rapid advancement of autonomous driving, vehicle perception,
particularly detection and segmentation, has placed increasingly higher demands
on algorithmic performance. Pre-trained large segmentation models, especially
Segment Anything Model (SAM), have sparked significant interest and inspired
new research directions in artificial intelligence. However, SAM cannot be
directly applied to the fine-grained task of vehicle part segmentation, as its
text-prompted segmentation functionality is not publicly accessible, and the
mask regions generated by its default mode lack semantic labels, limiting its
utility in structured, category-specific segmentation tasks. To address these
limitations, we propose SAV, a novel framework comprising three core
components: a SAM-based encoder-decoder, a vehicle part knowledge graph, and a
context sample retrieval encoding module. The knowledge graph explicitly models
the spatial and geometric relationships among vehicle parts through a
structured ontology, effectively encoding prior structural knowledge.
Meanwhile, the context retrieval module enhances segmentation by identifying
and leveraging visually similar vehicle instances from training data, providing
rich contextual priors for improved generalization. Furthermore, we introduce a
new large-scale benchmark dataset for vehicle part segmentation, named
VehicleSeg10K, which contains 11,665 high-quality pixel-level annotations
across diverse scenes and viewpoints. We conduct comprehensive experiments on
this dataset and two other datasets, benchmarking multiple representative
baselines to establish a solid foundation for future research and comparison. %

Abstract      = {Taxonomies and ontologies of research topics (e.g., MeSH, UMLS, CSO, NLM)
play a central role in providing the primary framework through which
intelligent systems can explore and interpret the literature. However, these
resources have traditionally been manually curated, a process that is
time-consuming, prone to obsolescence, and limited in granularity. This paper
presents Sci-OG, a semi-auto\-mated methodology for generating research topic
ontologies, employing a multi-step approach: 1) Topic Discovery, extracting
potential topics from research papers; 2) Relationship Classification,
determining semantic relationships between topic pairs; and 3) Ontology
Construction, refining and organizing topics into a structured ontology. The
relationship classification component, which constitutes the core of the
system, integrates an encoder-based language model with features describing
topic occurrence in the scientific literature. We evaluate this approach
against a range of alternative solutions using a dataset of 21,649 manually
annotated semantic triples. Our method achieves the highest F1 score (0.951),
surpassing various competing approaches, including a fine-tuned SciBERT model
and several LLM baselines, such as the fine-tuned GPT4-mini. Our work is
corroborated by a use case which illustrates the practical application of our
system to extend the CSO ontology in the area of cybersecurity. The presented
solution is designed to improve the accessibility, organization, and analysis
of scientific knowledge, thereby supporting advancements in AI-enabled
literature management and research exploration.},

Abstract      = {The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.},

Abstract      = {Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

of qualia. Drawing on insights from nominalist philosophy and oversight
theoretic limits in AI, we argue that the observer paradox in quantum mechanics
reflects not an ontological lacuna, but a linguistic one: the absence of a
formal vocabulary for modeling first person structure. QAL introduces such a
vocabulary, providing a morphodynamic framework that embeds the observer within
the system and replaces abstract projection with endogenous transformation. We
analyze the alignment of QAL with endophysical approaches, contrast it with
standard interpretations of quantum theory, and explore its implications for a
post Platonist, introspectively grounded physics.},

Abstract      = {Standpoint extensions of knowledge representation formalisms have been
recently introduced as a means to incorporate multi-perspective modelling and
reasoning through modal operators that attribute pieces of knowledge to
specific entities or agents. In these extensions, the integration between
conceptual modelling and perspective annotations can vary in strength, with
monodic standpoint extensions offering a well-balanced approach. They allow for
advanced modelling features, such as the expression of rigid concepts, while
maintaining desirable reasoning complexity.
  We consider the extension of C2--the counting two-variable fragment of
first-order logic--by monodic standpoints. At the heart of our work is a
polynomial-time translation of formulas in this extended formalism into
standard, standpoint-free C2, a result that relies on intricate model-theoretic
arguments. Thanks to this translation, the satisfiability problem remains at
the same complexity level: NExpTime-complete, as in plain C2. Since our
formalism subsumes monodic S5 over C2, this result also marks a substantial
advancement in the study of first-order modal logics.
  From a practical standpoint, this means that highly expressive description
logics such as SHOIQBs and SROIQBs--which underpin the widely adopted OWL 1 and
OWL 2 ontology languages standardised by the W3C--can be extended with monodic
standpoints without increasing the standard reasoning complexity.
  We further prove that NExpTime-hardness arises even in significantly less
expressive description logics, as long as they include both nominals and
monodic standpoints. Moreover, we show that if the monodicity restriction is
relaxed even slightly in the presence of inverse roles, functionality, and
nominals, the satisfiability problem becomes undecidable.},

To address this gap, we introduce MetaExplainer, a neuro-symbolic framework

three-stage process: first, we decompose user questions into machine-readable
formats using state-of-the-art large language models (LLM); second, we delegate
the task of generating system recommendations to model explainer methods; and
finally, we synthesize natural language explanations that summarize the
explainer outputs. Throughout this process, we utilize an Explanation Ontology
to guide the language models and explainer methods. By leveraging LLMs and a
structured approach to explanation generation, MetaExplainer aims to enhance
the interpretability and trustworthiness of AI systems across various
applications, providing users with tailored, question-driven explanations that
better meet their needs. Comprehensive evaluations of MetaExplainer demonstrate
a step towards evaluating and utilizing current state-of-the-art explanation

these findings, highlighting the creativity and comprehensiveness of generated

MetaExplainer supports diverse explanation types, including Contrastive,

family of Shapley-value-based responsibility measures defined in terms of
weighted sums of minimal supports (WSMS). By exploiting results from the
database setting, we can show that such measures enjoy polynomial data
complexity for classes of ontology-mediated queries that are
first-order-rewritable, whereas the problem becomes "shP"-hard when the
ontology language can encode reachability queries (via axioms like $\exists R.
A \sqsubseteq A$). To better understand the tractability frontier, we next
explore the combined complexity of WSMS computation. We prove that
intractability applies already to atomic queries if the ontology language
supports conjunction, as well as to unions of `well-behaved' conjunctive
queries, even in the absence of an ontology. By contrast, our study yields
positive results for common DL-Lite dialects: by means of careful analysis, we
identify classes of structurally restricted conjunctive queries (which
intuitively disallow undesirable interactions between query atoms) that admit
tractable WSMS computation.},

Human psychological and educational tests are theory-driven measurement

benchmarks as measurements of traits such as ``intelligence'', despite known

Abstract      = {Detecting, analyzing, and predicting power outages is crucial for grid risk
assessment and disaster mitigation. Numerous outages occur each year,
exacerbated by extreme weather events such as hurricanes. Existing outage data
are typically reported at the county level, limiting their spatial resolution
and making it difficult to capture localized patterns. However, it offers
excellent temporal granularity. In contrast, nighttime light satellite image
data provides significantly higher spatial resolution and enables a more
comprehensive spatial depiction of outages, enhancing the accuracy of assessing
the geographic extent and severity of power loss after disaster events.
However, these satellite data are only available on a daily basis. Integrating
spatiotemporal visual and time-series data sources into a unified knowledge
representation can substantially improve power outage detection, analysis, and
predictive reasoning. In this paper, we propose GeoOutageKG, a multimodal
knowledge graph that integrates diverse data sources, including nighttime light
satellite image data, high-resolution spatiotemporal power outage maps, and
county-level timeseries outage reports in the U.S. We describe our method for
constructing GeoOutageKG by aligning source data with a developed ontology,
GeoOutageOnto. Currently, GeoOutageKG includes over 10.6 million individual
outage records spanning from 2014 to 2024, 300,000 NTL images spanning from
2012 to 2024, and 15,000 outage maps. GeoOutageKG is a novel, modular and

demonstrate its use through multiresolution analysis of geospatiotemporal power

Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have transformed data management within the
manufacturing industry, offering effective means for integrating disparate data
sources through shared and structured conceptual schemas. However, harnessing
the power of KGs can be daunting for non-experts, as it often requires
formulating complex SPARQL queries to retrieve specific information. With the
advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is a growing potential to
automatically translate natural language queries into the SPARQL format, thus
bridging the gap between user-friendly interfaces and the sophisticated
architecture of KGs. The challenge remains in adequately informing LLMs about
the relevant context and structure of domain-specific KGs, e.g., in
manufacturing, to improve the accuracy of generated queries. In this paper, we
evaluate multiple strategies that use LLMs as mediators to facilitate
information retrieval from KGs. We focus on the manufacturing domain,
particularly on the Bosch Line Information System KG and the I40 Core
Information Model. In our evaluation, we compare various approaches for feeding
relevant context from the KG to the LLM and analyze their proficiency in
transforming real-world questions into SPARQL queries. Our findings show that
LLMs can significantly improve their performance on generating correct and
complete queries when provided only the adequate context of the KG schema. Such
context-aware prompting techniques help LLMs to focus on the relevant parts of
the ontology and reduce the risk of hallucination. We anticipate that the
proposed techniques help LLMs to democratize access to complex data
repositories and empower informed decision-making in manufacturing settings.},

data quality issues, such as semantically overlapping nodes. Yet ensuring their
quality is essential, as issues in the data can affect applications relying on
them. To assess the quality of knowledge graphs, existing works propose either
high-level frameworks comprising various data quality dimensions without
concrete implementations, define tools that measure data quality with ad-hoc
SPARQL queries, or promote the usage of constraint languages, such as the
Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), to assess and improve the quality of the
graph. Although the latter approaches claim to address data quality assessment,
none of them comprehensively tries to cover all data quality dimensions. In
this paper, we explore this gap by investigating the extent to which SHACL can
be used to assess data quality in knowledge graphs. Specifically, we defined
SHACL shapes for 69 data quality metrics proposed by Zaveri et al. [1] and
implemented a prototype that automatically instantiates these shapes and
computes the corresponding data quality measures from their validation results.

3.7 Sonnet, Grok-3, and LLaMA 4 in zero-shot and few-shot settings, comparing
their performance against traditional models like Random Forests across
multiple real-world datasets. Our results show that LLMs not only outperform
baselines in ontology classification, but also demonstrate strong predictive
ability for contamination risk, generalizing across sites and metadata
distributions. These findings suggest that LLMs can effectively reason over
sparse, heterogeneous biological metadata and offer a promising metadata-only
approach for environmental microbiology and biosurveillance applications.},

Abstract      = {Ontologies and knowledge graphs require continuous evolution to remain
comprehensive and accurate, but manual curation is labor intensive. Large
Language Models (LLMs) possess vast unstructured knowledge but struggle with
maintaining structured consistency. We propose Evo-DKD, a novel dual-decoder
framework for autonomous ontology evolution that combines structured ontology
traversal with unstructured text reasoning. Evo-DKD introduces two parallel
decoding streams within an LLM: one decoder generates candidate ontology edits
(e.g., new concepts or relations) while the other produces natural-language
justifications. A dynamic attention-based gating mechanism coordinates the two
streams, deciding at each step how to blend structured and unstructured
knowledge. Due to GPU constraints, we simulate the dual-decoder behavior using
prompt-based mode control to approximate coordinated decoding in a
single-stream mode. The system operates in a closed reasoning loop: proposed
ontology edits are validated (via consistency checks and cross-verification
with the text explanations) and then injected into the knowledge base, which in
turn informs subsequent reasoning. We demonstrate Evo-DKD's effectiveness on
use cases including healthcare ontology refinement, semantic search
improvement, and cultural heritage timeline modeling. Experiments show that
Evo-DKD outperforms baselines using structured-only or unstructured-only
decoding in both precision of ontology updates and downstream task performance.
We present quantitative metrics and qualitative examples, confirming the
contributions of the dual-decoder design and gating router. Evo-DKD offers a
new paradigm for LLM-driven knowledge base maintenance, combining the strengths
of symbolic and neural reasoning for sustainable ontology evolution.},

We propose an ontology enhanced KGC method using LLMs -- OL-KGC. It first
leverages neural perceptual mechanisms to effectively embed structural
information into the textual space, and then uses an automated extraction
algorithm to retrieve ontological knowledge from the knowledge graphs (KGs)
that needs to be completed, which is further transformed into a textual format
comprehensible to LLMs for providing logic guidance. We conducted extensive

form which one expects from the stress energy tensor describing a Lorentz
invariant vacuum energy density (Dark Energy). We identify the dark-energy
density with the tension of the fundamental 3 brane and thereby establish a
direct correspondence between the cosmological constant and brane tension.
Finally, we present a brief argument as to why the Cosmological Constant should
be treated as a fundamental constant of nature, based on some light ontological
discussion regarding the origin of the tension term in the broader framework of
String Theory. In a forthcoming work, we will articulate a dynamical mechanism,
which will be grounded in Q-theory, Hawking-Wu flux neutralization and broken
super-symmetry, demonstrating the precise cancellation of vacuum energy in a

PrimaryClass  = {q-bio.OT},
Abstract      = {Objective: Develop a Non Invasive Respiratory Support (NIRS) ontology to
support knowledge representation in acute care settings.
  Materials and Methods: We developed the NIRS ontology using Web Ontology
Language (OWL) semantics and Protege to organize clinical concepts and
relationships. To enable rule-based clinical reasoning beyond hierarchical
structures, we added Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules. We evaluated
logical reasoning by adding 17 hypothetical patient clinical scenarios. We used
SPARQL queries and data from the Electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU)
Collaborative Research Database to retrieve and test targeted inferences.
  Results: The ontology has 132 classes, 12 object properties, and 17 data
properties across 882 axioms that establish concept relationships. To
standardize clinical concepts, we added 350 annotations, including descriptive
definitions based on controlled vocabularies. SPARQL queries successfully
validated all test cases (rules) by retrieving appropriate patient outcomes,
for instance, a patient treated with HFNC (high-flow nasal cannula) for 2 hours
due to acute respiratory failure may avoid endotracheal intubation.
  Discussion: The NIRS ontology formally represents domain-specific concepts,
including ventilation modalities, patient characteristics, therapy parameters,
and outcomes. SPARQL query evaluations on clinical scenarios confirmed the
ability of the ontology to support rule based reasoning and therapy
recommendations, providing a foundation for consistent documentation practices,
integration into clinical data models, and advanced analysis of NIRS outcomes.
  Conclusion: We unified NIRS concepts into an ontological framework and
demonstrated its applicability through the evaluation of hypothetical patient
scenarios and alignment with standardized vocabularies.},

Abstract      = {Since the introduction of Digital Engineering (DE) as a well-defined concept
in 2018, organizations and industry groups have been working to interpret the
DE concepts to establish consistent meta-models of those interrelated concepts

used in these international standards continues to improve with each revision,

advancing neurosymbolic AI. A primary bottleneck in realizing this potential is
the difficulty of automating KG construction, which faces challenges related to
output reliability, consistency, and verifiability. These issues can manifest
as structural inconsistencies within the generated graphs, such as the
formation of disconnected $\textit{isolated islands}$ of data or the inaccurate
conflation of abstract classes with specific instances. To address these
challenges, we propose HyDRA, a $\textbf{Hy}$brid-$\textbf{D}$riven
$\textbf{R}$easoning $\textbf{A}$rchitecture designed for verifiable KG
automation. Given a domain or an initial set of documents, HyDRA first
constructs an ontology via a panel of collaborative neurosymbolic agents. These
agents collaboratively agree on a set of competency questions (CQs) that define
the scope and requirements the ontology must be able to answer. Given these
CQs, we build an ontology graph that subsequently guides the automated
extraction of triplets for KG generation from arbitrary documents. Inspired by
design-by-contracts (DbC) principles, our method leverages verifiable contracts
as the primary control mechanism to steer the generative process of Large
Language Models (LLMs). To verify the output of our approach, we extend beyond
standard benchmarks and propose an evaluation framework that assesses the
functional correctness of the resulting KG by leveraging symbolic verifications

automated KG construction and the exploration of evaluation methods for

identify mappings between triples that convey comparable information, using
these mappings to improve entity-matching accuracy. Our approach demonstrates
competitive performance compared to leading systems in the OAEI competition and

model-checkers and theorem provers ensure software correctness by verifying the
implementation against the specification. Formal methods deployment is
regularly enforced in the development of safety-critical systems e.g.
aerospace, medical devices and autonomous systems. Generating these

Abstract      = {Ontology Matching (OM) is a cornerstone task of semantic interoperability,

limited adaptability. We present KROMA, a novel OM framework that harnesses
Large Language Models (LLMs) within a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
pipeline to dynamically enrich the semantic context of OM tasks with
structural, lexical, and definitional knowledge. To optimize both performance
and efficiency, KROMA integrates a bisimilarity-based concept matching and a
lightweight ontology refinement step, which prune candidate concepts and
substantially reduce the communication overhead from invoking LLMs. Through
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that integrating knowledge
retrieval with context-augmented LLMs significantly enhances ontology matching,
outperforming both classic OM systems and cutting-edge LLM-based approaches
while keeping communication overhead comparable. Our study highlights the
feasibility and benefit of the proposed optimization techniques (targeted
knowledge retrieval, prompt enrichment, and ontology refinement) for ontology
matching at scale.},

Abstract      = {In the field of knowledge management and computer science, ontologies provide
a structured framework for modeling domain-specific knowledge by defining
concepts and their relationships. However, the lack of tools that provide
effective visualization is still a significant challenge. While numerous
ontology editors and viewers exist, most of them fail to graphically represent
ontology structures in a meaningful and non-overwhelming way, limiting users'
ability to comprehend dependencies and properties within large ontological
frameworks.
  In this paper, we present OntView, an ontology viewer that is designed to
provide users with an intuitive visual representation of ontology concepts and
their formal definitions through a user-friendly interface. Building on the use
of a DL reasoner, OntView follows a "What you see is what you meant" paradigm,
showing the actual inferred knowledge. One key aspect for this is its ability
to visualize General Concept Inclusions (GCI), a feature absent in existing
visualization tools. Moreover, to avoid a possible information overload,
OntView also offers different ways to show a simplified view of the ontology
by: 1) creating ontology summaries by assessing the importance of the concepts
(according to different available algorithms), 2) focusing the visualization on
the existing TBox elements between two given classes and 3) allowing to
hide/show different branches in a dynamic way without losing the semantics.

probabilistic reasoning could guide dynamic, uncertainty-based governance. By
foregrounding epistemic and ontological ambiguity, and drawing analogies from
cognitive neuroscience and predictive processing, we suggest a new model of

Abstract      = {SHACL and OWL are two prominent W3C standards for managing RDF data. These
languages share many features, but they have one fundamental difference: OWL,
designed for inferring facts from incomplete data, makes the open-world
assumption, whereas SHACL is a constraint language that treats the data as
complete and must be validated under the closed-world assumption. The
combination of both formalisms is very appealing and has been called for, but
their semantic gap is a major challenge, semantically and computationally. In
this paper, we advocate a semantics for SHACL validation in the presence of
ontologies based on core universal models. We provide a technique for
constructing these models for ontologies in the rich data-tractable description
logic Horn-ALCHIQ. Furthermore, we use a finite representation of this model to
develop a rewriting technique that reduces SHACL validation in the presence of
ontologies to standard validation. Finally, we study the complexity of SHACL
validation in the presence of ontologies, and show that even very simple
ontologies make the problem EXPTIME-complete, and PTIME-complete in data
complexity.},

Abstract      = {Personal service robots are deployed to support daily living in domestic

These robots must perceive complex and dynamic surroundings, understand tasks,
and execute context-appropriate actions. However, current systems rely on
proprietary, hard-coded solutions tied to specific hardware and software,
resulting in siloed implementations that are difficult to adapt and scale
across platforms. Ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) offer a solution to
enable interoperability across systems, through structured and standardized
representations of knowledge and reasoning. However, symbolic systems such as
KGs and ontologies struggle with raw and noisy sensory input. In contrast,
multimodal language models are well suited for interpreting input such as
images and natural language, but often lack transparency, consistency, and
knowledge grounding. In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic framework that
combines the perceptual strengths of multimodal language models with the
structured representations provided by KGs and ontologies, with the aim of
supporting interoperability in robotic applications. Our approach generates
ontology-compliant KGs that can inform robot behavior in a platform-independent
manner. We evaluated this framework by integrating robot perception data,
ontologies, and five multimodal models (three LLaMA and two GPT models), using
different modes of neural-symbolic interaction. We assess the consistency and
effectiveness of the generated KGs across multiple runs and configurations, and
perform statistical analyzes to evaluate performance. Results show that GPT-o1

findings also indicate that newer models do not guarantee better results,

Abstract      = {Understanding semantic relationships within complex networks derived from
lexical resources is fundamental for network science and language modeling.
While network embedding methods capture contextual similarity, quantifying
semantic distance based directly on explicit definitional structure remains
challenging. Accurate measures of semantic similarity allow for navigation on
lexical networks based on maximizing semantic similarity in each navigation
jump (Semantic Navigation, SN). This work introduces Ontological
Differentiation (OD), a formal method for measuring divergence between concepts
by analyzing overlap during recursive definition expansion. The methodology is
applied to networks extracted from the Simple English Wiktionary, comparing OD
scores with other measures of semantic similarity proposed in the literature
(cosine similarity based on random-walk network exploration). We find weak
correlations between direct pairwise OD scores and cosine similarities across
~2 million word pairs, sampled from a pool representing over 50% of the entries
in the Wiktionary lexicon. This establishes OD as a largely independent,
definition-based semantic metric, whose orthogonality to cosine similarity
becomes more pronounced when low-semantic-content terms were removed from the
dataset. Additionally, we use cumulative OD scores to evaluate paths generated
by vector-based SN and structurally optimal Shortest Paths (SP) across
networks. We find SN paths consistently exhibit significantly lower cumulative
OD scores than shortest paths, suggesting that SN produces trajectories more
coherent with the dictionary's definitional structure, as measured by OD.
Ontological Differentiation thus provides a novel, definition-grounded tool for
analyzing semantic structure and validating navigation processes in lexical
networks.},

Abstract      = {Modern high-performance computing (HPC) systems generate massive volumes of
heterogeneous telemetry data from millions of sensors monitoring compute,
memory, power, cooling, and storage subsystems. As HPC infrastructures scale to
support increasingly complex workloads-including generative AI-the need for
efficient, reliable, and interoperable telemetry analysis becomes critical.
Operational Data Analytics (ODA) has emerged to address these demands; however,
the reliance on schema-less storage solutions limits data accessibility and
semantic integration. Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KG) provide an effective
way to enable efficient and expressive data querying by capturing domain
semantics, but they face challenges such as significant storage overhead and
the limited applicability of existing ontologies, which are often tailored to
specific HPC systems only. In this paper, we present the first unified ontology
for ODA in HPC systems, designed to enable semantic interoperability across
heterogeneous data centers. Our ontology models telemetry data from the two
largest publicly available ODA datasets-M100 (Cineca, Italy) and F-DATA
(Fugaku, Japan)-within a single data model. The ontology is validated through
36 competency questions reflecting real-world stakeholder requirements, and we
introduce modeling optimizations that reduce knowledge graph (KG) storage
overhead by up to 38.84% compared to a previous approach, with an additional
26.82% reduction depending on the desired deployment configuration. This work
paves the way for scalable ODA KGs and supports not only analysis within
individual systems, but also cross-system analysis across heterogeneous HPC
systems.},

Abstract      = {One of the main objectives in developing large vision-language models (LVLMs)
is to engineer systems that can assist humans with multimodal tasks, including
interpreting descriptions of perceptual experiences. A central phenomenon in
this context is amodal completion, in which people perceive objects even when
parts of those objects are hidden. Although numerous studies have assessed
whether computer-vision algorithms can detect or reconstruct occluded regions,
the inferential abilities of LVLMs on texts related to amodal completion remain
unexplored. To address this gap, we constructed a benchmark grounded in Basic
Formal Ontology to achieve a systematic classification of amodal completion.
Our results indicate that while many LVLMs achieve human-comparable performance
overall, their accuracy diverges for certain types of objects being completed.
Notably, in certain categories, some LLaVA-NeXT variants and Claude 3.5 Sonnet
exhibit lower accuracy on original images compared to blank stimuli lacking
visual content. Intriguingly, this disparity emerges only under Japanese
prompting, suggesting a deficiency in Japanese-specific linguistic competence
among these models.},

StructSense is guided by domain-specific symbolic knowledge encoded in

further incorporates agentic capabilities through self-evaluative judges that
form a feedback loop for iterative refinement, and includes human-in-the-loop
mechanisms to ensure quality and validation. We demonstrate that StructSense

Abstract      = {In complex systems research, the study of higher-order interactions has
exploded in recent years. Researchers have formalized various types of group
interactions, such as public goods games, biological contagion, and information
broadcasting, showing how higher-order networks can capture group effects more
directly than pairwise models. However, equating hyperedges-edges involving
more than two agents-with groups can be misleading, as it obscures the
polysemous nature of ``group interactions''. For instance, many models of
higher-order interactions focus on the internal state of the hyperedge,
specifying dynamical rules at the group level. These models often neglect how
interactions with external groups can influence behaviors and dynamics within
the group. Yet, anthropologists and philosophers remind us that external norms,
factors, and forces governing intergroup behavior are essential to defining
within-group dynamics. In this paper, we synthesize concepts from social
ontology relevant to the emerging physics of higher-order networks. We propose
a typology for classifying models of group interactions based on two
perspectives. The first focuses on individuals within groups engaging in
collective action, where shared agency serves as the binding force. The second
adopts a group-first approach, emphasizing institutional facts that extend
beyond the specific individuals involved. Building on these perspectives, we
introduce four dimensions to classify models of group interactions:
persistence, coupling, reducibility, and alignment. For the physics of
higher-order networks, we provide a hierarchy of nested mathematical models to
explore the complex properties of social groups. We highlight social
interactions not yet explored in the literature on higher-order networks and
propose future research avenues to foster collaboration between social ontology
and the physics of complex systems.},

of CQ patterns, and generation using state of the art LLMs. We generate CQs
using each approach from a set of requirements for cultural heritage, and
assess them across different dimensions: degree of acceptability, ambiguity,
relevance, readability and complexity. Our contribution is twofold: (i) the
first multi-annotator dataset of CQs generated from the same source using
different methods; and (ii) a systematic comparison of the characteristics of
the CQs resulting from each approach. Our study shows that different CQ
generation approaches have different characteristics and that LLMs can be used
as a way to initially elicit CQs, however these are sensitive to the model used
to generate CQs and they generally require a further refinement step before
they can be used to model requirements.},

modeling capabilities for representing security risk management scenarios, (b)
a qualitative assessment to find root causes and minimal conditions of
successful attacks, and (c) quantitative analyses via security metrics
computation under formal semantics, such as minimal time and cost among all
attacks. Still, the AT language presents limitations due to its lack of
ontological foundations, thus compromising associated services. Via an
ontological analysis grounded in the Common Ontology of Value and Risk (COVER)

(4) lack of semantic interoperability, resulting in ad hoc stand-alone tools.

Abstract      = {Symptom Checkers (SCs) provide medical information tailored to user symptoms.
A critical challenge in SC development is preventing unexpected performance
degradation for individual diseases, especially rare diseases, when updating
algorithms. This risk stems from the lack of practical pre-deployment
evaluation methods. For rare diseases, obtaining sufficient evaluation data
from user feedback is difficult. To evaluate the impact of algorithm updates on
the diagnostic performance for individual rare diseases before deployment, this
study proposes and validates a novel Synthetic Vignette Simulation Approach.
This approach aims to enable this essential evaluation efficiently and at a low
cost. To estimate the impact of algorithm updates, we generated synthetic
vignettes from disease-phenotype annotations in the Human Phenotype Ontology
(HPO), a publicly available knowledge base for rare diseases curated by
experts. Using these vignettes, we simulated SC interviews to predict changes
in diagnostic performance. The effectiveness of this approach was validated
retrospectively by comparing the predicted changes with actual performance
metrics using the R-squared ($R^2$) coefficient. Our experiment, covering eight
past algorithm updates for rare diseases, showed that the proposed method
accurately predicted performance changes for diseases with phenotype frequency
information in HPO (n=5). For these updates, we found a strong correlation for
both Recall@8 change ($R^2$ = 0.83,$p$ = 0.031) and Precision@8 change ($R^2$ =
0.78,$p$ = 0.047). Our proposed method enables the pre-deployment evaluation of
SC algorithm changes for individual rare diseases. This evaluation is based on
a publicly available medical knowledge database created by experts, ensuring
transparency and explainability for stakeholders. Additionally, SC developers
can efficiently improve diagnostic performance at a low cost.},

applied across multiple process contexts. This highlights the necessity of a
consistent and semantically coherent model to ensure the correctness of data

to address key challenges such as selecting context-relevant data, ensuring
unit compatibility between variables and data elements, and verifying the

includes (i) SPARQL-based filtering to retrieve process-relevant data, (ii) a
unit consistency check based on expected-unit annotations and semantic

public repositories; (2) semi-automated normalization and augmentation of
metadata of cohorts and samples using biomedical ontologies and clustering on
the embedding space; (3) automated generation of a natural language
question-answering (QA) dataset for cohorts and samples based on randomized
combinations of standardized metadata dimensions and (4) fine-tuning of a
domain-specific embedder to optimize queries. We illustrate the approach using
the GEO repository and the PubMedBERT pretrained embedder. Applying NeuroEmbed,
we semantically indexed 2,801 repositories and 150,924 samples. Amongst many
biology-relevant categories, we normalized more than 1,700 heterogeneous tissue
labels from GEO into 326 unique ontology-aligned concepts and enriched
annotations with new ontology-aligned terms, leading to a fold increase in size
for the metadata terms between 2.7 and 20 fold. After fine-tuning PubMedBERT
with the QA training data augmented with the enlarged metadata, the model
increased its mean Retrieval Precision from 0.277 to 0.866 and its mean
Percentile Rank from 0.355 to 0.896. The NeuroEmbed methodology for the
creation of electronic catalogues of omics cohorts and samples will foster
automated bioinformatic pipelines construction. The NeuroEmbed catalogue of
cohorts and samples is available at https://github.com/JoseAdrian3/NeuroEmbed.},

Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) possess intricate internal representations of
the world, yet these latent structures are notoriously difficult to interpret
or repurpose beyond the original prediction task. Building on our earlier work
(Rothenfusser, 2025), which introduced the concept of vector ontologies as a
framework for translating high-dimensional neural representations into
interpretable geometric structures, this paper provides the first empirical
validation of that approach. A vector ontology defines a domain-specific vector
space spanned by ontologically meaningful dimensions, allowing geometric
analysis of concepts and relationships within a domain. We construct an
8-dimensional vector ontology of musical genres based on Spotify audio features
and test whether an LLM's internal world model of music can be consistently and
accurately projected into this space. Using GPT-4o-mini, we extract genre
representations through multiple natural language prompts and analyze the
consistency of these projections across linguistic variations and their
alignment with ground-truth data. Our results show (1) high spatial consistency
of genre projections across 47 query formulations, (2) strong alignment between
LLM-inferred genre locations and real-world audio feature distributions, and
(3) evidence of a direct relationship between prompt phrasing and spatial
shifts in the LLM's inferred vector ontology. These findings demonstrate that
LLMs internalize structured, repurposable knowledge and that vector ontologies
offer a promising method for extracting and analyzing this knowledge in a
transparent and verifiable way.},

enrich itself through rules defined in SPARQL, allowing for the inference of

Actualization Logic (SAL) in which modalities are indexed by levels of
ontological stability, interpreted as admissibility regimes. Each modality
operates over a structured layer of possibility, grounded in the internal
coherence of transitions between layers. We formally define the syntax and
semantics of SAL, introduce its axioms, and prove soundness and completeness.
Applications are discussed in connection with temporal becoming, quantum
decoherence domains, and modal metaphysics. The result is a logic that captures
the ontological structure of actualization without recourse to abstract
possible worlds, offering a stratified alternative to standard modal realism.},

We address the second problem by presenting an algorithm derived from a

computational geometry. We find that the complexity of deciding the existence
of a noncontextual ontological model of dimension $k$ is at least exponential
in the dimension of the theory and at most exponential in $k$. This, in turn,
implies that computing the smallest noncontextual ontological model is
inefficient in general. Finally, we demonstrate the fundamental difference

ontological model using an explicit example wherein the respective minimum

Abstract      = {Effectively representing legal norms for automated processing is a critical
challenge, particularly in tracking the temporal evolution of their
hierarchical components. While foundational conceptual frameworks like IFLA
LRMoo provide a generic toolkit for bibliographic data, and encoding standards
like Akoma Ntoso offer a robust syntax for legal documents, a dedicated, formal
modeling pattern for granular, component-level versioning is still required.
This limitation hinders the deterministic point-intime reconstruction of legal
texts, a fundamental capability for reliable Legal Tech and AI applications.
This paper proposes a structured, temporal modeling pattern grounded in the
LRMoo ontology to address this need. Our approach models the evolution of a
legal norm as a diachronic chain of F2 Expressions. We introduce a key
distinction between a language-agnostic Temporal Version (TV)-a semantic
snapshot of the norm's structure-and its concrete monolingual realizations, the
Language Versions (LV). Both are modeled as F2 Expressions linked by the
canonical R76 is derivative of property. This paradigm is applied recursively
to the legal text's internal structure, representing it as a parallel hierarchy
of abstract Component Works (F1) and their versioned Component Expressions
(F2). Furthermore, we formalize the legislative amendment process using the F28
Expression Creation event, allowing changes to be traced from an amending act
to its precise effect on the amended norm. Using the Brazilian Federal
Constitution as a case study, we demonstrate how this event-centric
architecture enables the precise, deterministic retrieval and reconstruction of
any part of a legal text as it existed on a specific date. The model provides a
robust foundation for building verifiable knowledge graphs and advanced AI
tools, overcoming the limitations of current generative models.},

Abstract      = {The increasing complexity of modern manufacturing, coupled with demand
fluctuation, supply chain uncertainties, and product customization, underscores
the need for manufacturing systems that can flexibly update their
configurations and swiftly adapt to disturbances. However, current research
falls short in providing a holistic reconfigurable manufacturing framework that
seamlessly monitors system disturbances, optimizes alternative line
configurations based on machine capabilities, and automates simulation
evaluation for swift adaptations. This paper presents a dynamic manufacturing
line reconfiguration framework to handle disturbances that result in operation
time changes. The framework incorporates a system process digital twin for
monitoring disturbances and triggering reconfigurations, a capability-based
ontology model capturing available agent and resource options, a configuration
optimizer generating optimal line configurations, and a simulation generation
program initializing simulation setups and evaluating line configurations at
approximately 400x real-time speed. A case study of a battery production line
has been conducted to evaluate the proposed framework. In two implemented
disturbance scenarios, the framework successfully recovers system throughput
with limited resources, preventing the 26% and 63% throughput drops that would
have occurred without a reconfiguration plan. The reconfiguration optimizer
efficiently finds optimal solutions, taking an average of 0.03 seconds to find
a reconfiguration plan for a manufacturing line with 51 operations and 40
available agents across 8 agent types.},

Abstract      = {Time-continuous dynamic models are essential for various Cyber-Physical
System (CPS) applications. To ensure effective usability in different lifecycle
phases, such behavioral information in the form of differential equations must
be contextualized and integrated with further CPS information. While knowledge
graphs provide a formal description and structuring mechanism for this task,
there is a lack of reusable ontological artifacts and methods to reduce manual
instantiation effort. Hence, this contribution introduces two artifacts:
Firstly, a modular semantic model based on standards is introduced to represent
differential equations directly within knowledge graphs and to enrich them
semantically. Secondly, a method for efficient knowledge graph generation is
presented. A validation of these artifacts was conducted in the domain of
aviation maintenance. Results show that differential equations of a complex
Electro-Hydraulic Servoactuator can be formally represented in a knowledge
graph and be contextualized with other lifecycle data, proving the artifacts'
practical applicability.},

Abstract      = {Extracting structured computational representations of historical events from
narrative text remains computationally expensive when constructed manually.
While RDF/OWL reasoners enable graph-based reasoning, they are limited to
fragments of first-order logic, preventing deeper temporal and semantic
analysis. This paper addresses both challenges by developing automatic
historical event extraction models using multiple LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, Llama
3.2) with three enhancement strategies: pure base generation, knowledge graph
enhancement, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We conducted
comprehensive evaluations using historical texts from Thucydides. Our findings
reveal that enhancement strategies optimize different performance dimensions
rather than providing universal improvements. For coverage and historical
breadth, base generation achieves optimal performance with Claude and GPT-4
extracting comprehensive events. However, for precision, RAG enhancement
improves coordinate accuracy and metadata completeness. Model architecture
fundamentally determines enhancement sensitivity: larger models demonstrate
robust baseline performance with incremental RAG improvements, while Llama 3.2
shows extreme variance from competitive performance to complete failure. We
then developed an automated translation pipeline converting extracted RDF
representations into Coq proof assistant specifications, enabling higher-order
reasoning beyond RDF capabilities including multi-step causal verification,
temporal arithmetic with BC dates, and formal proofs about historical
causation. The Coq formalization validates that RAG-discovered event types
represent legitimate domain-specific semantic structures rather than
ontological violations.},

Abstract      = {There are many types of standards in the field of communication. The

models with the construction of knowledge graphs to implement an intelligent
consultation and question-answering system for communication standards. The
experimental results show that after LoRA tuning on the constructed dataset of
6,587 questions and answers in the field of communication standards,
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct demonstrates outstanding professional capabilities in the
field of communication standards on the test set. BLEU-4 rose from 18.8564 to
66.8993, and evaluation indicators such as ROUGE also increased significantly,
outperforming the fine-tuning effect of the comparison model
Llama-3-8B-Instruct. Based on the ontology framework containing 6 entity
attributes and 10 relation attributes, a knowledge graph of the communication
standard domain containing 13,906 entities and 13,524 relations was
constructed, showing a relatively good query accuracy rate. The intelligent
consultation and question-answering system enables the fine-tuned model on the
server side to access the locally constructed knowledge graph and conduct
graphical retrieval of key information first, which is conducive to improving
the question-answering effect. The evaluation using DeepSeek as the Judge on
the test set shows that our RAG framework enables the fine-tuned model to
improve the scores at all five angles, with an average score increase of 2.26%.
And combined with web services and API interfaces, it has achieved very good
results in terms of interaction experience and back-end access, and has very
good practical application value.},

Abstract      = {Domain generalization has become a critical challenge in clinical prediction,
where patient cohorts often exhibit shifting data distributions that degrade
model performance. Typical domain generalization approaches struggle in
real-world healthcare settings for two main reasons: (1) patient-specific
domain labels are typically unavailable, making domain discovery especially
difficult; (2) purely data-driven approaches overlook key clinical insights,
leading to a gap in medical knowledge integration. To address these problems,
we leverage hierarchical medical ontologies like the ICD-9-CM hierarchy to
group diseases into higher-level categories and discover more flexible latent
domains. In this paper, we introduce UdonCare, a hierarchy-guided framework
that iteratively prunes fine-grained domains, encodes these refined domains,
and applies a Siamese-type inference mechanism to separate domain-related
signals from patient-level features. Experimental results on clinical datasets
(MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV) show that the proposed model achieves higher
performance compared to other domain generalization baselines when substantial
domain gaps presents, highlighting the untapped potential of medical knowledge
for enhancing domain generalization in practical healthcare applications.},

Abstract      = {ISO 639:2023 unifies the ISO language-code family and introduces contextual
metadata, but it lacks a machine-native mechanism for handling dialectal drift
and creole mixtures. We propose a formalisation of recursive semantic
anchoring, attaching to every language entity $\chi$ a family of fixed-point
operators $\phi_{n,m}$ that model bounded semantic drift via the relation
$\phi_{n,m}(\chi) = \chi \oplus \Delta(\chi)$, where $\Delta(\chi)$ is a drift
vector in a latent semantic manifold. The base anchor $\phi_{0,0}$ recovers the
canonical ISO 639:2023 identity, whereas $\phi_{99,9}$ marks the maximal drift
state that triggers a deterministic fallback. Using category theory, we treat
the operators $\phi_{n,m}$ as morphisms and drift vectors as arrows in a
category $\mathrm{DriftLang}$. A functor $\Phi: \mathrm{DriftLang} \to
\mathrm{AnchorLang}$ maps every drifted object to its unique anchor and proves
convergence. We provide an RDF/Turtle schema (\texttt{BaseLanguage},
\texttt{DriftedLanguage}, \texttt{ResolvedAnchor}) and worked examples -- e.g.,
$\phi_{8,4}$ (Standard Mandarin) versus $\phi_{8,7}$ (a colloquial variant),
and $\phi_{1,7}$ for Nigerian Pidgin anchored to English. Experiments with
transformer models show higher accuracy in language identification and
translation on noisy or code-switched input when the $\phi$-indices are used to
guide fallback routing. The framework is compatible with ISO/TC 37 and provides
an AI-tractable, drift-aware semantic layer for future standards.},

Abstract      = {The implementation of transformational pedagogy in secondary education
classrooms requires a broad multiliteracy approach. Due to limited planning
time and resources, high school English Literature teachers often struggle to
curate diverse, thematically aligned literature text sets. This study addresses
the critical need for a tool that provides scaffolds for novice educators in
selecting literature texts that are diverse -- in terms of genre, theme,
subtheme, and author -- yet similar in context and pedagogical merits. We have
developed a recommendation system, Teaching Text Expansion for Teacher
Scaffolding (T-TExTS), that suggests high school English Literature books based
on pedagogical merits, genre, and thematic relevance using a knowledge graph.
We constructed a domain-specific ontology using the KNowledge Acquisition and
Representation Methodology (KNARM), transformed into a knowledge graph, which
was then embedded using DeepWalk, biased random walk, and a hybrid of both
approaches. The system was evaluated using link prediction and recommendation
performance metrics, including Area Under the Curve (AUC), Mean Reciprocal Rank
(MRR), Hits@K, and normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (nDCG). DeepWalk
outperformed in most ranking metrics, with the highest AUC (0.9431), whereas
the hybrid model offered balanced performance. These findings demonstrate the
importance of semantic, ontology-driven approaches in recommendation systems
and suggest that T-TExTS can significantly ease the burden of English
Literature text selection for high school educators, promoting more informed

theory with complex valued wavefunctions, or more generally by quantum states
in an abstract linear vector space. Determining the physical nature of
wavefunctions remains an open problem that is at the very core of quantum
mechanics, About a decade ago, Pusey, Barrett and Rudolf (PBR) claimed to prove
an ontologically real status of wavefunctions by ruling out $\psi$-epistemic
models. The result was obtained by associating wavefunctions to hypothetical
distributions of notional physical states, and by examining whether some
physical states were associated with more than one wavefunction, a criterion
they chose for defining a wavefunction as `epistemic'. I show that the starting
assumption in the PBR argument, of associating a wavefunction with a
distribution of physical states, is flawed and contradictory to the linear
structure of quantum mechanics coupled with its quadratic Born's rule. Since
none of the axioms or calculations of observable statistical results in the
standard quantum theory depends on specifying the physical nature of a
$\psi$-function, the considerations in the PBR paper, involving a standard
process of the preparation and projective measurements of quantum states,
cannot address the ontological status of the wavefunctions in space and time.},

Abstract      = {Zero-shot Event Detection (ED), the task of identifying event mentions in

understanding in specialized domains. Understanding the complex event ontology,
extracting domain-specific triggers from the passage, and structuring them

reasoning framework that decouples the task of ED using Dreamer and Grounder.
Dreamer encourages divergent reasoning through open-ended event discovery,
which helps to boost event coverage. Conversely, Grounder introduces convergent
reasoning to align the free-form predictions with the task-specific
instructions using finite-state machine guided constrained decoding.
Additionally, an LLM-Judge verifies the final outputs to ensure high precision.
Through extensive experiments on six datasets across five domains and nine
LLMs, we demonstrate how DiCoRe consistently outperforms prior zero-shot,
transfer-learning, and reasoning baselines, achieving 4-7% average F1 gains
over the best baseline -- establishing DiCoRe as a strong zero-shot ED

Abstract      = {Software engineers typically interpret the domain description in natural
language and translate it into a conceptual model. Three approaches are used in
this domain modeling: textual languages, diagrammatic languages, and a mixed
based of text and diagrams. According to some researchers, relying on a
diagrammatic notation levies certain burdens for designing large models because
visual languages are intended to depict everything diagrammatically during a
development process but fail to do so for a lack of developer efficiency. It is
claimed that textual formats enable easier manipulation in editors and tools
and facilitate the integration of ontologies in software systems. In this
paper, we explore the problem of the relationship between textual format and
diagramming in conceptual modeling. The main focus is modeling based on the
so-called thinging machine (TM). Several examples are developed in detail to
contrast side-by-side targeted domains represented in textual description and
TM modeling. A TM model is defined as a thimac (thing/machine) with a time
feature that forms dynamic events over static thimacs utilizing five generic
actions: create, process, release, transfer, and receive. This provides a
conceptual foundation that can be simplified further by eliminating the actions
of release, transfer, and receive. A multilevel reduction in the TM diagram s
complexity can also be achieved by assuming diagrammatic notations represent
the actions of creation and processing. We envision that special tools will
help improve developer efficiency. The study s results of contrasting textual
and mix-based descriptions vs. TM modeling justify our claim that TM modeling
is a more appropriate methodology than other diagrammatic schemes (e.g., UML
classes) examined in this paper.},

nature of existing resources. This paper introduces a new collaborative,
open-access database specifically designed to address this gap by providing
standardized data on HTS materials and crucial auxiliary components for HTS
applications. The database encompasses extensive data on structural, cryogenic,
electrical, magnetic, and superconducting materials, supporting diverse
requirements from HTS modelling to magnet design. Developed through
collaborative efforts and organized using an ontology-driven data model, this
platform is dynamically adaptable, ensuring that it can grow as new materials
and data emerge. Key features include user-driven contributions, peer-reviewed
data validation, and advanced filtering capabilities for efficient data
retrieval. This innovative database, to the knowledge of the authors, being the
largest publicly available for material properties of HTS technologies is
positioned as a valuable tool for the HTS community, promoting more efficient
research and development processes, accelerating the practical application of
HTS, and fostering a collaborative approach to knowledge sharing within the
field. The database is available at https://sc.hi-scale.grisenergia.pt/app.},

Abstract      = {Transforming relational databases into knowledge graphs with enriched
ontologies enhances semantic interoperability and unlocks advanced graph-based
learning and reasoning over data. However, previous approaches either demand
significant manual effort to derive an ontology from a database schema or
produce only a basic ontology. We present RIGOR, Retrieval-augmented Iterative
Generation of RDB Ontologies, an LLM-driven approach that turns relational
schemas into rich OWL ontologies with minimal human effort. RIGOR combines
three sources via RAG, the database schema and its documentation, a repository
of domain ontologies, and a growing core ontology, to prompt a generative LLM
for producing successive, provenance-tagged delta ontology fragments. Each
fragment is refined by a judge-LLM before being merged into the core ontology,
and the process iterates table-by-table following foreign key constraints until
coverage is complete. Applied to real-world databases, our approach outputs
ontologies that score highly on standard quality dimensions such as accuracy,
completeness, conciseness, adaptability, clarity, and consistency, while
substantially reducing manual effort.},

Abstract      = {A defining feature of twenty first century engineering challenges is their
inherent complexity, demanding the convergence of knowledge across diverse
disciplines. Establishing consistent methodological foundations for engineering
systems remains a challenge -- one that both systems engineering and network
science have sought to address. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) has
recently emerged as a practical, interdisciplinary approach for developing
complex systems from concept through implementation. In contrast, network
science focuses on the quantitative analysis of networks present within
engineering systems. This paper introduces hetero-functional graph theory
(HFGT) as a conceptual bridge between these two fields, serving as a tutorial
for both communities. For systems engineers, HFGT preserves the heterogeneity
of conceptual and ontological constructs in MBSE, including system form,
function, and concept. For network scientists, it provides multiple graph-based
data structures enabling matrix-based quantitative analysis. The modeling
process begins with ontological foundations, defining an engineering system as
an abstraction and representing it with a model. Model fidelity is assessed
using four linguistic properties: soundness, completeness, lucidity, and
laconicity. A meta-architecture is introduced to manage the convergence
challenges between domain-specific reference architectures and case-specific
instantiations. Unlike other meta-architectures, HFGT is rooted in linguistic
structures, modeling resources as subjects, system processes as predicates, and
operands-such as matter, energy, organisms, information, and money-as objects.
These elements are integrated within a system meta-architecture expressed in
the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The paper concludes by offering guidance

discontinuity from discrete observations, unstructured memory representations,
and insufficient task understanding leading to navigation failures. We propose
DORAEMON (Decentralized Ontology-aware Reliable Agent with Enhanced Memory
Oriented Navigation), a novel cognitive-inspired framework consisting of
Ventral and Dorsal Streams that mimics human navigation capabilities. The
Dorsal Stream implements the Hierarchical Semantic-Spatial Fusion and Topology
Map to handle spatiotemporal discontinuities, while the Ventral Stream combines
RAG-VLM and Policy-VLM to improve decision-making. Our approach also develops
Nav-Ensurance to ensure navigation safety and efficiency. We evaluate DORAEMON
on the HM3D, MP3D, and GOAT datasets, where it achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both success rate (SR) and success weighted by path length (SPL)
metrics, significantly outperforming existing methods. We also introduce a new

Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
processing extensive offline datasets. However, they often face challenges in
acquiring and integrating complex, knowledge online. Traditional AI training
paradigms, predominantly based on supervised learning or reinforcement
learning, mirror a 'Piagetian' model of independent exploration. These
approaches typically rely on large datasets and sparse feedback signals,
limiting the models' ability to learn efficiently from interactions. Drawing
inspiration from Vygotsky's sociocultural theory, this study explores the
potential of socially mediated learning paradigms to address these limitations.
  We introduce a dynamic environment, termed the 'AI Social Gym', where an AI
learner agent engages in dyadic pedagogical dialogues with knowledgeable AI
teacher agents. These interactions emphasize external, structured dialogue as a
core mechanism for knowledge acquisition, contrasting with methods that depend
solely on internal inference or pattern recognition.
  Our investigation focuses on how different pedagogical strategies impact the
AI learning process in the context of ontology acquisition. Empirical results
indicate that such dialogic approaches-particularly those involving
mixed-direction interactions combining top-down explanations with
learner-initiated questioning-significantly enhance the LLM's ability to
acquire and apply new knowledge, outperforming both unidirectional
instructional methods and direct access to structured knowledge, formats
typically present in training datasets.
  These findings suggest that integrating pedagogical and psychological
insights into AI and robot training can substantially improve post-training
knowledge acquisition and response quality. This approach offers a
complementary pathway to existing strategies like prompt engineering},

Mamba (HiM), integrating efficient Mamba2 with exponential growth and curved
nature of hyperbolic geometry to learn hierarchy-aware language embeddings for
deeper linguistic understanding. Mamba2-processed sequences are projected to
the Poincare ball (via tangent-based mapping) or Lorentzian manifold (via
cosine and sine-based mapping) with "learnable" curvature, optimized with a
combined hyperbolic loss. Our HiM model facilitates the capture of relational
distances across varying hierarchical levels, enabling effective long-range
reasoning. This makes it well-suited for tasks like mixed-hop prediction and
multi-hop inference in hierarchical classification. We evaluated our HiM with
four linguistic and medical datasets for mixed-hop prediction and multi-hop
inference tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that: 1) Both HiM models
effectively capture hierarchical relationships for four ontological datasets,
surpassing Euclidean baselines. 2) HiM-Poincare captures fine-grained semantic
distinctions with higher h-norms, while HiM-Lorentz provides more stable,

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.AI},
Abstract      = {This paper introduces the Theory of the Unique Latent Pattern (ULP), a formal
epistemic framework that redefines the origin of apparent complexity in dynamic
systems. Rather than attributing unpredictability to intrinsic randomness or
emergent nonlinearity, ULP asserts that every analyzable system is governed by
a structurally unique, deterministic generative mechanism, one that remains
hidden not due to ontological indeterminacy, but due to epistemic constraints.
The theory is formalized using a non-universal generative mapping \(
\mathcal{F}_S(P_S, t) \), where each system \( S \) possesses its own latent
structure \( P_S \), irreducible and non-replicable across systems. Observed
irregularities are modeled as projections of this generative map through
observer-limited interfaces, introducing epistemic noise \( \varepsilon_S(t) \)
as a measure of incomplete access. By shifting the locus of uncertainty from
the system to the observer, ULP reframes chaos as a context-relative failure of
representation. We contrast this position with foundational paradigms in chaos
theory, complexity science, and statistical learning. While they assume or
model shared randomness or collective emergence, ULP maintains that every
instance harbors a singular structural identity. Although conceptual, the
theory satisfies the criterion of falsifiability in the Popperian sense, it
invites empirical challenge by asserting that no two systems governed by
distinct latent mechanisms will remain indistinguishable under sufficient
resolution. This opens avenues for structurally individuated models in AI,

Abstract      = {The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has resulted in
interest in their potential applications within manufacturing systems,
particularly in the context of Industry 5.0. However, determining when to
implement LLMs versus other Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques,
ontologies or knowledge graphs, remains an open question. This paper offers
decision-making guidance for selecting the most suitable technique in various
industrial contexts, emphasizing human-robot collaboration and resilience in
manufacturing. We examine the origins and unique strengths of LLMs, ontologies,
and knowledge graphs, assessing their effectiveness across different industrial
scenarios based on the number of domains or disciplines required to bring a
product from design to manufacture. Through this comparative framework, we
explore specific use cases where LLMs could enhance robotics for human-robot
collaboration, while underscoring the continued relevance of ontologies and
knowledge graphs in low-dependency or resource-constrained sectors.
Additionally, we address the practical challenges of deploying these
technologies, such as computational cost and interpretability, providing a
roadmap for manufacturers to navigate the evolving landscape of Language based
AI tools in Industry 5.0. Our findings offer a foundation for informed
decision-making, helping industry professionals optimize the use of Language
Based models for sustainable, resilient, and human-centric manufacturing. We
also propose a Large Knowledge Language Model architecture that offers the

Abstract      = {Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics

interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic

libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual
classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical
databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed
classification rules, or are deep learning methods that lack explainability.
  This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence
to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used
for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with
natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an
explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which
we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO).
  We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our
results against deep learning models and a naive SMARTS pattern based
classifier. C3PO outperforms the naive classifier, but does not reach the
performance of state of the art deep learning methods. However, C3PO has a
number of strengths that complement deep learning methods, including
explainability and reduced data dependence. C3PO can be used alongside deep
learning classifiers to provide an explanation of the classification, where
both methods agree. The programs can be used as part of the ontology
development process, and iteratively refined by expert human curators.},

Abstract      = {All aspects of our society, including the life sciences, need a mechanism for
people working within them to represent the concepts they employ to carry out
their research. For the information systems being designed and developed to
support researchers and scientists in conducting their work, conceptual models
of the relevant domains are usually designed as both blueprints for a system
being developed and as a means of communication between the designer and
developer. Most conceptual modelling concepts are generic in the sense that
they are applied with the same understanding across many applications. Problems
in the life sciences, however, are especially complex and important, because
they deal with humans, their well-being, and their interactions with the
environment as well as other organisms. This work proposes a systemist
perspective for creating a conceptual model of a life scientist's problem. We
introduce the notion of a system and then show how it can be applied to the
development of an information system for handling genomic-related information.
We extend our discussion to show how the proposed systemist perspective can
support the modelling of precision medicine. This research recognizes
challenges in life sciences research of how to model problems to better
represent the connections between physical and digital worlds. We propose a new
notation that explicitly incorporates systemist thinking, as well as the
components of systems based on recent ontological foundations. The new notation
captures important semantics in the domain of life sciences. It may be used to
facilitate understanding, communication and problem-solving more broadly. We
also provide a precise, sound, ontologically supported characterization of the
term system, as a basic construct for conceptual modelling in life sciences.},

Abstract      = {Recent reasoning-oriented LLMs have demonstrated strong performance on
challenging tasks such as mathematics and science examinations. However, core
cognitive faculties of human intelligence, such as abstract reasoning and
generalization, remain underexplored. To address this, we evaluate recent
reasoning-oriented LLMs on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)
benchmark, which explicitly demands both faculties. We formulate ARC as a
program synthesis task and propose nine candidate solvers. Experimental results
show that repeated-sampling planning-aided code generation (RSPC) achieves the
highest test accuracy and demonstrates consistent generalization across most
LLMs. To further improve performance, we introduce an ARC solver, Knowledge
Augmentation for Abstract Reasoning (KAAR), which encodes core knowledge priors
within an ontology that classifies priors into three hierarchical levels based
on their dependencies. KAAR progressively expands LLM reasoning capacity by
gradually augmenting priors at each level, and invokes RSPC to generate
candidate solutions after each augmentation stage. This stage-wise reasoning
reduces interference from irrelevant priors and improves LLM performance.
Empirical results show that KAAR maintains strong generalization and
consistently outperforms non-augmented RSPC across all evaluated LLMs,
achieving around 5% absolute gains and up to 64.52% relative improvement.
Despite these achievements, ARC remains a challenging benchmark for
reasoning-oriented LLMs, highlighting future avenues of progress in LLMs.},

implicit encoding of taxonomic structure. We analyze the consistency of these

documentation of design decisions for OntoGSN maintenance; a SPARQL query
library with automation patterns; and a prototypical interface. The ontology
strictly adheres to the standard's text and has been evaluated according to
FAIR principles, the OOPS framework, competency questions, and community

Abstract      = {[Objective] This study addresses key challenges in machine learning, namely
the absence of a unified formal theoretical framework and the lack of
foundational theories for model interpretability and ethical safety. [Methods]
We first construct a formal information model, explicitly defining the
ontological states and carrier mappings of typical machine learning stages
using sets of well-formed formulas. By introducing learnable and processable
predicates, as well as learning and processing functions, we analyze the causal
chain logic and constraint laws governing machine learning processes. [Results]
We establish the Machine Learning Theory Meta-Framework (MLT-MF), on which we
further propose universal definitions for model interpretability and ethical
safety. We prove and validate three key theorems: the relationship between
model interpretability and information existence, ethical safety assurance, and
the upper bound estimation of total variation distance (TVD). [Limitations] The
current framework assumes ideal, noise-free information enabling mappings and
focuses primarily on model learning and processing logic in static scenarios.
It does not yet address information fusion and conflict resolution across
ontological spaces in multimodal or multi-agent systems. [Conclusions] This
work overcomes the limitations of fragmented research and provides a unified
theoretical foundation for systematically addressing critical issues in

protein embeddings with text representations via contrastive loss. After the
alignment phase, we apply instruction-based fine-tuning using LoRA on the
decoder to teach the model how to generate accurate protein function
descriptions conditioned on the protein sequence. We train Prot2Text-V2 on
about 250K curated entries from SwissProt and evaluate it under low-homology

information from the main available public data sources, and c) enriching the
graph nodes with expressive feature vectors such as molecular fingerprints and
gene ontologies. Biologically and chemically relevant features improve the
capacity of machine learning models to generate accurate and well-structured

biological knowledge graph that serves as a state-of-the-art platform to

while maintaining high standards regarding safety and reliability. In this
environment, with an enormous potential for re-use and adaptation of existing
solutions and methods, Knowledge-Based Engineering (KBE) has been applied for
decades. The objective of this study is to identify and examine
state-of-the-art knowledge management practices in the field of aerospace
engineering. Our contributions include: 1) A SWARM-SLR of over 1,000 articles
with qualitative analysis of 164 selected articles, supported by two aerospace
engineering domain expert surveys. 2) A knowledge graph of over 700
knowledge-based aerospace engineering processes, software, and data, formalized
in the interoperable Web Ontology Language (OWL) and mapped to Wikidata entries
where possible. The knowledge graph is represented on the Open Research
Knowledge Graph (ORKG), and an aerospace Wikibase, for reuse and continuation
of structuring aerospace engineering knowledge exchange. 3) Our resulting
intermediate and final artifacts of the knowledge synthesis, available as a
Zenodo dataset. This review sets a precedent for structured, semantic-based
approaches to managing aerospace engineering knowledge. By advancing these
principles, research, and industry can achieve more efficient design processes,
enhanced collaboration, and a stronger commitment to sustainable aviation.},

Abstract      = {Taiwanese China Studies (CS) has developed into a rich, interdisciplinary
research field shaped by the unique geopolitical position and long standing
academic engagement with Mainland China. This study responds to the growing
need to systematically revisit and reorganize decades of Taiwan based CS
scholarship by proposing an AI assisted approach that transforms unstructured
academic texts into structured, interactive knowledge representations. We apply
generative AI (GAI) techniques and large language models (LLMs) to extract and
standardize entity relation triples from 1,367 peer reviewed CS articles
published between 1996 and 2019. These triples are then visualized through a
lightweight D3.js based system, forming the foundation of a domain specific
knowledge graph and vector database for the field. This infrastructure allows
users to explore conceptual nodes and semantic relationships across the corpus,
revealing previously uncharted intellectual trajectories, thematic clusters,
and research gaps. By decomposing textual content into graph structured
knowledge units, our system enables a paradigm shift from linear text
consumption to network based knowledge navigation. In doing so, it enhances
scholarly access to CS literature while offering a scalable, data driven
alternative to traditional ontology construction. This work not only
demonstrates how generative AI can augment area studies and digital humanities
but also highlights its potential to support a reimagined scholarly
infrastructure for regional knowledge systems.},

Abstract      = {The pursuit of advanced polymers for energy technologies, spanning
photovoltaics, solid-state batteries, and hydrogen storage, is hindered by
fragmented data ecosystems that fail to capture the hierarchical complexity of
these materials. Polymer science lacks interoperable databases, forcing
reliance on disconnected literature and legacy records riddled with
unstructured formats and irreproducible testing protocols. This fragmentation
stifles machine learning (ML) applications and delays the discovery of
materials critical for global decarbonization. Three systemic barriers compound
the challenge. First, academic-industrial data silos restrict access to
proprietary industrial datasets, while academic publications often omit
critical synthesis details. Second, inconsistent testing methods undermine
cross-study comparability. Third, incomplete metadata in existing databases
limits their utility for training reliable ML models. Emerging solutions
address these gaps through technological and collaborative innovation. Natural
language processing (NLP) tools extract structured polymer data from decades of
literature, while high-throughput robotic platforms generate self-consistent
datasets via autonomous experimentation. Central to these advances is the
adoption of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles,
adapted to polymer-specific ontologies, ensuring machine-readability and
reproducibility. Future breakthroughs hinge on cultural shifts toward open
science, accelerated by decentralized data markets and autonomous laboratories
that merge robotic experimentation with real-time ML validation. By addressing
data fragmentation through technological innovation, collaborative governance,
and ethical stewardship, the polymer community can transform bottlenecks into
accelerants.},

interact with the network, each with its own specialized needs and domain
language. Creating semantic languages (i.e., ontology-based languages) and
associating them with each application to facilitate intent translation lacks
technical expertise and is neither practical nor scalable. To tackle the
aforementioned problem, we propose a context-aware AI framework that utilizes
machine reasoning (MR), retrieval augmented generation (RAG), and generative AI
technologies to interpret intents from different applications and generate
structured network intents. The proposed framework allows for
generalized/domain-specific intent expression and overcomes the drawbacks of
large language models (LLMs) and vanilla-RAG framework. The experimental
results show that our proposed intent-RAG framework outperforms the LLM and
vanilla-RAG framework in intent translation.},

Abstract      = {Industries such as banking, telecom, and airlines - o6en have large so6ware
systems that are several decades old. Many of these systems are written in old
programming languages such as COBOL, PL/1, Assembler, etc. In many cases, the
documentation is not updated, and those who developed/designed these systems
are no longer around. Understanding these systems for either modernization or
even regular maintenance has been a challenge. An extensive application may
have natural boundaries based on its code dependencies and architecture. There
are also other logical boundaries in an enterprise setting driven by business
functions, data domains, etc. Due to these complications, the system architects
generally plan their modernization across these logical boundaries in parts,
thereby adopting an incremental approach for the modernization journey of the
entire system. In this work, we present a so6ware system analysis tool that
allows a subject ma=er expert (SME) or system architect to analyze a large
so6ware system incrementally. We analyze the source code and other artifacts
(such as data schema) to create a knowledge graph using a customizable
ontology/schema. Entities and relations in our ontology can be defined for any
combination of programming languages and platforms. Using this knowledge graph,
the analyst can then define logical boundaries around dependent Entities (e.g.
Programs, Transactions, Database Tables etc.). Our tool then presents different
views showcasing the dependencies from the newly defined boundary to/from the
other logical groups of the system. This exercise is repeated interactively to
1) Identify the Entities and groupings of interest for a modernization task and
2) Understand how a change in one part of the system may affect the other
parts. To validate the efficacy of our tool, we provide an initial study of our
system on two client applications.},

Abstract      = {Having shortly reviewed our idea of the grand unified SU(5) being only exact
in a classical limit, in a truly existing lattice, an ontological lattice, we
go over to putting a series of different physical energy scales such the
approximate unification scale for the SU(5)(without any SUSY), the Planck
scale, and e.g. the scale of see-saw neutrino masses into a certain plot
showing the energy scales on a straight line. This straight line of this plot
supposed to result from such an ontological lattice, that fluctuates in link
size a and lattice density in a very strong way according to a log normal
distribution. The point is that different energy scales result from the link
size of the lattice to different powers, like the averages a to the n th ,
where the power n depends on the type of scale considered. Since the n th root
of the average of the n th power of the link size in the fluctuating lattice is
very strongly dependent on the power n, because of very huge fluctuations, the
different types of physical energy scales can get very different. With a Galton
i.e. log normal distribution of the link size the various energy scales have
their logarithms fall into a nice straight line versus the power of the link
size, on which they depend. Our model gives a surprisingly good number for the
small deviations of the experimental electron-and muon-anomalous magnetic
moment from the pure Standard Model value.},

on our ongoing work on designing a digital twin to enhance resource planning,
e.g., for the in-patient ward needs in hospitals. By leveraging executable
formal models for system exploration, ontologies for knowledge representation
and an SMT solver for constraint satisfiability, our approach aims to explore
hypothetical "what-if" scenarios to improve strategic planning processes, as
well as to solve concrete, short-term decision-making tasks. Our proposed
solution uses the executable formal model to turn a stream of arriving
patients, that need to be hospitalized, into a stream of optimization problems,
e.g., capturing daily inpatient ward needs, that can be solved by SMT
techniques. The knowledge base, which formalizes domain knowledge, is used to
model the needed configuration in the digital twin, allowing the twin to
support both short-term decision-making and long-term strategic planning by
generating scenarios spanning average-case as well as worst-case resource
needs, depending on the expected treatment of patients, as well as ranging over
variations in available resources, e.g., bed distribution in different rooms.
We illustrate our digital twin architecture by considering the problem of bed
bay allocation in a hospital ward.},

Abstract      = {In this paper, we introduce KERAIA, a novel framework and software platform
for symbolic knowledge engineering designed to address the persistent
challenges of representing, reasoning with, and executing knowledge in dynamic,
complex, and context-sensitive environments. The central research question that
motivates this work is: How can unstructured, often tacit, human expertise be
effectively transformed into computationally tractable algorithms that AI
systems can efficiently utilise? KERAIA seeks to bridge this gap by building on
foundational concepts such as Minsky's frame-based reasoning and K-lines, while
introducing significant innovations. These include Clouds of Knowledge for
dynamic aggregation, Dynamic Relations (DRels) for context-sensitive
inheritance, explicit Lines of Thought (LoTs) for traceable reasoning, and
Cloud Elaboration for adaptive knowledge transformation. This approach moves
beyond the limitations of traditional, often static, knowledge representation
paradigms. KERAIA is designed with Explainable AI (XAI) as a core principle,
ensuring transparency and interpretability, particularly through the use of
LoTs. The paper details the framework's architecture, the KSYNTH representation
language, and the General Purpose Paradigm Builder (GPPB) to integrate diverse
inference methods within a unified structure. We validate KERAIA's versatility,
expressiveness, and practical applicability through detailed analysis of
multiple case studies spanning naval warfare simulation, industrial diagnostics
in water treatment plants, and strategic decision-making in the game of RISK.
Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis against established knowledge
representation paradigms (including ontologies, rule-based systems, and
knowledge graphs) and discuss the implementation aspects and computational
considerations of the KERAIA platform.},

graphs from simple similarity measures, while graph-native explainers are rare;
post-hoc methods adapted from non-graph domains such as gradient saliency, and
SHAP predominate. We group existing approaches into four interpretability
families, outline trends such as graph-in-graph hierarchies, knowledge-graph
edges, and dynamic topology learning, and perform a practical benchmark. Using
an Alzheimer disease cohort, we compare Sensitivity Analysis, Gradient
Saliency, SHAP and Graph Masking. SHAP and Sensitivity Analysis recover the
broadest set of known AD pathways and Gene-Ontology terms, whereas Gradient
Saliency and Graph Masking surface complementary metabolic and transport
signatures. Permutation tests show all four beat random gene sets, but with
distinct trade-offs: SHAP and Graph Masking offer deeper biology at higher
compute cost, while Gradient Saliency and Sensitivity Analysis are quicker

the automatic rewriting of SPARQL queries from a source ontology to a target

the principles of equivalence transitivity as well as the advanced capabilities

Abstract      = {Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems in the legal domain face a
critical challenge: standard, flat-text retrieval is blind to the hierarchical,
diachronic, and causal structure of law, leading to anachronistic and
unreliable answers. This paper introduces an ontology-driven Graph RAG
framework designed to overcome these limitations. We ground our knowledge graph
in a formal, LRMoo-inspired model that distinguishes abstract legal Works from
their versioned Expressions. We model temporal states as efficient aggregations
that reuse the versioned expressions (CTVs) of unchanged components, and we
reify legislative events as first-class Action nodes to make causality explicit
and queryable. This structured backbone enables a unified, planner-guided query
strategy that applies explicit policies to deterministically resolve complex
requests for (i) point-in-time retrieval, (ii) hierarchical impact analysis,
and (iii) auditable provenance reconstruction. Through a case study on the
Brazilian Constitution, we demonstrate how this approach provides a verifiable,
temporally-correct substrate for LLMs, enabling higher-order analytical
capabilities while drastically reducing the risk of factual errors. The result
is a practical framework for building more trustworthy and explainable legal AI
systems.},

Abstract      = {The Heisenberg microscope provides a powerful mental image of the measurement
process of quantum mechanics (QM), attempting to explain the uncertainty
relation through an uncontrollable back-action from the measurement device.
However, Heisenberg's proposed back-action uses features that are not present
in the QM description of the world, and according to Bohr not present in the
world. Therefore, Bohr argues, the mental image proposed by Heisenberg should
be avoided. Later developments by Bell and Kochen-Specker shows that a model
that contains the features used for the Heisenberg microscope is in principle
possible but must necessarily be nonlocal and contextual. In this paper we will
re-examine the measurement process within a restriction of QM known as
Stabilizer QM, that still exhibits for example Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger
nonlocality and Peres-Mermin contextuality. The re-examination will use a
recent extension of stabilizer QM, the Contextual Ontological Model (COM),
where the system state gives a complete description of future measurement
outcomes reproducing the quantum predictions, including the mentioned
phenomena. We will see that the resulting contextual Heisenberg microscope
back-action can be completely described within COM, and that the associated
randomness originates in the initial state of the pointer system, exactly as in
the original description of the Heisenberg microscope. The presence of
contextuality, usually seen as prohibiting ontological models, suggests that
the contextual Heisenberg microscope picture can be enabled in general QM.},

theories focus on individual states, often relying on hedonistic, desire

cases where individual sacrifices contribute to broader social progress, a
critical challenge in modeling group flourishing. To address this, the paper
refines and extends the Counterfactual Account (CT) of well being, which
evaluates goodness of an event by comparing an individual's actual well being
with a hypothetical counterpart in a nearby possible world. While useful, this
framework is insufficient for group level ontologies, where well being depends
on functional persistence, institutional roles, and historical impact rather
than immediate individual outcomes. Drawing on Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the
paper introduces a model in which group flourishing is evaluated in terms of
group functional, where members bear roles and exhibit persistence conditions
akin to biological systems or designed artifacts. This approach enables
semantic interoperability for modeling longitudinal social contributions,
allowing for structured reasoning about group welfare, social institutions, and
group flourishing over time.},

Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities across
various domains, yet they struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks in areas that
demand factual accuracy, e.g. industrial automation and healthcare. Key
limitations include their tendency to hallucinate, lack of source traceability

models with knowledge graphs (GraphRAG) offers promising avenues for overcoming
these deficits. However, a major challenge lies in creating such a knowledge
graph in the first place. Here, we propose a novel approach that combines LLMs
with a tripartite knowledge graph representation, which is constructed by
connecting complex, domain-specific objects via a curated ontology of
corresponding, domain-specific concepts to relevant sections within chunks of
text through a concept-anchored pre-analysis of source documents starting from
an initial lexical graph. Subsequently, we formulate LLM prompt creation as an
unsupervised node classification problem allowing for the optimization of
information density, coverage, and arrangement of LLM prompts at significantly
reduced lengths. An initial experimental evaluation of our approach on a
healthcare use case, involving multi-faceted analyses of patient anamneses
given a set of medical concepts as well as a series of clinical guideline

Abstract      = {Urban street environments are vital to supporting human activity in public
spaces. The emergence of big data, such as street view images (SVIs) combined
with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), is transforming how researchers
and practitioners investigate, measure, and evaluate semantic and visual
elements of urban environments. Considering the low threshold for creating
automated evaluative workflows using MLLMs, it is crucial to explore both the
risks and opportunities associated with these probabilistic models. In
particular, the extent to which the integration of expert knowledge can
influence the performance of MLLMs in evaluating the quality of urban design
has not been fully explored. This study sets out an initial exploration of how
integrating more formal and structured representations of expert urban design
knowledge into the input prompts of an MLLM (ChatGPT-4) can enhance the model's
capability and reliability in evaluating the walkability of built environments
using SVIs. We collect walkability metrics from the existing literature and
categorize them using relevant ontologies. We then select a subset of these
metrics, focusing on the subthemes of pedestrian safety and attractiveness, and
develop prompts for the MLLM accordingly. We analyze the MLLM's ability to
evaluate SVI walkability subthemes through prompts with varying levels of
clarity and specificity regarding evaluation criteria. Our experiments
demonstrate that MLLMs are capable of providing assessments and interpretations
based on general knowledge and can support the automation of multimodal
image-text evaluations. However, they generally provide more optimistic scores
and can make mistakes when interpreting the provided metrics, resulting in
incorrect evaluations. By integrating expert knowledge, the MLLM's evaluative
performance exhibits higher consistency and concentration.},

language models trained on our multi-agent distilled datasets achieve notable
improvements in biomedical question-answering tasks, outperforming both strong

Abstract      = {Semantic reasoning aims to infer new knowledge from existing knowledge, with

A key challenge in semantic reasoning is verifying ontology consistency.
However, state-of-the-art reasoners are computationally expensive, and their
efficiency decreases as ontology sizes grow. While classical machine learning
models have been explored for consistency checking, they struggle to capture
complex relationships within ontologies. Large language models (LLMs) have
shown promising results for simple reasoning tasks but perform poorly on
structured reasoning. The recently introduced Graph Language Model (GLM) offers
a way to simultaneously process graph-structured data and text. This paper
proposes GLaMoR (Graph Language Model for Reasoning), a reasoning pipeline that
transforms OWL ontologies into graph-structured data and adapts the GLM
architecture for consistency checking. We evaluate GLaMoR on ontologies from
the NCBO BioPortal repository, converting them into triples suitable for model
input. Our results show that the GLM outperforms all baseline models, achieving
$95\%$ accuracy while being 20 times faster than classical reasoners.

for an analysis we define an ontology for SPAs. The analysis is, then, based on
an encoding of the preconditions for the execution of the clauses of an SPA, as
well as on a set of proposed consistency constraints formalized using decidable
fragments of First-Order Logic (FOL). Based on the ontology for SPAs, textual
SPAs are first encoded in a structured natural language format that we refer to
as ``blocks''. ContractCheck interprets these blocks and constraints and
translates them into assertions formulated in FOL. It then invokes a
Satisfiability Modulo Theory (SMT) solver in order to check the executability
of a considered contract, either by providing a satisfying model, or by proving
the existence of conflicting clauses that prevent the contract from being
executed. We illustrate the application of ContractCheck to concrete SPAs,
including one example of an SPA of realistic size and complexity, and conclude
by suggesting directions for future research.},

VEU-Bench (Video Editing Understanding Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark

multimodal imaging data, particularly in chest X-ray (CXR) evaluations, albeit
their performance hinges on how well image and text representations are
aligned. Existing alignment methods, predominantly based on contrastive
learning, prioritize separation between disease classes over segregation of
fine-grained pathology attributes like location, size or severity, leading to
suboptimal representations. Here, we propose MedTrim (Meta-entity-driven
Triplet mining), a novel method that enhances image-text alignment through
multimodal triplet learning synergistically guided by disease class as well as
adjectival and directional pathology descriptors. Unlike common alignment
methods that separate broad disease classes, MedTrim leverages structured
meta-entity information to preserve subtle but clinically significant
intra-class variations. For this purpose, we first introduce an ontology-based
entity recognition module that extracts pathology-specific meta-entities from
CXR reports, as annotations on pathology attributes are rare in public
datasets. For refined sample selection in triplet mining, we then introduce a
novel score function that captures an aggregate measure of inter-sample
similarity based on disease classes and adjectival/directional descriptors.
Lastly, we introduce a multimodal triplet alignment objective for explicit
within- and cross-modal alignment between samples sharing detailed pathology
characteristics. Our demonstrations indicate that MedTrim improves performance
in downstream retrieval and classification tasks compared to state-of-the-art
alignment methods.},

Abstract      = {Intellectual Property (IP) management involves strategically protecting and
utilizing intellectual assets to enhance organizational innovation,
competitiveness, and value creation. Patent matching is a crucial task in
intellectual property management, which facilitates the organization and
utilization of patents. Existing models often rely on the emergent capabilities
of Large Language Models (LLMs) and leverage them to identify related patents
directly. However, these methods usually depend on matching keywords and
overlook the hierarchical classification and categorical relationships of
patents. In this paper, we propose MemGraph, a method that augments the patent
matching capabilities of LLMs by incorporating a memory graph derived from
their parametric memory. Specifically, MemGraph prompts LLMs to traverse their
memory to identify relevant entities within patents, followed by attributing
these entities to corresponding ontologies. After traversing the memory graph,
we utilize extracted entities and ontologies to improve the capability of LLM
in comprehending the semantics of patents. Experimental results on the
PatentMatch dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of MemGraph, achieving a
17.68% performance improvement over baseline LLMs. The further analysis
highlights the generalization ability of MemGraph across various LLMs, both
in-domain and out-of-domain, and its capacity to enhance the internal reasoning
processes of LLMs during patent matching. All data and codes are available at

Abstract      = {This paper presents a novel research analytical IT system grounded in Martin
Heidegger's Fundamental Ontology, distinguishing between beings (das Seiende)
and Being (das Sein). The system employs two modally distinct, descriptively
complete languages: a categorical language of beings for processing user inputs
and an existential language of Being for internal analysis. These languages are
bridged via a phenomenological reduction module, enabling the system to analyze
user queries (including questions, answers, and dialogues among IT
specialists), identify recursive and self-referential structures, and provide
actionable insights in categorical terms. Unlike contemporary systems limited
to categorical analysis, this approach leverages Heidegger's phenomenological
existential analysis to uncover deeper ontological patterns in query
processing, aiding in resolving logical traps in complex interactions, such as
metaphor usage in IT contexts. The path to full realization involves
formalizing the language of Being by a research team based on Heidegger's
Fundamental Ontology; given the existing completeness of the language of
beings, this reduces the system's computability to completeness, paving the way
for a universal query analysis tool. The paper presents the system's
architecture, operational principles, technical implementation, use

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Discovery gene-disease links is important in biology and medicine areas,
enabling disease identification and drug repurposing. Machine learning
approaches accelerate this process by leveraging biological knowledge
represented in ontologies and the structure of knowledge graphs. Still, many
existing works overlook ontologies explicitly representing diseases, missing
causal and semantic relationships between them. The gene-disease association
problem naturally frames itself as a link prediction task, where embedding
algorithms directly predict associations by exploring the structure and
properties of the knowledge graph. Some works frame it as a node-pair
classification task, combining embedding algorithms with traditional machine
learning algorithms. This strategy aligns with the logic of a machine learning
pipeline. However, the use of negative examples and the lack of validated
gene-disease associations to train embedding models may constrain its
effectiveness. This work introduces a novel framework for comparing the
performance of link prediction versus node-pair classification tasks, analyses
the performance of state of the art gene-disease association approaches, and
compares the different order-based formalizations of gene-disease association
prediction. It also evaluates the impact of the semantic richness through a
disease-specific ontology and additional links between ontologies. The
framework involves five steps: data splitting, knowledge graph integration,
embedding, modeling and prediction, and method evaluation. Results show that
enriching the semantic representation of diseases slightly improves
performance, while additional links generate a greater impact. Link prediction
methods better explore the semantic richness encoded in knowledge graphs.
Although node-pair classification methods identify all true positives, link
prediction methods outperform overall.},

When inconsistencies between LLM outputs and the ontology are detected, the
system generates explanatory feedback to guide the LLM towards a corrected,
logically coherent response in an iterative refinement loop. We present a
working Python prototype demonstrating this pipeline. Experimental results in a

Therefore, this paper proposes a set of requirements and task-specific metrics
for evaluating the fitness of ontologies for question generation tasks in
pedagogical settings. Using the ROMEO methodology (a structured framework used
for identifying task-specific metrics), a set of evaluation metrics have been
derived from an expert assessment of questions generated by a question
generation model. To validate the proposed metrics, we apply them to a set of
ontologies previously used in question generation to illustrate how the metric
scores align with and complement findings reported in earlier studies. The
analysis confirms that ontology characteristics significantly impact the
effectiveness of question generation, with different ontologies exhibiting
varying performance levels. This highlights the importance of assessing

the FlexOffer (FOs) model has been designed, to provide device-independent

long time horizons and many devices. An important aspect of the real-life
implementation of energy flexibility is enabling flexible data exchange with
many types of smart energy appliances and market systems, e.g., in smart

However, the current industry standard ontology for integrating smart devices

the risk of misleading or unsafe guidance. CyberBOT has been deployed in a
large graduate-level course at Arizona State University (ASU), where more than
one hundred students actively engage with the system through a dedicated
web-based platform. Computational evaluations in lab environments highlight the
potential capacity of CyberBOT, and a forthcoming field study will evaluate its
pedagogical impact. By integrating structured domain reasoning with modern
generative capabilities, CyberBOT illustrates a promising direction for
developing reliable and curriculum-aligned AI applications in specialized
educational contexts.},

interval [a,b] under the paradigm of fractal countability. Instead of assuming
the continuum as a completed uncountable totality, we model [a,b] as a layered
structure of constructively definable points, indexed by a hierarchy of formal
systems. We reformulate classical notions from real analysis -- continuity,
measure, differentiation, and integration -- in terms of stratified
definability levels S_n, thereby grounding the analytic apparatus in syntactic
accessibility rather than ontological postulation. The result is a framework
for fractal analysis, in which mathematical operations are relativized to
layers of expressibility, enabling new insights into approximation,
computability, and formal verification.},

Abstract      = {The integration of heterogeneous multi-omics datasets at a systems level
remains a central challenge for developing analytical and computational models
in precision cancer diagnostics. This paper introduces Multi-Omics Graph
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (MOGKAN), a deep learning framework that utilizes
messenger-RNA, micro-RNA sequences, and DNA methylation samples together with
Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) networks for cancer classification across 31
different cancer types. The proposed approach combines differential gene
expression with DESeq2, Linear Models for Microarray (LIMMA), and Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression to reduce
multi-omics data dimensionality while preserving relevant biological features.
The model architecture is based on the Kolmogorov-Arnold theorem principle and
uses trainable univariate functions to enhance interpretability and feature
analysis. MOGKAN achieves classification accuracy of 96.28 percent and exhibits
low experimental variability in comparison to related deep learning-based
models. The biomarkers identified by MOGKAN were validated as cancer-related
markers through Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) enrichment analysis. By integrating multi-omics data with graph-based
deep learning, our proposed approach demonstrates robust predictive performance
and interpretability with potential to enhance the translation of complex

Abstract      = {Ontologies enable knowledge sharing and interdisciplinary collaboration by

logical axioms are a cornerstone of ontology design, natural language elements

in ontologies and how it can be effectively represented and communicated,
addressing challenges such as indeterminacy of reference and meaning holism. To
this end, instead of following the conventional approach of beginning with
existing ontologies and working toward alignment or modularization, this
article proposes a reversal of perspective: taking the ontological term as the
starting point and introducing a new structure, named 'ontological unit',
characterized by: a term-centered design; enhanced characterization of both
formal and natural language statements; and an operationalizable definition of
communicated meaning based on general assertions. By formalizing the meaning of
ontological units, this work seeks to enhance the semantic robustness of terms,
improving their clarity and accessibility across domains. Furthermore, it may
offer a more effective foundation for ontology generation and significantly
improves support for key maintenance tasks such as reuse and versioning. This

challenges, this research work presents an Ontology based Complex Event
Processing (OCEP) framework, which utilizes semantic reasoning and Big Data
Analytics to improve event driven decision support. The proposed OCEP
architecture utilizes ontologies to support reasoning to event streams. It
ensures compatibility with different data sources and lets you find the events
based on the context. The Resource Description Framework (RDF) organizes event
data, and SPARQL query enables rapid event reasoning and retrieval. The
approach is implemented within the Hadoop environment, which consists of Hadoop
Distributed File System (HDFS) for scalable storage and Apache Kafka for
real-time CEP based event execution. We perform a real-time healthcare analysis
and case study to validate the model, utilizing IoT sensor data for illness
monitoring and emergency responses. This OCEP framework successfully integrates
several event streams, leading to improved early disease detection and aiding
doctors in decision-making. The result shows that OCEP predicts event detection
with an accuracy of 85%. This research work utilizes an OCEP to solve the

schema inference systems focus more on XML, JSON or RDF data, and often rely on

limited exploitation of the semantics of the text across a table. Motivated by
recent works on taxonomy completion and construction using Large Language
Models (LLMs), this paper presents two LLM-based methods for taxonomy inference
for tables: (i) EmTT which embeds columns by fine-tuning with contrastive
learning encoder-alone LLMs like BERT and utilises clustering for hierarchy
construction, and (ii) GeTT which generates table entity types and their
hierarchy by iterative prompting using a decoder-alone LLM like GPT-4.
Extensive evaluation on three real-world datasets with six metrics covering
different aspects of the output taxonomies has demonstrated that EmTT and GeTT
can both produce taxonomies with strong consistency relative to the Ground

reasoning processes. We begin by defining key capabilities for Physical AI
reasoning, with a focus on physical common sense and embodied reasoning. To
represent physical common sense, we use a hierarchical ontology that captures
fundamental knowledge about space, time, and physics. For embodied reasoning,
we rely on a two-dimensional ontology that generalizes across different
physical embodiments. Building on these capabilities, we develop two multimodal
large language models, Cosmos-Reason1-7B and Cosmos-Reason1-56B. We curate data
and train our models in two stages: Physical AI supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and Physical AI reinforcement learning (RL). To evaluate our models, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for physical common sense and embodied reasoning
according to our ontologies. Evaluation results show that Physical AI SFT and

Abstract      = {Background: Several studies show that large language models (LLMs) struggle
with phenotype-driven gene prioritization for rare diseases. These studies
typically use Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms to prompt foundation models
like GPT and LLaMA to predict candidate genes. However, in real-world settings,
foundation models are not optimized for domain-specific tasks like clinical
diagnosis, yet inputs are unstructured clinical notes rather than standardized
terms. How LLMs can be instructed to predict candidate genes or disease
diagnosis from unstructured clinical notes remains a major challenge. Methods:
We introduce RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG, two methods that combine
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze
clinical notes. A five-question CoT protocol mimics expert reasoning, while RAG
retrieves data from sources like HPO and OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in
Man). We evaluated these approaches on rare disease datasets, including 5,980
Phenopacket-derived notes, 255 literature-based narratives, and 220 in-house
clinical notes from Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia. Results: We found that
recent foundations models, including Llama 3.3-70B-Instruct and
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B, outperformed earlier versions such as Llama 2
and GPT-3.5. We also showed that RAG-driven CoT and CoT-driven RAG both
outperform foundation models in candidate gene prioritization from clinical
notes; in particular, both methods with DeepSeek backbone resulted in a top-10
gene accuracy of over 40% on Phenopacket-derived clinical notes. RAG-driven CoT
works better for high-quality notes, where early retrieval can anchor the
subsequent reasoning steps in domain-specific evidence, while CoT-driven RAG
has advantage when processing lengthy and noisy notes.},

purpose of the ontology is to assist in modelling the physical phenomenon of
interest in a veridical manner, while capturing the necessary and reusable

extending an existing upper ontology, Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), to define
lower-level terms of PSO. PSO has two parts: PSO-Physics, which consists of
terms and relations used to model physical phenomena based on the perspective
of classical mechanics involving partial differential equations, and PSO-Sim,
which consists of terms used to represent the information artefacts that are
about the physical phenomena modelled with PSO-Physics. The former terms are
used to model the physical phenomenon of interest independent of
solver-specific interpretations, which can be reused across different solvers,
while the latter terms are used to instantiate solver-specific input data. A
case study involving two simulation solvers was conducted to demonstrate this
capability of PSO. Discussion around the benefits and limitations of using BFO
for the current work is also provided, which should be valuable for any future
work that extends an existing upper ontology to develop ontologies for

normalized competencies from multiple documents (such as policy files and
curricula vitae) and creates strong relationships between recognized
competencies, occupation profiles, and related learning courses. To validate
its performance, we conducted a multi-tier evaluation that included both
explicit and implicit skill references in synthetic and real-world documents.
The results showed near-human-level accuracy, with F1 scores exceeding 0.95 for
explicit skill detection and above 0.93 for implicit mentions. The system
thereby establishes a sound foundation for supporting in-depth collaboration
across the AE4RIA network. The methodology involves a multi-stage pipeline
based on extensive preprocessing and data cleaning, semantic embedding and
segmentation via SentenceTransformer, and skill extraction using a FAISS-based
search method. The extracted skills are associated with occupation frameworks
(as formulated in the ESCO ontology) and with learning paths offered through
the Sustainable Development Goals Academy. Moreover, interactive visualization
software, implemented with Dash and Plotly, presents graphs and tables for
real-time exploration and informed decision-making by those involved in
policymaking, training and learning supply, career transitions, and

effective at oncology-specific tasks, such as named entity recognition (e.g.,
identifying cancer diagnoses), entity linking (e.g., linking entities to
standardized ontologies), TNM staging, document classification (e.g., cancer
subtype classification from pathology reports), and treatment response
prediction. Our framework emphasizes adaptability and resource efficiency. We
include minimal German instructions, collected at the University Hospital
Zurich (USZ), to test whether small amounts of non-English language data can
effectively transfer knowledge across languages. This approach mirrors our
motivation for lightweight models, which balance strong performance with
reduced computational costs, making them suitable for resource-limited

To retrieve information from the text corpus we implement a traditional vector

approaches for automatically constructing KGs and retrieving the relevant
subgraphs. In addition to these corpus approaches, we develop a novel
ontology-based framework for constructing knowledge graphs (KGs) from GDELT
directly which leverages the underlying schema of GDELT to create structured
representations of global events. For retrieving relevant information from the
ontology-based KGs we implement both direct graph queries and state-of-the-art
graph retrieval approaches. We compare the performance of each method in a
question-answering task. We find that while our ontology-based KGs are valuable
for question-answering, automated extraction of the relevant subgraphs is
challenging. Conversely, LLM-generated KGs, while capturing event summaries,
often lack consistency and interpretability. Our findings suggest benefits of a
synergistic approach between ontology and LLM-based KG construction, with

Abstract      = {Compliance with the GDPR privacy regulation places a significant burden on
organisations regarding the handling of personal data. The perceived efforts
and risks of complying with the GDPR further increase when data processing
activities span across organisational boundaries, as is the case in both
small-scale data sharing settings and in large-scale international data spaces.
  This paper addresses these concerns by proposing a case-generic method for
automated normative reasoning that establishes legal arguments for the
lawfulness of data processing activities. The arguments are established on the
basis of case-specific legal qualifications made by privacy experts, bringing
the human in the loop. The obtained expert system promotes transparency and
accountability, remains adaptable to extended or altered interpretations of the
GDPR, and integrates into novel or existing distributed data processing
systems.
  This result is achieved by defining a formal ontology and semantics for
automated normative reasoning based on an analysis of the purpose-limitation
principle of the GDPR. The ontology and semantics are implemented in eFLINT, a
domain-specific language for specifying and reasoning with norms. The XACML
architecture standard, applicable to both access and usage control, is
extended, demonstrating how GDPR-based normative reasoning can integrate into
(existing, distributed) systems for data processing. The resulting system is
designed and critically assessed in reference to requirements extracted from
the GPDR.},

Eprint        = {2503.05884v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {quant-ph},
Abstract      = {There is a received wisdom about where to draw the boundary between classical
and nonclassical for various types of quantum processes. For instance, for
multipartite states, it is the divide between separable and entangled, for
channels, the divide between entanglement-breaking and not, for sets of
measurements, the divide between compatible and incompatible, and for
assemblages, the divide between steerable and unsteerable. However, no unified
justification of these placements of the classical-nonclassical divide has been
proposed. That is, although each might be motivated by some notion of what it
means to be classically explainable, it is not the same notion for all of them.
One well-motivated notion of classical explainability is the one based on
generalized noncontextuality: a set of circuits is classically explainable if
the statistics they generate can be realized by a generalized-noncontextual
ontological model. In this work, we show that this notion can be leveraged to
define a classical-nonclassical divide for individual quantum processes of
arbitrary type. A set of measurements is judged to be classical if and only if
a particular set of circuits -- the one obtained by contracting these
measurements with every possible quantum state -- is classically explainable in
the sense just articulated. We begin the task of characterizing where the
classical-nonclassical divide lies according to this proposal for a variety of
different types of processes. In particular, we show that all of the following
are judged to be nonclassical: every entangled state, every set of incompatible
measurements, every non-entanglement-breaking channel, every steerable
assemblage. However, it also judges certain subsets of the complementary
classes to be nonclassical, i.e., certain separable states, compatible sets of
measurements, entanglement-breaking channels, and unsteerable assemblages.},

quality to meet the requirements of ontology engineers, significantly

Abstract      = {Accurately predicting complex protein-protein interactions (PPIs) is crucial
for decoding biological processes, from cellular functioning to disease
mechanisms. However, experimental methods for determining PPIs are
computationally expensive. Thus, attention has been recently drawn to machine
learning approaches. Furthermore, insufficient effort has been made toward
analyzing signed PPI networks, which capture both activating (positive) and
inhibitory (negative) interactions. To accurately represent biological
relationships, we present the Signed Two-Space Proximity Model (S2-SPM) for
signed PPI networks, which explicitly incorporates both types of interactions,
reflecting the complex regulatory mechanisms within biological systems. This is
achieved by leveraging two independent latent spaces to differentiate between
positive and negative interactions while representing protein similarity
through proximity in these spaces. Our approach also enables the identification
of archetypes representing extreme protein profiles. S2-SPM's superior
performance in predicting the presence and sign of interactions in SPPI
networks is demonstrated in link prediction tasks against relevant baseline
methods. Additionally, the biological prevalence of the identified archetypes
is confirmed by an enrichment analysis of Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which
reveals that distinct biological tasks are associated with archetypal groups
formed by both interactions. This study is also validated regarding statistical
significance and sensitivity analysis, providing insights into the functional
roles of different interaction types. Finally, the robustness and consistency
of the extracted archetype structures are confirmed using the Bayesian
Normalized Mutual Information (BNMI) metric, proving the model's reliability in
capturing meaningful SPPI patterns.},

Abstract      = {The free energy principle (FEP), along with the associated constructs of
Markov blankets and ontological potentials, have recently been presented as the
core components of a generalized modeling method capable of mathematically
describing arbitrary objects that persist in random dynamical systems; that is,
a mathematical theory of ``every'' ``thing''. Here, we leverage the FEP to
develop a mathematical physics approach to the identification of objects,
object types, and the macroscopic, object-type-specific rules that govern their
behavior. We take a generative modeling approach and use variational Bayesian
expectation maximization to develop a dynamic Markov blanket detection
algorithm that is capable of identifying and classifying macroscopic objects,
given partial observation of microscopic dynamics. This unsupervised algorithm
uses Bayesian attention to explicitly label observable microscopic elements
according to their current role in a given system, as either the internal or
boundary elements of a given macroscopic object; and it identifies macroscopic
physical laws that govern how the object interacts with its environment.
Because these labels are dynamic or evolve over time, the algorithm is capable
of identifying complex objects that travel through fixed media or exchange
matter with their environment. This approach leads directly to a flexible class
of structured, unsupervised algorithms that sensibly partition complex
many-particle or many-component systems into collections of interacting
macroscopic subsystems, namely, ``objects'' or ``things''. We derive a few
examples of this kind of macroscopic physics discovery algorithm and
demonstrate its utility with simple numerical experiments, in which the
algorithm correctly labels the components of Newton's cradle, a burning fuse,
the Lorenz attractor, and a simulated cell.},

Abstract      = {Sustainable agricultural production aligns with several sustainability goals
established by the United Nations (UN). However, there is a lack of studies
that comprehensively examine sustainable agricultural practices across various
products and production methods. Such research could provide valuable insights
into the diverse factors influencing the sustainability of specific crops and
produce while also identifying practices and conditions that are universally
applicable to all forms of agricultural production. While this research might
help us better understand sustainability, the community would still need a
consistent set of vocabularies. These consistent vocabularies, which represent
the underlying datasets, can then be stored in a global food systems datahub.
The standardized vocabularies might help encode important information for
further statistical analyses and AI/ML approaches in the datasets, resulting in
the research targeting sustainable agricultural production. A structured method
of representing information in sustainability, especially for wheat production,
is currently unavailable. In an attempt to address this gap, we are building a
set of ontologies and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) that encode knowledge associated
with sustainable wheat production using formal logic. The data for this set of
knowledge graphs are collected from public data sources, experimental results
collected at our experiments at Kansas State University, and a Sustainability
Workshop that we organized earlier in the year, which helped us collect input
from different stakeholders throughout the value chain of wheat. The modeling
of the ontology (i.e., the schema) for the Knowledge Graph has been in progress
with the help of our domain experts, following a modular structure using KNARM
methodology. In this paper, we will present our preliminary results and schemas
of our Knowledge Graph and ontologies.},

Abstract      = {In Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where the schema of the data is usually defined by
particular ontologies, reasoning is a necessity to perform a range of tasks,
such as retrieval of information, question answering, and the derivation of new
knowledge. However, information to populate KGs is often extracted (semi-)
automatically from natural language resources, or by integrating datasets that
follow different semantic schemas, resulting in KG inconsistency. This,
however, hinders the process of reasoning. In this survey, we focus on how to
perform reasoning on inconsistent KGs, by analyzing the state of the art
towards three complementary directions: a) the detection of the parts of the KG
that cause the inconsistency, b) the fixing of an inconsistent KG to render it
consistent, and c) the inconsistency-tolerant reasoning. We discuss existing
work from a range of relevant fields focusing on how, and in which cases they
are related to the above directions. We also highlight persisting challenges

Abstract      = {Biomedical ontologies, which comprehensively define concepts and relations
for biomedical entities, are crucial for structuring and formalizing
domain-specific information representations. Biomedical code mapping identifies
similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining
high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined
mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by
manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain
expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide
unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or
supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested
candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a
recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new
research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual
refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work,
we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge
graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our
solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between
ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of
results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our
solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be
reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation
results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to
enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is

Abstract      = {Text-to-image (T2I) models enable rapid concept design, making them widely
used in AI-driven design. While recent studies focus on generating semantic and
stylistic variations of given design concepts, functional coherence--the
integration of multiple affordances into a single coherent concept--remains
largely overlooked. In this paper, we introduce SYNTHIA, a framework for
generating novel, functionally coherent designs based on desired affordances.
Our approach leverages a hierarchical concept ontology that decomposes concepts
into parts and affordances, serving as a crucial building block for
functionally coherent design. We also develop a curriculum learning scheme
based on our ontology that contrastively fine-tunes T2I models to progressively
learn affordance composition while maintaining visual novelty. To elaborate, we
(i) gradually increase affordance distance, guiding models from basic
concept-affordance association to complex affordance compositions that
integrate parts of distinct affordances into a single, coherent form, and (ii)
enforce visual novelty by employing contrastive objectives to push learned
representations away from existing concepts. Experimental results show that
SYNTHIA outperforms state-of-the-art T2I models, demonstrating absolute gains
of 25.1% and 14.7% for novelty and functional coherence in human evaluation,
respectively.},

incompatibility -- or, equivalently, order-dependent theoretical predictions of
sequential measurements -- is sufficient to stop them from being able to
adequately represent a scenario. This is because, as we argue, the quantum
state update rule requires ontological models to update their states according
to conditional probability, which in turn renders predictions of sequential
measurements order-independent. This implies that ontological models, even
contextual ones, must either act differently to what we would expect given the
quantum state update rule, or cannot model quantum behaviour. Building on this,
we argue that classical wave theory is equally incompatible with ontological
models, challenging the notion that generalized contextuality serves as a
signature of classicality.},

interpretability and intervenability into an existing model by integrating
Concept Layers (CLs) into its architecture. Our approach projects the model's
internal vector representations into a conceptual, explainable vector space
before reconstructing and feeding them back into the model. Furthermore, we
eliminate the need for a human-selected concept set by algorithmically
searching an ontology for a set of concepts that can be either task-specific or
task-agnostic. We evaluate CLs across multiple tasks, demonstrating that they
maintain the original model's performance and agreement while enabling

quotiented OPTs, which sets them apart from the closely related framework of
generalized probabilistic theories (GPTs), is their explicit specification of
the structure of instruments, these being generalizations of $\textit{quantum
instruments}$ (including nondestructive measurements); in particular, one needs
to explicitly declare which collections of transformations constitute a valid
instrument. We are particularly interested in strongly causal OPTs, in which
the choice of a future instrument can be conditioned on a past measurement
outcome. This instrument structure might seem to permit the possibility of a
contextual kind of ontological representation, where the representation of a
given transformation depends on which instrument it is considered a part of.
However, we prove that this is not possible by showing that for strongly causal
quotiented OPTs the structure of instruments does $\textit{not}$ allow for such
a contextual ontological representation. It follows that ontological
representations of strongly causal quotiented OPTs are entirely determined by
their action on individual transformations, with no dependence on the structure
of instruments.},

novel framework that constructs reasoning paths from purposes back to

labels and condition labels, (2) constructing label reasoning paths based on
the KG ontology, and (3) using the label reasoning paths to guide knowledge

Abstract      = {The evolution of microscopy, beginning with its invention in the late 16th
century, has continuously enhanced our ability to explore and understand the
microscopic world, enabling increasingly detailed observations of structures

need for sophisticated methods to explore and understand the composition of
complex data collections. This paper introduces the Vendiscope, the first
algorithmic microscope designed to extend traditional microscopy to
computational analysis. The Vendiscope leverages the Vendi scores -- a family
of differentiable diversity metrics rooted in ecology and quantum mechanics --
and assigns weights to data points based on their contribution to the overall
diversity of the collection. These weights enable high-resolution data analysis
at scale. We demonstrate this across biology, materials science, and machine
learning (ML). We analyzed the $250$ million protein sequences in the protein
universe, discovering that over $200$ million are near-duplicates and that
AlphaFold fails on proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) functions that contribute
most to diversity. Applying the Vendiscope to the Materials Project database
led to similar findings: more than $85\%$ of the crystals with formation energy
data are near-duplicates and ML models perform poorly on materials that enhance
diversity. Additionally, the Vendiscope can be used to study phenomena such as
memorization in generative models. We used the Vendiscope to identify memorized
training samples from $13$ different generative models and found that the
best-performing ones often memorize the training samples that contribute least
to diversity. Our findings demonstrate that the Vendiscope can serve as a
powerful tool for data-driven science.},

Abstract      = {Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and other generative models are widely

approaches rely on Euclidean geometric assumptions and statistical
approximations that fail to capture the structured and emergent nature of data
generation. This paper introduces the Convergent Fusion Paradigm (CFP) theory,
a novel geometric framework that redefines data generation by integrating
dimensional expansion accompanied by qualitative transformation. By modifying
the latent space geometry to interact with emergent high-dimensional
structures, CFP theory addresses key challenges such as identifiability issues
and unintended artifacts like hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs).
CFP theory is based on two key conceptual hypotheses that redefine how
generative models structure relationships between data and algorithms. Through
the lens of CFP theory, we critically examine existing metric-learning
approaches. CFP theory advances this perspective by introducing time-reversed
metric embeddings and structural convergence mechanisms, leading to a novel
geometric approach that better accounts for data generation as a structured
epistemic process. Beyond its computational implications, CFP theory provides
philosophical insights into the ontological underpinnings of data generation.
By offering a systematic framework for high-dimensional learning dynamics, CFP
theory contributes to establishing a theoretical foundation for understanding
the data-relationship structures in AI. Finally, future research in CFP theory
will be led to its implications for fully realizing qualitative
transformations, introducing the potential of Hilbert space in generative

Abstract      = {This paper presents a complete explainable system that interprets a set of
data, abstracts the underlying features and describes them in a natural
language of choice. The system relies on two crucial stages: (i) identifying
emerging properties from data and transforming them into abstract concepts, and
(ii) converting these concepts into natural language. Despite the impressive
natural language generation capabilities demonstrated by Large Language Models,
their statistical nature and the intricacy of their internal mechanism still
force us to employ these techniques as black boxes, forgoing trustworthiness.
Developing an explainable pipeline for data interpretation would allow
facilitating its use in safety-critical environments like processing medical
information and allowing non-experts and visually impaired people to access
narrated information. To this end, we believe that the fields of knowledge
representation and automated reasoning research could present a valid
alternative. Expanding on prior research that tackled the first stage (i), we
focus on the second stage, named Concept2Text. Being explainable, data
translation is easily modeled through logic-based rules, once again emphasizing
the role of declarative programming in achieving AI explainability. This paper
explores a Prolog/CLP-based rewriting system to interpret concepts-articulated
in terms of classes and relations, plus common knowledge-derived from a generic
ontology, generating natural language text. Its main features include
hierarchical tree rewritings, modular multilingual generation, support for
equivalent variants across semantic, grammar, and lexical levels, and a
transparent rule-based system. We outline the architecture and demonstrate its
flexibility through some examples capable of generating numerous diverse and
equivalent rewritings based on the input concept.},

Abstract      = {Metamodeling refers to scenarios in ontologies in which classes and roles can
be members of classes or occur in roles. This is a desirable modelling feature
in several applications, but allowing it without restrictions is problematic
for several reasons, mainly because it causes undecidability. Therefore,
practical languages either forbid metamodeling explicitly or treat occurrences
of classes as instances to be semantically different from other occurrences,
thereby not allowing metamodeling semantically. Several extensions have been
proposed to provide metamodeling to some extent. Building on earlier work that
reduces metamodeling query answering to Datalog query answering, recently
reductions to query answering over hybrid knowledge bases were proposed with
the aim of using the Datalog transformation only where necessary. Preliminary
work showed that the approach works, but the hoped-for performance improvements
were not observed yet. In this work we expand on this body of work by improving
the theoretical basis of the reductions and by using alternative tools that
show competitive performance.},

cognition-enabled robotic agents with environmental interaction capabilities
close to human proficiency. This approach is based on human-derived neuronal
data in combination with a shared ontology to enable robots to learn from human
experiences. To gain further insight into the relation between human neuronal
activity patterns and ontological classes, we introduced General Linear Model
(GLM) analyses on fMRI data of participants who were presented with complex
naturalistic video stimuli comparable to the robot tasks. We modeled four event
classes (pick, place, fetch and deliver) attached to different environmental
and object-related context and employed a Representational Similarity Analysis
(RSA) on associated brain activity patterns as a starting point for an
automatic hierarchical clustering. Based on the default values for the
Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), the activity patterns were reliably
grouped according to their parent classes of object interaction and navigation.
Although fetch and deliver events were also distinguished by neuronal patterns,
pick and place events demonstrated higher ambiguity with respect to neuronal
activation patterns. Introducing a shorter HRF time-to-peak leads to a more
reliable grouping of all four semantic classes, despite contextual factors.
These data might give novel insights into the neuronal representation of
complex stimuli and may enable further research in ontology validation in
cognition-enabled robotics.},

Abstract      = {The conventional resource search in cloud infrastructure relies on
keyword-based searches or GUIDs, which demand exact matches and significant
user effort to locate resources. These conventional search approaches often
fail to interpret the intent behind natural language queries, making resource
discovery inefficient and inaccessible to users. Though there exists some form
of NLP based search engines, they are limited and focused more on analyzing the
NLP query itself and extracting identifiers to find the resources. But they
fail to search resources based on their behavior or operations or their
capabilities or relationships or features or business relevance or the dynamic
changing state or the knowledge these resources have. The search criteria has
been changing with the inundation of AI based services which involved
discovering not just the requested resources and identifiers but seeking
insights. The real intent of a search has never been to just to list the
resources but with some actual context such as to understand causes of some
behavior in the system, compliance checks, capacity estimations, network
constraints, or troubleshooting or business insights. This paper proposes an
advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) enhanced by ontology-based semantics
to enable intuitive, human-readable queries which allows users to actually
discover the intent-of-search itself. By constructing an ontology of cloud
resources, their interactions, and behaviors, the proposed framework enables
dynamic intent extraction and relevance ranking using Latent Semantic Indexing
(LSI) and AI models. It introduces an automated pipeline which integrates
ontology extraction by AI powered data crawlers, building a semantic knowledge
base for context aware resource discovery.},

Abstract      = {Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reporting is critical for governments,
businesses, and investors. However, adoption remains limited particularly among
small and medium enterprises due to high implementation costs, fragmented
emission factor databases, and a lack of robust sector classification methods.
To address these challenges, we introduce Group Reasoning Emission Estimation
Networks (GREEN), an AI-driven carbon accounting framework that standardizes
enterprise-level emission estimation, constructs a large-scale benchmark
dataset, and leverages a novel reasoning approach with large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, we compile textual descriptions for 20,850 companies with
validated North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) labels and
align these with an economic model of carbon intensity factors. By reframing
sector classification as an information retrieval task, we fine-tune
Sentence-BERT models using a contrastive learning loss. To overcome the
limitations of single-stage models in handling thousands of hierarchical
categories, we propose a Group Reasoning method that ensembles LLM classifiers
based on the natural NAICS ontology, decomposing the task into multiple
sub-classification steps. We theoretically prove that this approach reduces
classification uncertainty and computational complexity. Experiments on 1,114
NAICS categories yield state-of-the-art performance (83.68% Top-1, 91.47%
Top-10 accuracy), and case studies on 20 companies report a mean absolute

Abstract      = {Existing domain-specific Large Language Models (LLMs) are typically developed
by fine-tuning general-purposed LLMs with large-scale domain-specific corpora.
However, training on large-scale corpora often fails to effectively organize
domain knowledge of LLMs, leading to fragmented understanding. Inspired by how
humans connect concepts and organize knowledge through mind maps, we aim to
emulate this approach by using ontology with hierarchical conceptual knowledge
to reorganize LLM's domain knowledge. From this perspective, we propose an
ontology-driven self-training framework called OntoTune, which aims to align
LLMs with ontology through in-context learning, enabling the generation of
responses guided by the ontology. We leverage in-context learning to identify
whether the LLM has acquired the specific concept's ontology knowledge, and
select the entries not yet mastered by LLM as the training set to further align
the LLM with ontology. Compared to existing domain LLMs based on newly
collected large-scale domain-specific corpora, our OntoTune, which relies on
the existing, long-term developed ontology and LLM itself, significantly
reduces data maintenance costs and offers improved generalization ability. We
conduct our study in the medical domain to evaluate the effectiveness of
OntoTune, utilizing a standardized medical ontology, SNOMED CT as our ontology
source. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoTune achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both in-ontology task hypernym discovery and
out-of-ontology task medical domain QA. Moreover, compared to the latest direct
ontology injection method TaxoLLaMA, our OntoTune better preserves original
knowledge of LLM. The code and data are available at

representation and reasoning offer a way to explicitly translate abstract
ethical concepts into applicable principles within the context of an event. To
achieve this, we propose ApplE, an Applied Ethics ontology that captures
philosophical theory and event context to holistically describe the morality of
an action. The development process adheres to a modified version of the
Simplified Agile Methodology for Ontology Development (SAMOD) and utilizes
standard design and publication practices. Using ApplE, we model a use case
from the bioethics domain that demonstrates our ontology's social and
scientific value. Apart from the ontological reasoning and quality checks,
ApplE is also evaluated using the three-fold testing process of SAMOD. ApplE
follows FAIR principles and aims to be a viable resource for applied ethicists

Abstract      = {Most existing Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) approaches are
designed for a specific KG, such as Wikidata, DBpedia or Freebase. Due to the
heterogeneity of the underlying graph schema, topology and assertions, most
KGQA systems cannot be transferred to unseen Knowledge Graphs (KGs) without
resource-intensive training data. We present OntoSCPrompt, a novel Large
Language Model (LLM)-based KGQA approach with a two-stage architecture that
separates semantic parsing from KG-dependent interactions. OntoSCPrompt first
generates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT,
ASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with
KG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we
present an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG
ontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and
continuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies
to ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both
stages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as
SOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ,
WebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well
to unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG Code:

Abstract      = {Foundation models trained on patient electronic health records (EHRs) require
tokenizing medical data into sequences of discrete vocabulary items. Existing
tokenizers treat medical codes from EHRs as isolated textual tokens. However,
each medical code is defined by its textual description, its position in
ontological hierarchies, and its relationships to other codes, such as disease
co-occurrences and drug-treatment associations. Medical vocabularies contain
more than 600,000 codes with critical information for clinical reasoning. We
introduce MedTok, a multimodal medical code tokenizer that uses the text
descriptions and relational context of codes. MedTok processes text using a
language model encoder and encodes the relational structure with a graph
encoder. It then quantizes both modalities into a unified token space,
preserving modality-specific and cross-modality information. We integrate
MedTok into five EHR models and evaluate it on operational and clinical tasks
across in-patient and out-patient datasets, including outcome prediction,
diagnosis classification, drug recommendation, and risk stratification.
Swapping standard EHR tokenizers with MedTok improves AUPRC across all EHR
models, by 4.10% on MIMIC-III, 4.78% on MIMIC-IV, and 11.32% on EHRShot, with
the largest gains in drug recommendation. Beyond EHR modeling, we demonstrate
using MedTok tokenizer with medical QA systems. Our results demonstrate the
potential of MedTok as a unified tokenizer for medical codes, improving
tokenization for medical foundation models.},

Abstract      = {Language Model Agents (LMAs) are increasingly treated as capable of

industrial, social and governmental settings. But LMAs are not normal agents.
They inherit the structural problems of the large language models (LLMs) around
which they are built: hallucinations, jailbreaking, misalignment and
unpredictability. In this Position paper we argue LMAs should not be treated as
normal agents, because doing so leads to problems that undermine their utility
and trustworthiness. We enumerate pathologies of agency intrinsic to LMAs.
Despite scaffolding such as external memory and tools, they remain
ontologically stateless, stochastic, semantically sensitive, and linguistically
intermediated. These pathologies destabilise the ontological properties of LMAs
including identifiability, continuity, persistence and and consistency,
problematising their claim to agency. In response, we argue LMA ontological
properties should be measured before, during and after deployment so that the
negative effects of pathologies can be mitigated.},

Abstract      = {Rare diseases are challenging to diagnose due to limited patient data and
genetic diversity. Despite advances in variant prioritization, many cases
remain undiagnosed. While large language models (LLMs) have performed well in
medical exams, their effectiveness in diagnosing rare genetic diseases has not
been assessed. To identify causal genes, we benchmarked various LLMs for gene
prioritization. Using multi-agent and Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO)
classification, we categorized patients based on phenotypes and solvability
levels. As gene set size increased, LLM performance deteriorated, so we used a
divide-and-conquer strategy to break the task into smaller subsets. At
baseline, GPT-4 outperformed other LLMs, achieving near 30% accuracy in ranking
causal genes correctly. The multi-agent and HPO approaches helped distinguish
confidently solved cases from challenging ones, highlighting the importance of
known gene-phenotype associations and phenotype specificity. We found that
cases with specific phenotypes or clear associations were more accurately
solved. However, we observed biases toward well-studied genes and input order
sensitivity, which hindered gene prioritization. Our divide-and-conquer
strategy improved accuracy by overcoming these biases. By utilizing HPO
classification, novel multi-agent techniques, and our LLM strategy, we improved
causal gene identification accuracy compared to our baseline evaluation. This
approach streamlines rare disease diagnosis, facilitates reanalysis of unsolved
cases, and accelerates gene discovery, supporting the development of targeted
diagnostics and therapies.},

strategic moments to ask questions, reveal assumptions, or pause. We present an
ontology of positive friction and collect expert human annotations on
multi-domain and embodied goal-oriented corpora. Experiments on these corpora,
along with simulated interactions using state-of-the-art systems, suggest
incorporating friction not only fosters accountable decision-making, but also
enhances machine understanding of user beliefs and goals, and increases task

sustainable development goals of the 2030 agenda. Document annotation, which
was traditionally carried out with pencil and paper and currently benefits from
digital document annotation tools, is a representative example of this
transformation. Using document annotation tools, students can enrich the
documents with annotations that highlight the most relevant aspects of these
documents. As the conceptual complexity of the learning domain increases, the
annotation of the documents may require comprehensive domain knowledge and an
expert analysis capability that students usually lack. Consequently, a
proliferation of irrelevant, incorrect, and/or poorly decontextualized
annotations may appear, while other relevant aspects are completely ignored by
the students. The main hypothesis proposed by this paper is that the use of a
guiding annotation ontology in the annotation activities is a keystone aspect
to alleviate these shortcomings. Consequently, comprehension is improved,
exhaustive content analysis is promoted, and meta-reflective thinking is
developed. To test this hypothesis, we describe our own annotation tool,
\@note, which fully implements this ontology-enhanced annotation paradigm, and
we provide experimental evidence about how \@note can improve academic
performance via a pilot study concerning critical literary annotation.},

embeddings learned and patterns with and without ground truth. Additionally it
incorporates an attention mechanism that leverages both node and edge features.
The architecture, trained end-to-end, comprises two primary components:
embedding generation and prediction. First, a graph neural network (GNN)
transform raw node features into dense, low-dimensional embeddings,
incorporating edge attributes. Then, a feedforward neural model processes the
node embeddings to produce the final output. Experiments demonstrate that our
model matches or exceeds existing methods for protein-protein interactions
prediction and Gene Ontology (GO) terms prediction. The model also performs
effectively with one-hot encoding for node features, providing a solution for
the previously unsolved problem of predicting similarity between compounds with
unknown structures.},

Abstract      = {Ontology matching (OM) plays a key role in enabling data interoperability and
knowledge sharing, but it remains challenging due to the need for large
training datasets and limited vocabulary processing in machine learning
approaches. Recently, methods based on Large Language Model (LLMs) have shown
great promise in OM, particularly through the use of a retrieve-then-prompt
pipeline. In this approach, relevant target entities are first retrieved and
then used to prompt the LLM to predict the final matches. Despite their
potential, these systems still present limited performance and high
computational overhead. To address these issues, we introduce MILA, a novel
approach that embeds a retrieve-identify-prompt pipeline within a prioritized
depth-first search (PDFS) strategy. This approach efficiently identifies a
large number of semantic correspondences with high accuracy, limiting LLM
requests to only the most borderline cases. We evaluated MILA using the
biomedical challenge proposed in the 2023 and 2024 editions of the Ontology
Alignment Evaluation Initiative. Our method achieved the highest F-Measure in
four of the five unsupervised tasks, outperforming state-of-the-art OM systems
by up to 17%. It also performed better than or comparable to the leading
supervised OM systems. MILA further exhibited task-agnostic performance,
remaining stable across all tasks and settings, while significantly reducing
LLM requests. These findings highlight that high-performance LLM-based OM can
be achieved through a combination of programmed (PDFS), learned (embedding
vectors), and prompting-based heuristics, without the need of domain-specific
heuristics or fine-tuning.},

uphold their integrity. The systematic and conceptual understanding of
organizations has garnered significant attention from researchers due to its

within organizations. Achieving a consensus on the concepts related to the
fundamental elements that constitute an organization is therefore critical.
This study aims to conduct a comprehensive analysis and comparison of existing
conceptual models of enterprises as documented in scholarly articles published
over the past decade. We discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each model and
introduce a robust framework for their evaluation. To facilitate this
evaluation, we propose several pertinent criteria derived from established
methodologies for assessing ontologies. Furthermore, we identify contemporary
challenges and issues that have been overlooked in prior studies, offering
insights and suggestions for future research directions in enterprise modeling.

quality and eliminating superfluous measurements while appraising and
alleviating the broader societal and environmental repercussions. A traceable

  The model aims to increase traceability's utility in understanding the impact
of changes on communities affected by food production and consumption, aligning

communities and consumers. This holistic approach is further supported by an
ontological model that forms the logical foundation and a unified terminology.
By proposing a holistic and integrated solution across multiple stakeholders,
the model emphasizes quality and the extensive impact of championing
accountability, sustainability, and responsible practices with global

Abstract      = {1) Introduction and Conceptual Framework: This document explores the concept
of information design by dividing it into two major practices: defining the
meaning of a corpus of textual data and its visual or multimodal
representation. It draws on expertise in enriching textual corpora,
particularly audiovisual ones, and transforming them into multiple narrative
formats. The text highlights a crucial distinction between the semantic content
of a domain and the modalities of its graphic expression, illustrating this
approach with concepts rooted in structural semiotics and linguistics
traditions.
  2) Modeling and Conceptual Design: The article emphasizes the importance of
semantic modeling, often achieved through conceptual networks or graphs. These
tools enable the structuring of knowledge within a domain by accounting for
relationships between concepts, contexts of use, and specific objectives.
Stockinger also highlights the constraints and challenges involved in creating
dynamic and adaptable models, integrating elements such as thesauri or
interoperable ontologies to facilitate the analysis and publication of complex
corpora.
  3) Applications and Multimodal Visualization: The text concludes by examining
the practical application of these models in work environments like OKAPI,
developed to analyze, publish, and reuse audiovisual data. It also discusses
innovative approaches such as visual storytelling and document reengineering,
which involve transforming existing content into new resources tailored to
various contexts. These methods emphasize interoperability, flexibility, and
the intelligence of communication systems, paving the way for richer and more
collaborative use of digital data. The content of this document was presented

Abstract      = {When developing devices, architectures and services for the Internet of

security requirements expressed by both laws and specifications. To provide
tools guiding through these requirements and to assure a third party of the
correct compliance, an ontology charting the relevant laws and specifications
(for the European context) is very useful. We here address the development of
this ontology. Due to the very high number and size of the considered
specification documents, we have put in place a methodology and tools to
simplify the transition from natural text to an ontology. The first step is a
manual highlighting of relevant concepts in the corpus, then a manual
translation to XML/XSD is operated. We have developed a tool allowing us to
convert this semi-structured data into an ontology. Because the different
specifications use similar but different wording, our approach favors the
creation of similar instances in the ontology. To improve the ontology
simplification through instance merging, we consider the use of LLMs. The
responses of the LLMs are compared against our manually defined correct
responses. The quality of the responses of the automated system does not prove
to be good enough to be trusted blindly, and should only be used as a starting
point for a manual correction.},

Abstract      = {Causal models in statistics are often described using acyclic directed mixed
graphs (ADMGs), which contain directed and bidirected edges and no directed
cycles. This article surveys various interpretations of ADMGs, discusses their
relations in different sub-classes of ADMGs, and argues that one of them -- the
noise expansion (NE) model -- should be used as the default interpretation. Our
endorsement of the NE model is based on two observations. First, in a subclass
of ADMGs called unconfounded graphs (which retain most of the good properties
of directed acyclic graphs and bidirected graphs), the NE model is equivalent
to many other interpretations including the global Markov and nested Markov
models. Second, the NE model for an arbitrary ADMG is exactly the union of that
for all unconfounded expansions of that graph. This property is referred to as
completeness, as it shows that the model does not commit to any specific latent
variable explanation. In proving that the NE model is nested Markov, we also
develop an ADMG-based theory for causality. Finally, we compare the NE model
with the closely related but different interpretation of ADMGs as directed
acyclic graphs (DAGs) with latent variables that is commonly used in the
literature. We argue that the "latent DAG" interpretation is mathematically
unnecessary, makes obscure ontological assumptions, and discourages
practitioners from deliberating over important structural assumptions.},

Abstract      = {This is a work of hard physical philosophy, where Quantum Perspectivism is
shown to function as both an interpretation of quantum mechanics and a physical
model for understanding Nietzsche's perspectivism. This framework combines
quantum logic, the principle of complementarity, and contextuality to examine
how perspectives construct reality. In this model, measurements correspond to
Perspectives and Meta-Perspectives, represented as Boolean subalgebras and
Hilbert sub-lattices within the Hilbert lattice, respectively. The Hilbert
lattice itself is reinterpreted as Jung's Unus Mundus, a unified ontological
reality. A metaphysical observation, made by a metaphysical observer, of a
given system (World) is identified with the set of all corresponding
meta-perspectives in the Hilbert lattice/Unus Mundus, the ocean of reality.
  Perspectives, likened to islands in this ocean, correspond to single
measurements of a system, capturing the logical structure of observed
properties. Meta-perspectives, analogous to continents, represent the synthesis
of multiple measurements, providing a broader yet inherently incomplete
understanding of the system. This structure emphasizes the complementarity and
contextual dependencies of measurements while exposing the limitations of
classical objectivity in the quantum domain. Advocating for a perspectival view
of both the world and truth, Quantum Perspectivism unites quantum mechanics and
Nietzschean philosophy into a cohesive framework for exploring the interplay
between consciousness, observation, and reality.},

the autonomy of aging adults or people with a physical impairment, or they may
reduce the stress in a professional kitchen. We propose a novel approach to
computational recipe understanding that mimics the human sense-making process,
which is narrative-based. Using an English recipe for almond crescent cookies
as illustration, we show how recipes can be modelled as rich narrative
structures by integrating various knowledge sources such as language
processing, ontologies, and mental simulation. We show how such narrative
structures can be used for (a) dealing with the challenges of recipe language,
such as zero anaphora, (b) optimizing a robot's planning process, (c) measuring
how well an AI system understands its current tasks, and (d) allowing recipe

Abstract      = {Clinician notes are a rich source of patient information but often contain
inconsistencies due to varied writing styles, colloquialisms, abbreviations,
medical jargon, grammatical errors, and non-standard formatting. These
inconsistencies hinder the extraction of meaningful data from electronic health
records (EHRs), posing challenges for quality improvement, population health,
precision medicine, decision support, and research.
  We present a large language model approach to standardizing a corpus of 1,618
clinical notes. Standardization corrected an average of $4.9 +/- 1.8$
grammatical errors, $3.3 +/- 5.2$ spelling errors, converted $3.1 +/- 3.0$
non-standard terms to standard terminology, and expanded $15.8 +/- 9.1$
abbreviations and acronyms per note. Additionally, notes were re-organized into
canonical sections with standardized headings. This process prepared notes for
key concept extraction, mapping to medical ontologies, and conversion to
interoperable data formats such as FHIR.
  Expert review of randomly sampled notes found no significant data loss after
standardization. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that standardization
of clinical notes can improve their readability, consistency, and usability,
while also facilitating their conversion into interoperable data formats.},

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.SE},
Abstract      = {This paper is a sequel to an evolving research project on a diagrammatic
methodology called thinging machine (TM). Initially, it was proposed as a base
for conceptual modelling (e.g., conceptual UML) in areas such as requirement
engineering. Conceptual modelling involves a high-level representation of a
real-world system that integrates various components to refine it into a more
concrete (computer) executable form. The TM project has progressed into a more
comprehensive approach by applying it in several research areas and expanding
its theoretical and ontological foundation. Accordingly, the first part of the
paper involves enhancing some TM aspects related to structuring events in
existence, such as absent events. The second part of the paper focuses on how
to classify events and the kinds of relationships that can be recognized among
events. The notion of events has occupied a central role in modelling. It
influences computer science and such diverse disciplines as linguistics,
probability theory, artificial intelligence, physics, philosophy and history.
In TM, an event is defined as the so-called thimac (thing/machine) with a time
breath that infuses dynamism into the static description of the thimac called a
region. A region is a diagrammatic specification based on five generic actions:
create, process, release, transfer and receive. The results of this research
provide (a) an enrichment of conceptual modelling, especially concerning
varieties of existence, e.g., absent events of negative propositions, and (b) a
proposal that instead of semantic categorizations of events, it is possible to
develop a new type of classification based on graphs grounded on the TM model
diagrams.},

quantification technique called conformal risk control (CRC). We demonstrate
that prediction sets with conformal guarantees are attractive measures of
predictive uncertainty in the safety-critical healthcare domain, allowing
end-users to achieve arbitrary validity by trading off false positives and
providing formal statistical guarantees on model performance. Among
ground-truth nodules annotated by at least three radiologists, our model
achieves a sensitivity that is competitive with that generally achieved by
individual radiologists, with a slight increase in false positives.
Furthermore, we illustrate the risks of using off-the-shelve prediction models
when faced with ontological uncertainty, such as when radiologists disagree on
what constitutes the ground truth on pulmonary nodules.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Survival analysis (SA) models have been widely studied in mining electronic
health records (EHRs), particularly in forecasting the risk of critical
conditions for prioritizing high-risk patients. However, their vulnerability to
adversarial attacks is much less explored in the literature. Developing
black-box perturbation algorithms and evaluating their impact on
state-of-the-art survival models brings two benefits to medical applications.
First, it can effectively evaluate the robustness of models in pre-deployment
testing. Also, exploring how subtle perturbations would result in significantly
different outcomes can provide counterfactual insights into the clinical
interpretation of model prediction. In this work, we introduce SurvAttack, a
novel black-box adversarial attack framework leveraging subtle clinically
compatible, and semantically consistent perturbations on longitudinal EHRs to
degrade survival models' predictive performance. We specifically develop a
greedy algorithm to manipulate medical codes with various adversarial actions
throughout a patient's medical history. Then, these adversarial actions are
prioritized using a composite scoring strategy based on multi-aspect
perturbation quality, including saliency, perturbation stealthiness, and
clinical meaningfulness. The proposed adversarial EHR perturbation algorithm is
then used in an efficient SA-specific strategy to attack a survival model when
estimating the temporal ranking of survival urgency for patients. To
demonstrate the significance of our work, we conduct extensive experiments,
including baseline comparisons, explainability analysis, and case studies. The
experimental results affirm our research's effectiveness in illustrating the
vulnerabilities of patient survival models, model interpretation, and
ultimately contributing to healthcare quality.},

works by Cialdini (2007), Gragg (2003), and Stajano and Wilson (2011) to
propose a unique list of persuasion principles in social engineering. While
Ferreira and Teles focused on email subject lines, this research analyzed
entire email contents to identify principles of human persuasion in phishing
emails. This study also examined the goals and targets of phishing emails,
providing a novel contribution to the field. Applying these findings to the
ontological model by Mouton et al. (2014) reveals that when social engineers
use email for phishing, individuals are the primary targets. The goals are
typically unauthorized access, followed by financial gain and service
disruption, with Distraction as the most commonly used compliance principle.
This research highlights the importance of understanding human persuasion in
technology-mediated interactions to develop methods for detecting and
preventing phishing emails before they reach users. Despite previous
identification of luring elements in phishing emails, empirical findings have
been inconsistent. For example, Akbar (2014) found 'authority' and 'scarcity'
most common, while Ferreira et al. (2015) identified 'liking' and 'similarity.'
In this study, 'Distraction' was most frequently used, followed by 'Deception,'
'Integrity,' and 'Authority.' This paper offers additional insights into
phishing email tactics and suggests future solutions should leverage
socio-technical principles. Future work will apply this methodology to other
social engineering techniques beyond phishing emails, using the ontological
model to further inform the research community.},

closer network distances among diseases can predict greater similarities in
their clinical manifestations, treatment approaches, and psychological
mechanisms, and closer distances between symptoms indicate that they are more
likely to co-occur. Lastly, by comparing the proximity d and proximity z score,
it was shown that symptom-disease pairs in primary diagnostic relationships
have a stronger association and are of higher referential value than those in
diagnostic relationships. The research results revealed the potential

timestamp-based probability for abnormal event detection and time
interval-based probability for conjunction of multiple events. We conducted
experiments (over a 78-day period) in a real smart building environment. The
data of light and elevator states has been collected for evaluation. The
evaluation revealed several inferred events, such as room occupancy, elevator
trajectory tracking, and the conjunction of both events. The numerical values

Abstract      = {Large language models (LLMs) excel at clinical information extraction but

distillation--the process of transferring knowledge from larger to smaller

BERT models, which are approximately 1,000 times smaller than modern LLMs, for
clinical named entity recognition (NER) tasks. We leveraged state-of-the-art
LLMs (Gemini and OpenAI models) and medical ontologies (RxNorm and SNOMED) as
teacher labelers for medication, disease, and symptom extraction. We applied
our approach to over 3,300 clinical notes spanning five publicly available
datasets, comparing distilled BERT models against both their teacher labelers
and BERT models fine-tuned on human labels. External validation was conducted
using clinical notes from the MedAlign dataset. For disease extraction, F1
scores were 0.82 (teacher model), 0.89 (BioBERT trained on human labels), and
0.84 (BioBERT-distilled). For medication, F1 scores were 0.84 (teacher model),
0.91 (BioBERT-human), and 0.87 (BioBERT-distilled). For symptoms: F1 score of
0.73 (teacher model) and 0.68 (BioBERT-distilled). Distilled BERT models had
faster inference (12x, 4x, 8x faster than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and Gemini Flash
respectively) and lower costs (85x, 101x, 2x cheaper than GPT-4o, o1-mini, and
Gemini Flash respectively). On the external validation dataset, the distilled
BERT model achieved F1 scores of 0.883 (medication), 0.726 (disease), and 0.699
(symptom). Distilled BERT models were up to 101x cheaper and 12x faster than
state-of-the-art LLMs while achieving similar performance on NER tasks.

innovative method for managing class imbalance, the elimination of confidence
threshold selection, and a modular structure. Two experiments were conducted to
compare the performance of conventional classification models with the
Multiplex approach. Our results demonstrate that the Multiplex approach can
improve classification performance significantly (up to 10% gain in overall F1

and pronounced class imbalances. However, it also has limitations, as it
requires a thorough understanding of the problem domain and some experience

stranded in the desert after a flat tyre, and a functional firewall mitigates
the risk of a hacker intruding the network. The Common Ontology of Value and
Risk (COVER) highlights how the role of objects and their relationships remains
pivotal to performing transparent, complete and accountable risk assessment. In
this paper, we operationalize some of the notions proposed by COVER -- such as
parthood between objects and participation of objects in events/actions -- by
presenting a new framework for risk assessment: WATCHDOG. WATCHDOG enriches the
expressivity of vetted formal models for risk -- i.e., fault trees and attack
trees -- by bridging the disciplines of ontology and formal methods into an
ontology-aware formal framework composed by a more expressive modelling
formalism, Object-Oriented Disruption Graphs (DOGs), logic (DOGLog) and an
intermediate query language (DOGLang). With these, WATCHDOG allows risk
assessors to pose questions about disruption propagation, disruption likelihood
and risk levels, keeping the fundamental role of objects at risk always in
sight.},

Abstract      = {Rhetorical figures play an important role in our communication. They are used
to convey subtle, implicit meaning, or to emphasize statements. We notice them
in hate speech, fake news, and propaganda. By improving the systems for
computational detection of rhetorical figures, we can also improve tasks such
as hate speech and fake news detection, sentiment analysis, opinion mining, or
argument mining. Unfortunately, there is a lack of annotated data, as well as
qualified annotators that would help us build large corpora to train machine
learning models for the detection of rhetorical figures. The situation is
particularly difficult in languages other than English, and for rhetorical
figures other than metaphor, sarcasm, and irony. To overcome this issue, we
develop a web application called "Find your Figure" that facilitates the
identification and annotation of German rhetorical figures. The application is
based on the German Rhetorical ontology GRhOOT which we have specially adapted
for this purpose. In addition, we improve the user experience with Retrieval
Augmented Generation (RAG). In this paper, we present the restructuring of the
ontology, the development of the web application, and the built-in RAG
pipeline. We also identify the optimal RAG settings for our application. Our
approach is one of the first to practically use rhetorical ontologies in
combination with RAG and shows promising results.},

Abstract      = {Competency Questions (CQs) are widely used in ontology development by
guiding, among others, the scoping and validation stages. However, very limited
guidance exists for formulating CQs and assessing whether they are good CQs,
leading to issues such as ambiguity and unusable formulations. To solve this,
one requires insight into the nature of CQs for ontologies and their
constituent parts, as well as which ones are not. We aim to contribute to such
theoretical foundations in this paper, which is informed by analysing
questions, their uses, and the myriad of ontology development tasks. This
resulted in a first Model for Competency Questions, which comprises five main
types of CQs, each with a different purpose: Scoping (SCQ), Validating (VCQ),
Foundational (FCQ), Relationship (RCQ), and Metaproperty (MpCQ) questions. This
model enhances the clarity of CQs and therewith aims to improve on the
effectiveness of CQs in ontology development, thanks to their respective
identifiable distinct constituent elements. We illustrate and evaluate them
with a user story and demonstrate where which type can be used in ontology
development tasks. To foster use and research, we created an annotated
repository of 438 CQs, the Repository of Ontology Competency QuestionS (ROCQS),
incorporating an existing CQ dataset and new CQs and CQ templates, which
further demonstrate distinctions among types of CQs.},

guarantee termination when infinitely many time intervals are possibly

such a set in general, we identify a class of counting queries whose spectra
can be effectively represented. Focusing on atomic counting queries, we
pinpoint the possible shapes of a spectrum over $\mathcal{ALCIF}$ ontologies:
they are essentially the subsets of $\mathbb{N} \cup \{ \infty \}$ closed under
addition. For most sublogics of $\mathcal{ALCIF}$, we show that possible
spectra enjoy simpler shapes, being $[ m, \infty ]$ or variations thereof. To
obtain our results, we refine constructions used for finite model reasoning and
notably rely on a cycle-reversion technique for the Horn fragment of
$\mathcal{ALCIF}$. We also study the data complexity of computing the proposed
effective representation and establish the
$\mathsf{FP}^{\mathsf{NP}[\log]}$-completeness of this task under several

drafted a set of model licenses that provide flexible options to meet the

Abstract      = {In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), generative linguistic
steganography has become a prevalent technique for hiding information within

effectively align steganographic texts with original model-generated texts due
to the lower entropy of the predicted probability distribution of LLMs. This
results in a decrease in embedding capacity and poses challenges for decoding
stegos in real-world communication channels. To address these challenges, we
propose a semantic steganography framework based on LLMs, which construct a
semantic space and map secret messages onto this space using ontology-entity
trees. This framework offers robustness and reliability for transmission in
complex channels, as well as resistance to text rendering and word blocking.
Additionally, the stegos generated by our framework are indistinguishable from
the covers and achieve a higher embedding capacity compared to state-of-the-art
steganography methods, while producing higher quality stegos.},

Abstract      = {Since decades, the modelling of metadata has been core to the functioning of
any academic library. Its importance has only enhanced with the increasing
pervasiveness of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven information
activities and services which constitute a library's outreach. However, with
the rising importance of metadata, there arose several outstanding problems
with the process of designing a library metadata model impacting its
reusability, crosswalk and interoperability with other metadata models. This
paper posits that the above problems stem from an underlying thesis that there
should only be a few core metadata models which would be necessary and
sufficient for any information service using them, irrespective of the
heterogeneity of intra-domain or inter-domain settings. To that end, this paper
advances a contrary view of the above thesis and substantiates its argument in
three key steps. First, it introduces a novel way of thinking about a library
metadata model as an ontology-driven composition of five functionally
interlinked representation levels from perception to its intensional definition
via properties. Second, it introduces the representational manifoldness
implicit in each of the five levels which cumulatively contributes to a
conceptually entangled library metadata model. Finally, and most importantly,
it proposes a Generative AI-driven Human-Large Language Model (LLM)
collaboration based metadata modelling approach to disentangle the entanglement
inherent in each representation level leading to the generation of a
conceptually disentangled metadata model. Throughout the paper, the arguments
are exemplified by motivating scenarios and examples from representative
libraries handling cancer information.},

of toy truck. The agent starts the learning process with no ontology about what
types of trucks exist nor which parts they have, and a deficient model for
recognizing those parts from visual input. The teacher's feedback to the
agent's explanations addresses its lack of relevant knowledge in the ontology
via a generic rule (e.g., "dump trucks have dumpers"), whereas an inaccurate
part recognition is corrected by a deictic statement (e.g., "this is not a
dumper"). The learner utilizes this feedback not only to improve its estimate
of the hypothesis space of possible domain ontologies and probability
distributions over them, but also to use those estimates to update its visual
interpretation of the scene. Our experiments demonstrate that teacher-learner
pairs utilizing explanations and corrections are more data-efficient than those
without such a faculty.},

Abstract      = {This paper presents OG-RAG, an Ontology-Grounded Retrieval Augmented
Generation method designed to enhance LLM-generated responses by anchoring
retrieval processes in domain-specific ontologies. While LLMs are widely used
for tasks like question answering and search, they struggle to adapt to
specialized knowledge, such as industrial workflows or knowledge work, without
expensive fine-tuning or sub-optimal retrieval methods. Existing
retrieval-augmented models, such as RAG, offer improvements but fail to account
for structured domain knowledge, leading to suboptimal context generation.
Ontologies, which conceptually organize domain knowledge by defining entities
and their interrelationships, offer a structured representation to address this
gap. OG-RAG constructs a hypergraph representation of domain documents, where
each hyperedge encapsulates clusters of factual knowledge grounded using
domain-specific ontology. An optimization algorithm then retrieves the minimal
set of hyperedges that constructs a precise, conceptually grounded context for
the LLM. This method enables efficient retrieval while preserving the complex
relationships between entities. OG-RAG applies to domains where fact-based
reasoning is essential, particularly in tasks that require workflows or
decision-making steps to follow predefined rules and procedures. These include
industrial workflows in healthcare, legal, and agricultural sectors, as well as
knowledge-driven tasks such as news journalism, investigative research,
consulting and more. Our evaluations demonstrate that OG-RAG increases the
recall of accurate facts by 55% and improves response correctness by 40% across
four different LLMs. Additionally, OG-RAG enables 30% faster attribution of
responses to context and boosts fact-based reasoning accuracy by 27% compared
to baseline methods.},

Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are crucial for representing and reasoning over
structured information, supporting a wide range of applications such as
information retrieval, question answering, and decision-making. However, their
effectiveness is often hindered by incompleteness, limiting their potential for
real-world impact. While knowledge graph completion (KGC) has been extensively
studied in the literature, recent advances in generative AI models,
particularly large language models (LLMs), have introduced new opportunities
for innovation. In-context learning has recently emerged as a promising
approach for leveraging pretrained knowledge of LLMs across a range of natural
language processing tasks and has been widely adopted in both academia and
industry. However, how to utilize in-context learning for effective KGC remains
relatively underexplored. We develop a novel method that incorporates
topological information through in-context learning to enhance KGC performance.
By integrating ontological knowledge and graph structure into the context of
LLMs, our approach achieves strong performance in the transductive setting
i.e., nodes in the test graph dataset are present in the training graph
dataset. Furthermore, we apply our approach to KGC in the more challenging
inductive setting, i.e., nodes in the training graph dataset and test graph
dataset are disjoint, leveraging the ontology to infer useful information about
missing nodes which serve as contextual cues for the LLM during inference. Our
method demonstrates superior performance compared to baselines on the
ILPC-small and ILPC-large datasets.},

Abstract      = {Over the past two decades, the Web Ontology Language (OWL) has been
instrumental in advancing the development of ontologies and knowledge graphs,
providing a structured framework that enhances the semantic integration of
data. However, the reliability of deductive reasoning within these systems
remains challenging, as evidenced by inconsistencies among popular reasoners in
recent competitions. This evidence underscores the limitations of current
testing-based methodologies, particularly in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we have developed VEL, a
formally verified EL++ reasoner equipped with machine-checkable correctness
proofs that ensure the validity of outputs across all possible inputs. This
formalization, based on the algorithm of Baader et al., has been transformed
into executable OCaml code using the Coq proof assistant's extraction
capabilities. Our formalization revealed several errors in the original
completeness proofs, which led to changes to the algorithm to ensure its
completeness. Our work demonstrates the necessity of mechanization of reasoning
algorithms to ensure their correctness at theoretical and implementation
levels.},

Abstract      = {Ontologies of research topics are crucial for structuring scientific
knowledge, enabling scientists to navigate vast amounts of research, and
forming the backbone of intelligent systems such as search engines and
recommendation systems. However, manual creation of these ontologies is
expensive, slow, and often results in outdated and overly general
representations. As a solution, researchers have been investigating ways to
automate or semi-automate the process of generating these ontologies. This
paper offers a comprehensive analysis of the ability of large language models
(LLMs) to identify semantic relationships between different research topics,
which is a critical step in the development of such ontologies. To this end, we
developed a gold standard based on the IEEE Thesaurus to evaluate the task of
identifying four types of relationships between pairs of topics: broader,
narrower, same-as, and other. Our study evaluates the performance of seventeen
LLMs, which differ in scale, accessibility (open vs. proprietary), and model
type (full vs. quantised), while also assessing four zero-shot reasoning
strategies. Several models have achieved outstanding results, including
Mixtral-8x7B, Dolphin-Mistral-7B, and Claude 3 Sonnet, with F1-scores of 0.847,
0.920, and 0.967, respectively. Furthermore, our findings demonstrate that
smaller, quantised models, when optimised through prompt engineering, can
deliver performance comparable to much larger proprietary models, while
requiring significantly fewer computational resources.},

these challenges, we propose CyberRAG, an ontology-aware retrieval-augmented

cybersecurity education. CyberRAG employs a two-step approach: first, it
augments the domain-specific knowledge by retrieving validated cybersecurity
documents from a knowledge base to enhance the relevance and accuracy of the
response. Second, it mitigates hallucinations and misuse by integrating a
knowledge graph ontology to validate the final answer. Experiments on publicly

exact match accuracy with GPT-4o and 60% with Llama 3.1 70B. We investigate
knowledge grounding through drug definitions, finding modest improvements in
accuracy. Further, we show that fine-tuned Llama 3.1 8B matches zero-shot Llama
3.1 70B accuracy, suggesting that effective ATC coding is feasible with smaller

Abstract      = {Ontology-based knowledge graphs (KG) are desirable for effective knowledge
management and reuse in various decision making scenarios, including design.
Creating and populating extensive KG based on specific ontological models can
be highly labour and time-intensive unless automated processes are developed
for knowledge extraction and graph creation. Most research and development on
automated extraction and creation of KG is based on extensive unstructured data
sets that provide contextual information. However, some of the most useful
information about the products and services of a company has traditionally been
recorded as structured data. Such structured data sets rarely follow a standard
ontology, do not capture explicit mapping of relationships between the
entities, and provide no contextual information. Therefore, this research
reports a method and digital workflow developed to address this gap. The
developed method and workflow employ rule-based techniques to extract and
create a Function Behaviour-Structure (FBS) ontology-based KG from legacy
structured data, especially specification sheets and product catalogues. The
solution approach consists of two main components: a process for deriving
context and context-based classification rules for FBS ontology concepts and a
workflow for populating and retrieving the FBS ontology-based KG. KG and
Natural Language Processing (NLP) are used to automate knowledge extraction,
representation, and retrieval. The workflow's effectiveness is demonstrated via
pilot implementation in an industrial context. Insights gained from the pilot

have developed numerous automatic annotation systems, particularly deep

address this issue. In this work, we propose a transformer-based fusion model
capable of predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms from full-scale protein
sequences, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy compared to other contemporary
machine learning annotation systems. The approach performs particularly well on
clustered split datasets, which comprise training and testing samples
originating from distinct distributions that are structurally diverse. This
demonstrates that the model is able to understand both short and long term
dependencies within the enzyme's structure and can precisely identify the
motifs associated with the various GO terms. Furthermore, the technique is
lightweight and less computationally expensive compared to the benchmark
methods, while at the same time not unaffected by sequence length, rendering it
appropriate for diverse applications with varying sequence lengths.},

multiple domains, we propose to explain LP models in KG with path-based
explanations. An integrated framework, namely eXpath, is introduced which
incorporates the concept of relation path with ontological closed path rules to
enhance both the efficiency and effectiveness of LP interpretation. Notably,
the eXpath explanations can be fused with other single-link explanation
approaches to achieve a better overall solution. Extensive experiments across
benchmark datasets and LP models demonstrate that introducing eXpath can boost
the quality of resulting explanations by about 20% on two key metrics and
reduce the required explanation time by 61.4%, in comparison to the best
existing method. Case studies further highlight eXpath's ability to provide

analysed using clinical codes (ICD10, SNOMED), however these can differ across
registries and healthcare providers. Integrating data across systems involves
mapping between different clinical ontologies requiring domain expertise, and
at times resulting in data loss. To overcome this, code-agnostic models have
been proposed. We assess the effectiveness of a code-agnostic representation
approach on the task of long-term microvascular complication prediction for
individuals living with Type 2 Diabetes. Our method encodes individual EHRs as
text using fine-tuned, pretrained clinical language models. Leveraging
large-scale EHR data from the UK, we employ a multi-label approach to
simultaneously predict the risk of microvascular complications across 1-, 5-,
and 10-year windows. We demonstrate that a code-agnostic approach outperforms a
code-based model and illustrate that performance is better with longer
prediction windows but is biased to the first occurring complication. Overall,
we highlight that context length is vitally important for model performance.

clinical ontologies and is a starting point for generalisable clinical models.},

expressed as disjunctions of conjunctions (using the $\sqcup$ operator).
Moreover, SPILDL's hypothesis language also incorporates the use of string
concrete roles (also known as string data properties in the Web Ontology
Language, OWL); As a result, this incorporation of powerful DL constructs,
enables SPILDL to learn powerful DL-based hypotheses for describing many
real-world complex concepts. SPILDL employs a hybrid parallel approach which
combines both shared-memory and distributed-memory approaches, to accelerates
ILP learning (for both hypothesis search and evaluation). According to
experimental results, SPILDL's parallel search improved performance by up to
$\sim$27.3 folds (best case). For hypothesis evaluation, SPILDL improved
evaluation performance through HT-HEDL (our multi-core CPU + multi-GPU
hypothesis evaluation engine), by up to 38 folds (best case). By combining both
parallel search and evaluation, SPILDL improved performance by up to $\sim$560
folds (best case). In terms of worst case scenario, SPILDL's parallel search
doesn't provide consistent speedups on all datasets, and is highly dependent on
the search space nature of the ILP dataset. For some datasets, increasing the
number of parallel search threads result in reduced performance, similar or
worse than baseline. Some ILP datasets benefit from parallel search, while
others don't (or the performance gains are negligible). In terms of parallel
evaluation, on small datasets, parallel evaluation provide similar or worse

Traditional Scheme in RDFs and SPARQL, fit to handle irresolvable conflicts,
i.e., situations in which two or more statements prescribe conflicting
obligations, prohibitions, or permissions, with none of them being "stronger"
than the other one(s). In our view, this paper marks a significant advancement
in standard theoretical research in formal Deontic Logic. Most contemporary
approaches in this field are confined to the propositional level, mainly focus
on the notion of obligation, and lack implementations. The proposed framework
is encoded in RDF, which is not only a first-order language but also the most
widely used knowledge representation language, as it forms the foundation of
the Semantic Web. Moreover, the proposed computational ontology formalizes all
deontic modalities defined in the Deontic Traditional Scheme, without
specifically focusing on obligations, and offers constructs to model and reason
with various types of irresolvable conflicts, violations, and the interaction
between deontic modalities and contextual constraints in a given state of
affairs. To the best of our knowledge, no existing approach in the literature

Abstract      = {In recent years, graph representation learning has undergone a paradigm
shift, driven by the emergence and proliferation of graph neural networks
(GNNs) and their heterogeneous counterparts. Heterogeneous GNNs have shown
remarkable success in extracting low-dimensional embeddings from complex graphs
that encompass diverse entity types and relationships. While meta-path-based
techniques have long been recognized for their ability to capture semantic
affinities among nodes, their dependence on manual specification poses a
significant limitation. In contrast, matrix-focused methods accelerate
processing by utilizing structural cues but often overlook contextual richness.
In this paper, we challenge the current paradigm by introducing ontology as a
fundamental semantic primitive within complex graphs. Our goal is to integrate
the strengths of both matrix-centric and meta-path-based approaches into a
unified framework. We propose perturbation Ontology-based Graph Attention
Networks (POGAT), a novel methodology that combines ontology subgraphs with an
advanced self-supervised learning paradigm to achieve a deep contextual
understanding. The core innovation of POGAT lies in our enhanced homogeneous
perturbing scheme designed to generate rigorous negative samples, encouraging
the model to explore minimal contextual features more thoroughly. Through
extensive empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that POGAT significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a groundbreaking improvement
of up to 10.78\% in F1-score for the critical task of link prediction and
12.01\% in Micro-F1 for the critical task of node classification.},

Abstract      = {Procedural Knowledge is the know-how expressed in the form of sequences of

of natural language texts, such as recipes or maintenance manuals, possibly
spread across different documents and systems, and their interpretation and

in a Knowledge Graph (KG) can be the basis to build digital tools to support
those users who need to apply or execute them. In this paper, we leverage Large
Language Model (LLM) capabilities and propose a prompt engineering approach to
extract steps, actions, objects, equipment and temporal information from a
textual procedure, in order to populate a Procedural KG according to a
pre-defined ontology. We evaluate the KG extraction results by means of a user
study, in order to qualitatively and quantitatively assess the perceived
quality and usefulness of the LLM-extracted procedural knowledge. We show that
LLMs can produce outputs of acceptable quality and we assess the subjective
perception of AI by human evaluators.},

Abstract      = {Cyberattacks are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and prevent due to
their sophistication. In response, Autonomous Intelligent Cyber-defense Agents
(AICAs) are emerging as crucial solutions. One prominent AICA agent is the
Intrusion Response System (IRS), which is critical for mitigating threats after
detection. IRS uses several Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) to
mitigate attacks and restore the infrastructure to normal operations.
Continuous monitoring of the enterprise infrastructure is an essential TTP the
IRS uses. However, each system serves different purposes to meet operational
needs. Integrating these disparate sources for continuous monitoring increases
pre-processing complexity and limits automation, eventually prolonging critical
response time for attackers to exploit. We propose a unified IRS Knowledge
Graph ontology (IRSKG) that streamlines the onboarding of new enterprise
systems as a source for the AICAs. Our ontology can capture system monitoring
logs and supplemental data, such as a rules repository containing the
administrator-defined policies to dictate the IRS responses. Besides, our
ontology permits us to incorporate dynamic changes to adapt to the evolving
cyber-threat landscape. This robust yet concise design allows machine learning
models to train effectively and recover a compromised system to its desired

Abstract      = {In this study, we propose HOPER (HOlistic ProtEin Representation), a novel

compounded by the limited availability of labeled data. Traditional machine
learning models already struggle in such cases, and while deep learning models
excel with abundant data, they also face difficulties when data is scarce.
HOPER addresses this issue by integrating three distinct modalities - protein
sequences, biomedical text, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks - to
create a comprehensive protein representation. The model utilizes autoencoders
to generate holistic embeddings, which are then employed for PFP tasks using
transfer learning. HOPER outperforms existing methods on a benchmark dataset
across all Gene Ontology categories, i.e., molecular function, biological
process, and cellular component. Additionally, we demonstrate its practical
utility by identifying new immune-escape proteins in lung adenocarcinoma,
offering insights into potential therapeutic targets. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of multimodal representation learning for overcoming data

Abstract      = {Knowledge Graph Embedding models, representing entities and edges in a

training most of these models is teaching to discriminate between true

negatives can be defined is not trivial, as facts missing from the KG are not
necessarily false and a set of ground truth negatives is hardly ever given.
This makes synthetic negative generation a necessity. Different generation
strategies can heavily affect the quality of the embeddings, making it a
primary aspect to consider. We revamp a strategy that generates corruptions

Abstract      = {Datalog is a popular logic programming language for deductive reasoning tasks
in a wide array of applications, including business analytics, program

facts over atomic constants leads to challenges in working with tree-structured
data, such as derivation trees or abstract syntax trees. To ameliorate
Datalog's restrictions, popular extensions of Datalog support features such as
existential quantification in rule heads (Datalog$^\pm$, Datalog$^\exists$) or
algebraic data types (Souffl\'e). Unfortunately, these are imperfect solutions
for reasoning over structured and recursive data types, with general
existentials leading to complex implementations requiring unification, and ADTs
unable to trigger rule evaluation and failing to support efficient indexing.
  We present DL$^{\exists!}$, a Datalog with first-class facts, wherein every
fact is identified with a Skolem term unique to the fact. We show that this
restriction offers an attractive price point for Datalog-based reasoning over
tree-shaped data, demonstrating its application to databases, artificial
intelligence, and programming languages. We implemented DL$^{\exists!}$ as a
system \slog{}, which leverages the uniqueness restriction of DL$^{\exists!}$
to enable a communication-avoiding, massively-parallel implementation built on

Abstract      = {A policy knowledge graph can provide decision support for tasks such as

methods of policy knowledge graphs. This paper, focusing on the forestry field,
designs a complete policy knowledge graph construction framework, including:
firstly, proposing a fine-grained forestry policy domain ontology; then,
proposing an unsupervised policy information extraction method, and finally,
constructing a complete forestry policy knowledge graph. The experimental
results show that the proposed ontology has good expressiveness and
extensibility, and the policy information extraction method proposed in this
paper achieves better results than other unsupervised methods. Furthermore, by
analyzing the application of the knowledge graph in the
retrieval-augmented-generation task of the large language models, the practical
application value of the knowledge graph in the era of large language models is
confirmed. The knowledge graph resource will be released on an open-source
platform and can serve as the basic knowledge base for forestry policy-related
intelligent systems. It can also be used for academic research. In addition,
this study can provide reference and guidance for the construction of policy

Abstract      = {Several initiatives have been undertaken to conceptually model the domain of
scholarly data using ontologies and to create respective Knowledge Graphs. Yet,
the full potential seems unleashed, as automated means for automatic population
of said ontologies are lacking, and respective initiatives from the Semantic
Web community are not necessarily connected: we propose to make scholarly data
more sustainably accessible by leveraging Wikidata's infrastructure and
automating its population in a sustainable manner through LLMs by tapping into
unstructured sources like conference Web sites and proceedings texts as well as
already existing structured conference datasets. While an initial analysis
shows that Semantic Web conferences are only minimally represented in Wikidata,
we argue that our methodology can help to populate, evolve and maintain
scholarly data as a community within Wikidata. Our main contributions include
(a) an analysis of ontologies for representing scholarly data to identify gaps
and relevant entities/properties in Wikidata, (b) semi-automated extraction --
requiring (minimal) manual validation -- of conference metadata (e.g.,
acceptance rates, organizer roles, programme committee members, best paper
awards, keynotes, and sponsors) from websites and proceedings texts using LLMs.
Finally, we discuss (c) extensions to visualization tools in the Wikidata
context for data exploration of the generated scholarly data. Our study focuses
on data from 105 Semantic Web-related conferences and extends/adds more than
6000 entities in Wikidata. It is important to note that the method can be more
generally applicable beyond Semantic Web-related conferences for enhancing
Wikidata's utility as a comprehensive scholarly resource.

Abstract      = {Sound event localization and detection (SELD) has seen substantial
advancements through learning-based methods. These systems, typically trained
from scratch on specific datasets, have shown considerable generalization
capabilities. Recently, deep neural networks trained on large-scale datasets
have achieved remarkable success in the sound event classification (SEC) field,
prompting an open question of whether these advances can be extended to the
development of SELD foundation models. In this paper, leveraging the power of
pre-trained SEC models, we propose pre-trained SELD networks (PSELDNets) on a
large-scale synthetic dataset. The synthetic dataset, generated by convolving
sound events with simulated spatial room impulse responses (SRIRs), contains
1,167 hours of audio clips with an ontology of 170 sound classes. These
PSELDNets are applied to various SELD scenarios. When we adapt PSELDNets to
specific scenarios, particularly in cases of low-resource data, we introduce a
data-efficient fine-tuning method, AdapterBit. PSELDNets are evaluated on
synthetic-test-set using collected SRIRs from the TAU Spatial Room Impulse
Response Database (TAU-SRIR DB) and achieve satisfactory performance. We also
carried out experiments to validate the transferability of PSELDNets to three
publicly available datasets and our own real-world recordings. The results
demonstrate that PSELDNets surpass state-of-the-art systems across all publicly
available datasets. Given the need for direction-of-arrival estimation, SELD
generally relies on sufficient multi-channel audio clips. However,
incorporating the AdapterBit, PSELDNets show more efficient adaptability to
various scenarios using minimal multi-channel or even just monophonic audio
clips, outperforming traditional fine-tuning approaches.},

Abstract      = {Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual
alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in
Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists,
highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X,
a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities
for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual
schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different
languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation
task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the
translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual
transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and
diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER,
synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation
to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages,
KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby
demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations
on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate
that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through
boosting the IE alignment. Our code and dataset are available at:

we survey a large body of work spanning 133 datasets in over 100 languages,
creating a novel ontology covering sample properties, collection methods and
distribution. With this ontology we make key observations, including the lack
in accessible high-quality datasets for low-resource languages, and the field's
over-reliance on the news domain and on automatically collected distant
supervision. Finally, we make available a web interface that allows users to
interact and explore our ontology and dataset collection, as well as a template

Eprint        = {2411.03962v8},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},

Abstract      = {The classical text preprocessing pipeline, comprising Tokenisation,
Normalisation, Stop Words Removal, and Stemming/Lemmatisation, has been
implemented in many systems for syntactic ontology matching (OM). However, the
lack of standardisation in text preprocessing creates diversity in mapping
results. In this paper, we investigate the effect of the text preprocessing
pipeline on syntactic OM in 8 Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI)
tracks with 49 distinct alignments. We find that Phase 1 text preprocessing
(Tokenisation and Normalisation) is more effective than Phase 2 text
preprocessing (Stop Words Removal and Stemming/Lemmatisation). We propose two
novel approaches to repair unwanted false mappings caused by Phase 2 text
preprocessing. One is an ad hoc logic-based repair approach that employs an
ontology-specific check to find common words that cause false mappings. These
words are stored in a reserved word set and applied before the text
preprocessing. By leveraging the power of large language models (LLMs), we also
propose a post hoc LLM-based repair approach. This approach utilises the strong
background knowledge provided by LLMs to repair non-existent and
counter-intuitive false mappings after the text preprocessing. It also
overcomes the tendency towards unstable true mappings by injecting the
classical text preprocessing pipeline via function calling. The experimental
results show that these two approaches can improve the matching correctness and
the overall matching performance.},

quantum field theory, that there is for each of our energy scales a pair of
associated terms in the Lagrangian density, one "kinetic" and one "mass- or

$a$.We take it Gaussian in the logarithm, $\ln(a)$. A fluctuating lattice is
very natural in a theory with general relativity, since it corresponds to
fluctuations in the gauge d.o.f. of general relativity. Intriguing are the
lowest ones of our energy scales, being by us not described by quantum field
theory as the other ones, but by actions for single particle or single string
respectivily, because the string scale fits well with hadronic strings, and the
particle scale is presumably the mass scale of Standard Model group monopoles,

Abstract      = {Biomedical research requires large, diverse samples to produce unbiased
results. Automated methods for matching variables across datasets can
accelerate this process. Research in this area has been limited, primarily
focusing on lexical matching and ontology based semantic matching. We aimed to
develop new methods, leveraging large language models (LLM) and ensemble
learning, to automate variable matching. Methods: We utilized data from two
GERAS cohort (European and Japan) studies to develop variable matching methods.
We first manually created a dataset by matching 352 EU variables with 1322
candidate JP variables, where matched variable pairs were positive and
unmatched pairs were negative instances. Using this dataset, we developed and
evaluated two types of natural language processing (NLP) methods, which matched
variables based on variable labels and definitions from data dictionaries: (1)
LLM-based and (2) fuzzy matching. We then developed an ensemble-learning
method, using the Random Forest model, to integrate individual NLP methods. RF
was trained and evaluated on 50 trials. Each trial had a random split (4:1) of
training and test sets, with the model's hyperparameters optimized through
cross-validation on the training set. For each EU variable, 1322 candidate JP
variables were ranked based on NLP-derived similarity scores or RF's
probability scores, denoting their likelihood to match the EU variable. Ranking
performance was measured by top-n hit ratio (HRn) and mean reciprocal rank
(MRR). Results:E5 performed best among individual methods, achieving 0.90 HR-30
and 0.70 MRR. RF performed better than E5 on all metrics over 50 trials (P less
than 0.001) and achieved an average HR 30 of 0.98 and MRR of 0.73. LLM-derived
features contributed most to RF's performance. One major cause of errors in
automatic variable matching was ambiguous variable definitions within data
dictionaries.},

However, their tendency to ``hallucinate'' can produce inaccurate outputs.
Despite these limitations, LLMs offer rapid and scalable processing of natural

approximate human-level performance in extracting and structuring data for KGs.
This study investigates LLM effectiveness for the KG population, focusing on
the Enslaved.org Hub Ontology. In this paper, we report that compared to the

Furthermore, we employ reinforcement learning from human feedback to further

Abstract      = {Narratives are key interpretative devices by which humans make sense of

evident, there is a growing demand for methods that support their empirical
analysis. To this end, we propose a graph-based formalism and machine-guided
method for extracting, representing, and analyzing selected narrative signals
from digital textual corpora, based on Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR).
The formalism and method introduced here specifically cater to the study of
political narratives that figure in texts from digital media such as archived
political speeches, social media posts, political manifestos and transcripts of
parliamentary debates. We conceptualize these political narratives as a type of
ontological narratives: stories by which actors position themselves as
political beings, and which are akin to political worldviews in which actors
present their normative vision of the world, or aspects thereof. We approach
the study of such political narratives as a problem of information retrieval:
starting from a textual corpus, we first extract a graph-like representation of
the meaning of each sentence in the corpus using AMR. Drawing on transferable
concepts from narratology, we then apply a set of heuristics to filter these
graphs for representations of 1) actors, 2) the events in which these actors
figure, and 3) traces of the perspectivization of these events. We approach
these references to actors, events, and instances of perspectivization as core
narrative signals that initiate a further analysis by alluding to larger
political narratives. By means of a case study of State of the European Union
addresses, we demonstrate how the formalism can be used to inductively surface
signals of political narratives from public discourse.},

Abstract      = {Understanding animal vocalizations through multi-source data fusion is

by employing multi-modal data fusion techniques, integrating transcription,

extraction. We utilized the Natural Language Processing model to transcribe
audio recordings of cow vocalizations into written form. By fusing multiple
acoustic features frequency, duration, and intensity with transcribed textual
data, we developed a comprehensive representation of cow vocalizations.
Utilizing data fusion within a custom-developed ontology, we categorized
vocalizations into high frequency calls associated with distress or arousal,
and low frequency calls linked to contentment or calmness. Analyzing the fused
multi dimensional data, we identified anxiety related features indicative of
emotional distress, including specific frequency measurements and sound
spectrum results. Assessing the sentiment and acoustic features of
vocalizations from 20 individual cows allowed us to determine differences in
calling patterns and emotional states. Employing advanced machine learning
algorithms, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Recurrent Neural
Networks, we effectively processed and fused multi-source data to classify cow
vocalizations. These models were optimized to handle computational demands and
data quality challenges inherent in practical farm environments. Our findings
demonstrate the effectiveness of multi-source data fusion and intelligent

However, this partial ontology learning does not capture the interactions
between subtasks. We address this gap by introducing OLLM, a general and
scalable method for building the taxonomic backbone of an ontology from
scratch. Rather than focusing on subtasks, like individual relations between
entities, we model entire subcomponents of the target ontology by finetuning an
LLM with a custom regulariser that reduces overfitting on high-frequency
concepts. We introduce a novel suite of metrics for evaluating the quality of
the generated ontology by measuring its semantic and structural similarity to
the ground truth. In contrast to standard metrics, our metrics use deep
learning techniques to define more robust distance measures between graphs.
Both our quantitative and qualitative results on Wikipedia show that OLLM
outperforms subtask composition methods, producing more semantically accurate
ontologies while maintaining structural integrity. We further demonstrate that
our model can be effectively adapted to new domains, like arXiv, needing only a

Abstract      = {Textual descriptions in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, such as
security articles and news, are rich sources of knowledge about cyber threats,
crucial for organizations to stay informed about the rapidly evolving threat
landscape. However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility
and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge
extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model
fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms
challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we
propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning
(ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge
extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction.
Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter
tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples.
This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt
construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a
wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity
alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes
redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further
complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150
real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus
significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and
complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an
efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.},

disease mentions, and the integration of LLMs, particularly with Few Shot

raises an important research question: Will medical knowledge improve
predictive models to support stepwise clinical reasoning as performed by human

that combines two complementary sources of information. For external knowledge,
we construct a Diagnosis Knowledge Graph (KG) that encodes both hierarchical

patient data, we further introduce a lab-informed proxy task that guides the
model to follow a clinically consistent, stepwise reasoning process based on
lab test signals. Experimental results on two public EHR datasets demonstrate
that DuaLK consistently outperforms existing baselines across four clinical
prediction tasks. These findings highlight the potential of combining
structured medical knowledge with individual-level clinical signals to achieve
more accurate and interpretable diagnostic predictions. The source code is

comparing them to similar problems available from historical records. Since

Abstract      = {Leveraging Large Language Models (LLM) like GPT4 in the auto generation of
code represents a significant advancement, yet it is not without its
challenges. The ambiguity inherent in natural language descriptions of software
poses substantial obstacles to generating deployable, structured artifacts.
This research champions Model Driven Development (MDD) as a viable strategy to
overcome these challenges, proposing an Agile Model Driven Development (AMDD)
approach that employs GPT4 as a code generator. This approach enhances the
flexibility and scalability of the code auto generation process and offers
agility that allows seamless adaptation to changes in models or deployment
environments. We illustrate this by modeling a multi agent Unmanned Vehicle
Fleet (UVF) system using the Unified Modeling Language (UML), significantly
reducing model ambiguity by integrating the Object Constraint Language (OCL)
for code structure meta modeling, and the FIPA ontology language for
communication semantics meta modeling. Applying GPT4 auto generation
capabilities yields Java and Python code that is compatible with the JADE and
PADE frameworks, respectively. Our thorough evaluation of the auto generated
code verifies its alignment with expected behaviors and identifies enhancements
in agent interactions. Structurally, we assessed the complexity of code derived
from a model constrained solely by OCL meta models, against that influenced by
both OCL and FIPA ontology meta models. The results indicate that the ontology
constrained meta model produces inherently more complex code, yet its
cyclomatic complexity remains within manageable levels, suggesting that
additional meta model constraints can be incorporated without exceeding the
high risk threshold for complexity.},

introduce the first multilingual Event Extraction (EE) framework SPEED++ for
extracting epidemic event information for a wide range of diseases and
languages. To this end, we extend a previous epidemic ontology with 20 argument
roles; and curate our multilingual EE dataset SPEED++ comprising 5.1K tweets in
four languages for four diseases. Annotating data in every language is
infeasible; thus we develop zero-shot cross-lingual cross-disease models (i.e.,
training only on English COVID data) utilizing multilingual pre-training and
show their efficacy in extracting epidemic-related events for 65 diverse
languages across different diseases. Experiments demonstrate that our framework
can provide epidemic warnings for COVID-19 in its earliest stages in Dec 2019
(3 weeks before global discussions) from Chinese Weibo posts without any
training in Chinese. Furthermore, we exploit our framework's argument
extraction capabilities to aggregate community epidemic discussions like
symptoms and cure measures, aiding misinformation detection and public

position statements and review papers detailing the needs of end-users for
user-centered explainability but fewer implementations. Hence, this thesis
seeks to bridge some gaps between model and user-centered explainability. We
create an explanation ontology (EO) to represent literature-derived explanation
types via their supporting components. We implement a knowledge-augmented
question-answering (QA) pipeline to support contextual explanations in a
clinical setting. Finally, we are implementing a system to combine explanations
from different AI methods and data modalities. Within the EO, we can represent
fifteen different explanation types, and we have tested these representations
in six exemplar use cases. We find that knowledge augmentations improve the
performance of base large language models in the contextualized QA, and the
performance is variable across disease groups. In the same setting, clinicians
also indicated that they prefer to see actionability as one of the main foci in
explanations. In our explanations combination method, we plan to use similarity
metrics to determine the similarity of explanations in a chronic disease
detection setting. Overall, through this thesis, we design methods that can
support knowledge-enabled explanations across different use cases, accounting
for the methods in today's AI era that can generate the supporting components
of these explanations and domain knowledge sources that can enhance them.},

overcome these limitations, we propose SynthKG, a multi-step, document-level

a single-step KG generation approach called Distill-SynthKG, substantially
reducing the number of LLM inference calls. Furthermore, we re-purpose existing

specially designed score functions. However, they often neglect the embedding
of complex concepts, making it difficult to infer with more intricate axioms.
This limitation reduces their effectiveness in advanced reasoning tasks, such

propose EL++-closed ontology embeddings which are able to represent any logical
expressions in DL via composition. Furthermore, we develop TransBox, an

Abstract      = {Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive potential in helping with
numerous medical challenges. Deploying LLMs in high-stakes applications such as
medicine, however, brings in many concerns. One major area of concern relates
to biased behaviors of LLMs in medical applications, leading to unfair
treatment of individuals. To pave the way for the responsible and impactful
deployment of Med LLMs, rigorous evaluation is a key prerequisite. Due to the
huge complexity and variability of different medical scenarios, existing work
in this domain has primarily relied on using manually crafted datasets for bias
evaluation. In this study, we present a new method to scale up such bias
evaluations by automatically generating test cases based on rigorous medical
evidence. We specifically target the challenges of a) domain-specificity of
bias characterization, b) hallucinating while generating the test cases, and c)
various dependencies between the health outcomes and sensitive attributes. To
that end, we offer new methods to address these challenges integrated with our
generative pipeline, using medical knowledge graphs, medical ontologies, and
customized general LLM evaluation frameworks in our method. Through a series of
extensive experiments, we show that the test cases generated by our proposed
method can effectively reveal bias patterns in Med LLMs at larger and more
flexible scales than human-crafted datasets. We publish a large bias evaluation
dataset using our pipeline, which is dedicated to a few medical case studies. A
live demo of our application for vignette generation is available at

Abstract      = {Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is the most frequent cause of disease among biliary
tract neoplasms. Identifying the molecular mechanisms and biomarkers linked to
GBC progression has been a significant challenge in scientific research. Few
recent studies have explored the roles of biomarkers in GBC. Our study aimed to
identify biomarkers in GBC using machine learning (ML) and bioinformatics
techniques. We compared GBC tumor samples with normal samples to identify
differentially expressed genes (DEGs) from two microarray datasets (GSE100363,
GSE139682) obtained from the NCBI GEO database. A total of 146 DEGs were found,
with 39 up-regulated and 107 down-regulated genes. Functional enrichment
analysis of these DEGs was performed using Gene Ontology (GO) terms and
REACTOME pathways through DAVID. The protein-protein interaction network was
constructed using the STRING database. To identify hub genes, we applied three
ranking algorithms: Degree, MNC, and Closeness Centrality. The intersection of
hub genes from these algorithms yielded 11 hub genes. Simultaneously, two
feature selection methods (Pearson correlation and recursive feature
elimination) were used to identify significant gene subsets. We then developed
ML models using SVM and RF on the GSE100363 dataset, with validation on
GSE139682, to determine the gene subset that best distinguishes GBC samples.
The hub genes outperformed the other gene subsets. Finally, NTRK2, COL14A1,
SCN4B, ATP1A2, SLC17A7, SLIT3, COL7A1, CLDN4, CLEC3B, ADCYAP1R1, and MFAP4 were
identified as crucial genes, with SLIT3, COL7A1, and CLDN4 being strongly
linked to GBC development and prediction.},

Abstract      = {Syllogistic reasoning is crucial for Natural Language Inference (NLI). This
capability is particularly significant in specialized domains such as
biomedicine, where it can support automatic evidence interpretation and
scientific discovery. This paper presents SylloBio-NLI, a novel framework that
leverages external ontologies to systematically instantiate diverse syllogistic
arguments for biomedical NLI. We employ SylloBio-NLI to evaluate Large Language
Models (LLMs) on identifying valid conclusions and extracting supporting
evidence across 28 syllogistic schemes instantiated with human genome pathways.
Extensive experiments reveal that biomedical syllogistic reasoning is
particularly challenging for zero-shot LLMs, which achieve an average accuracy
between 70% on generalized modus ponens and 23% on disjunctive syllogism. At
the same time, we found that few-shot prompting can boost the performance of
different LLMs, including Gemma (+14%) and LLama-3 (+43%). However, a deeper
analysis shows that both techniques exhibit high sensitivity to superficial
lexical variations, highlighting a dependency between reliability, models'
architecture, and pre-training regime. Overall, our results indicate that,
while in-context examples have the potential to elicit syllogistic reasoning in
LLMs, existing models are still far from achieving the robustness and
consistency required for safe biomedical NLI applications.},

Abstract      = {The ability to reason with and integrate different sensory inputs is the
foundation underpinning human intelligence and it is the reason for the growing
interest in modelling multi-modal information within Knowledge Graphs.
Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs extend traditional Knowledge Graphs by associating
an entity with its possible modal representations, including text, images,
audio, and videos, all of which are used to convey the semantics of the entity.
Despite the increasing attention that Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs have
received, there is a lack of consensus about the definitions and modelling of
modalities, whose definition is often determined by application domains. In
this paper, we propose a novel ontology design pattern that captures the
separation of concerns between an entity (and the information it conveys),
whose semantics can have different manifestations across different media, and
its realisation in terms of a physical information entity. By introducing this
abstract model, we aim to facilitate the harmonisation and integration of
different existing multi-modal ontologies which is crucial for many intelligent
applications across different domains spanning from medicine to digital
humanities.},

Abstract      = {We introduce LLMD, a large language model designed to analyze a patient's
medical history based on their medical records. Along with domain knowledge,
LLMD is trained on a large corpus of records collected over time and across
facilities, as well as tasks and labels that make nuanced connections among
them. This approach is critical to an accurate picture of patient health, and
has distinctive advantages over models trained on knowledge alone, unlabeled
records, structured EHR data, or records from a single health system.
  The recipe for LLMD continues pretraining a foundational model on both domain
knowledge and the contents of millions of records. These span an average of 10
years of care and as many as 140 care sites per patient. LLMD is then
instruction fine-tuned on structuring and abstraction tasks. The former jointly
identify and normalize document metadata, provenance information, clinical
named-entities, and ontology mappings, while the latter roll these into
higher-level representations, such a continuous era of time a patient was on a
medication. LLMD is deployed within a layered validation system that includes
continual random audits and review by experts, e.g. based on uncertainty,
disease-specific rules, or use-case.
  LLMD exhibits large gains over both more-powerful generalized models and
domain-specific models. On medical knowledge benchmarks, LLMD-8B achieves state
of the art accuracy on PubMedQA text responses, besting orders-of-magnitude
larger models. On production tasks, we show that LLMD significantly outperforms
all other models evaluated, and among alternatives, large general purpose LLMs
like GPT-4o are more accurate than models emphasizing medical knowledge. We
find strong evidence that accuracy on today's medical benchmarks is not the
most significant factor when analyzing real-world patient data, an insight with
implications for future medical LLMs.'},

representation learning output into initial entity embedding of a neural

continuously trains the model to fit observed facts. We prove nonasymptotic
bounds for in-sample and out-of-sample weighted MSEs in relation to the
pseudo-dimension of the knowledge graph function class. Additionally, we
provide pseudo-dimensions for score functions based on multilayer neural
networks with ReLU activation function, in the scenarios when the embedding

Abstract      = {Ontologies often lack explicit disjointness declarations between classes,
despite their usefulness for sophisticated reasoning and consistency checking
in Knowledge Graphs. In this study, we explore the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs) to enrich ontologies by identifying and asserting class
disjointness axioms. Our approach aims at leveraging the implicit knowledge
embedded in LLMs, using prompt engineering to elicit this knowledge for
classifying ontological disjointness. We validate our methodology on the
DBpedia ontology, focusing on open-source LLMs. Our findings suggest that LLMs,
when guided by effective prompt strategies, can reliably identify disjoint
class relationships, thus streamlining the process of ontology completion
without extensive manual input. For comprehensive disjointness enrichment, we
propose a process that takes logical relationships between disjointness and
subclass statements into account in order to maintain satisfiability and reduce
the number of calls to the LLM. This work provides a foundation for future
applications of LLMs in automated ontology enhancement and offers insights into
optimizing LLM performance through strategic prompt design. Our code is

Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are pre-trained on large-scale corpora and excel
in numerous general natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as question
answering (QA). Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to
domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations,
knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine
tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and
time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has
recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by
referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a
Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into
account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured
manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM
framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store
factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in
the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of
LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with
automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG
(containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured
information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that
attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need
for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks.
We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is
designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In
this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework
on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly
detection.},

Abstract      = {In this paper I aim to defend one version at least of Hume's dictum: roughly,
the idea that possibility is determined by ontology through something like
independent variation. My defence is broadly pragmatic, in the sense that
adherence to something like Hume's dictum delivers at least three benefits. The
first benefit is that, through Hume's dictum, a physical theory's ontology
delimits a range of possibilities, that I call \emph{kinematical
possibilities}, which serves as a sufficiently permissive notion of possibility
to sustain something like an intensional semantics for its claims, and a
sufficiently demanding notion of supervenience to sustain plausible claims of
inter-theoretic reduction and theoretical equivalence. The second benefit is
that Hume's dictum allows us to work backwards from a range of kinematical
possibilities to an ontology. This is especially useful when aiming to glean an
interpretation of a physical theory, since often we are more confident that we
have arrived at the right space of possibilities than that we have arrived at
the right ontology. The third benefit is that Hume's dictum -- at least the
version I aim to defend here -- may be applied to physical theories more or
less as we find them, and therefore we can practice something resembling
ontology without having to force our theories into some Procrustean bed, such
as a first-order language.},

Abstract      = {Recently, there has been a growing interest in Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) due to their remarkable potential in various tasks integrating
different modalities, such as image and text, as well as applications such as
image captioning and visual question answering. However, such models still face
challenges in accurately captioning and interpreting specific visual concepts
and classes, particularly in domain-specific applications. We argue that
integrating domain knowledge in the form of an ontology can significantly
address these issues. In this work, as a proof of concept, we propose a new
framework that combines ontology with MLLMs to classify images of plant
diseases. Our method uses concepts about plant diseases from an existing
disease ontology to query MLLMs and extract relevant visual concepts from
images. Then, we use the reasoning capabilities of the ontology to classify the
disease according to the identified concepts. Ensuring that the model
accurately uses the concepts describing the disease is crucial in
domain-specific applications. By employing an ontology, we can assist in
verifying this alignment. Additionally, using the ontology's inference
capabilities increases transparency, explainability, and trust in the
decision-making process while serving as a judge by checking if the annotations
of the concepts by MLLMs are aligned with those in the ontology and displaying
the rationales behind their errors. Our framework offers a new direction for
synergizing ontologies and MLLMs, supported by an empirical study using
different well-known MLLMs.},

Abstract      = {From centralised platforms to decentralised ecosystems, like Data Spaces,
sharing data has become a paramount challenge. For this reason, the definition

policies that integrates the descriptive ontology terms of ODRL with other
languages that allow behaviour specification, such as dynamic data handling or
function evaluation. The framework includes an enforcement algorithm for ODRL
policies and two open-source implementations in Python and Java. The ODRE
framework is also designed to support future extensions of ODRL to specific

challenges are reported. Finally, to demonstrate the enforcement capabilities
of the implementations, their performance, and their extensibility features,

Abstract      = {Ontological commitment, i.e., used concepts, relations, and assumptions, are
a corner stone of qualitative reasoning (QR) models. The state-of-the-art for
processing raw inputs, though, are deep neural networks (DNNs), nowadays often
based off from multimodal foundation models. These automatically learn rich
representations of concepts and respective reasoning. Unfortunately, the
learned qualitative knowledge is opaque, preventing easy inspection,
validation, or adaptation against available QR models. So far, it is possible
to associate pre-defined concepts with latent representations of DNNs, but
extractable relations are mostly limited to semantic similarity. As a next step
towards QR for validation and verification of DNNs: Concretely, we propose a
method that extracts the learned superclass hierarchy from a multimodal DNN for
a given set of leaf concepts. Under the hood we (1) obtain leaf concept
embeddings using the DNN's textual input modality; (2) apply hierarchical
clustering to them, using that DNNs encode semantic similarities via vector
distances; and (3) label the such-obtained parent concepts using search in
available ontologies from QR. An initial evaluation study shows that meaningful
ontological class hierarchies can be extracted from state-of-the-art foundation
models. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to validate and verify a DNN's learned
representations against given ontologies. Lastly, we discuss potential future
applications in the context of QR.},

different datasources: an existing Computer Science Ontology (CSO), Wikidata,

to assess the quality of a taxonomy. The outcome measures include the number of
unlinked terms, self-loops, and overall connectivity of the taxonomy. The
results indicate that individual datasources have advantages and drawbacks: the
CSO datasource showed minimal variance across different configurations, but a
notable issue of missing technical terms and a high number of self-loops. The
Wikipedia datasource required significant filtering during construction to
improve metric performance. LLM-generated taxonomies demonstrated better
performance when using context-rich prompts. An ensemble approach showed the
most promise, successfully reducing the number of unlinked terms and
self-loops, thus creating a more connected and comprehensive taxonomy. The
study addresses the construction of a software application domain taxonomy

approach to taxonomy construction can effectively address the limitations of
individual datasources. Future work should focus on refining the ensemble
techniques and exploring additional datasources to enhance the taxonomy's
accuracy and completeness.},

labeled dataset, we finetune a transformer-based text encoder to generate
semantic embeddings of the entities based on the contents of their accounts. We
then exploit this evidence alongside network-based embeddings to predict the
entities semantic types. In our experiments, we show high type prediction
performance on the labeled dataset. Consequently, we apply our type
classification model to all of the entity accounts in the social KB. Our
analysis of the results offers insights about the global semantics of the
Twitter sphere. We discuss downstream applications that should benefit from
semantic type information and the semantic embeddings of social entities
generated in this work. In particular, we demonstrate enhanced performance on
the key task of entity similarity assessment using this information.},

Abstract      = {Addressing Lidar Panoptic Segmentation (LPS ) is crucial for safe deployment
of autonomous vehicles. LPS aims to recognize and segment lidar points w.r.t. a
pre-defined vocabulary of semantic classes, including thing classes of
countable objects (e.g., pedestrians and vehicles) and stuff classes of
amorphous regions (e.g., vegetation and road). Importantly, LPS requires
segmenting individual thing instances (e.g., every single vehicle). Current LPS
methods make an unrealistic assumption that the semantic class vocabulary is
fixed in the real open world, but in fact, class ontologies usually evolve over
time as robots encounter instances of novel classes that are considered to be
unknowns w.r.t. the pre-defined class vocabulary. To address this unrealistic
assumption, we study LPS in the Open World (LiPSOW): we train models on a
dataset with a pre-defined semantic class vocabulary and study their
generalization to a larger dataset where novel instances of thing and stuff
classes can appear. This experimental setting leads to interesting conclusions.
While prior art train class-specific instance segmentation methods and obtain
state-of-the-art results on known classes, methods based on class-agnostic
bottom-up grouping perform favorably on classes outside of the initial class
vocabulary (i.e., unknown classes). Unfortunately, these methods do not perform
on-par with fully data-driven methods on known classes. Our work suggests a
middle ground: we perform class-agnostic point clustering and over-segment the
input cloud in a hierarchical fashion, followed by binary point segment
classification, akin to Region Proposal Network [1]. We obtain the final point
cloud segmentation by computing a cut in the weighted hierarchical tree of
point segments, independently of semantic classification. Remarkably, this
unified approach leads to strong performance on both known and unknown classes.},

Abstract      = {Environment Sound Classification has been a well-studied research problem in
the field of signal processing and up till now more focus has been laid on
fully supervised approaches. Over the last few years, focus has moved towards
semi-supervised methods which concentrate on the utilization of unlabeled data,
and self-supervised methods which learn the intermediate representation through
pretext task or contrastive learning. However, both approaches require a vast
amount of unlabelled data to improve performance. In this work, we propose a
novel framework called Environmental Sound Classification with Hierarchical
Ontology-guided semi-supervised Learning (ECHO) that utilizes label
ontology-based hierarchy to learn semantic representation by defining a novel
pretext task. In the pretext task, the model tries to predict coarse labels
defined by the Large Language Model (LLM) based on ground truth label ontology.
The trained model is further fine-tuned in a supervised way to predict the
actual task. Our proposed novel semi-supervised framework achieves an accuracy
improvement in the range of 1\% to 8\% over baseline systems across three
datasets namely UrbanSound8K, ESC-10, and ESC-50.},

Abstract      = {Ontologies and knowledge graphs (KGs) are general-purpose computable
representations of some domain, such as human anatomy, and are frequently a
crucial part of modern information systems. Most of these structures change
over time, incorporating new knowledge or information that was previously
missing. Managing these changes is a challenge, both in terms of communicating
changes to users, and providing mechanisms to make it easier for multiple
stakeholders to contribute.
  To fill that need, we have created KGCL, the Knowledge Graph Change Language,
a standard data model for describing changes to KGs and ontologies at a high
level, and an accompanying human-readable controlled natural language. This
language serves two purposes: a curator can use it to request desired changes,
and it can also be used to describe changes that have already happened,
corresponding to the concepts of "apply patch" and "diff" commonly used for
managing changes in text documents and computer programs. Another key feature
of KGCL is that descriptions are at a high enough level to be useful and
understood by a variety of stakeholders--for example, ontology edits can be
specified by commands like "add synonym 'arm' to 'forelimb'" or "move
'Parkinson disease' under 'neurodegenerative disease'".
  We have also built a suite of tools for managing ontology changes. These
include an automated agent that integrates with and monitors GitHub ontology
repositories and applies any requested changes, and a new component in the
BioPortal ontology resource that allows users to make change requests directly
from within the BioPortal user interface.
  Overall, the KGCL data model, its controlled natural language, and associated
tooling allow for easier management and processing of changes associated with
the development of ontologies and KGs.},

LLMs suffer from 1) prompt sensitivity, 2) inability to model negation (e.g.
'rock song without guitar'), and 3) sensitivity towards the presence of
specific words. We quantified these properties as a triplet-based accuracy,
evaluating the ability to model the relative similarity of labels in a
hierarchical ontology. We leveraged the Audioset ontology to generate triplets
consisting of an anchor, a positive (relevant) label, and a negative (less
relevant) label for the genre and instruments sub-tree. We evaluated the
triplet-based musical knowledge for six general-purpose Transformer-based
models. The triplets obtained through this methodology required filtering, as
some were difficult to judge and therefore relatively uninformative for
evaluation purposes. Despite the relatively high accuracy reported,
inconsistencies are evident in all six models, suggesting that off-the-shelf
LLMs need adaptation to music before use.},

generation of CQs given a set of scientific papers considered to be a domain
knowledge base. We investigate its performance and specifically, we study the
impact of different number of papers to the RAG and different temperature
setting of the LLM. We conduct experiments using GPT-4 on two domain ontology
engineering tasks and compare results against ground-truth CQs constructed by
domain experts. Empirical assessments on the results, utilizing evaluation

prompting, adding relevant domain knowledge to the RAG improves the performance

Abstract      = {This study evaluates the ability of large language models (LLMs) to map
biomedical ontology terms to their corresponding ontology IDs across the Human
Phenotype Ontology (HPO), Gene Ontology (GO), and UniProtKB terminologies.
Using counts of ontology IDs in the PubMed Central (PMC) dataset as a surrogate
for their prevalence in the biomedical literature, we examined the relationship
between ontology ID prevalence and mapping accuracy. Results indicate that
ontology ID prevalence strongly predicts accurate mapping of HPO terms to HPO
IDs, GO terms to GO IDs, and protein names to UniProtKB accession numbers.
Higher prevalence of ontology IDs in the biomedical literature correlated with
higher mapping accuracy. Predictive models based on receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed this relationship.
  In contrast, this pattern did not apply to mapping protein names to Human
Genome Organisation's (HUGO) gene symbols. GPT-4 achieved a high baseline
performance (95%) in mapping protein names to HUGO gene symbols, with mapping
accuracy unaffected by prevalence. We propose that the high prevalence of HUGO
gene symbols in the literature has caused these symbols to become lexicalized,
enabling GPT-4 to map protein names to HUGO gene symbols with high accuracy.
These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in mapping ontology terms to
low-prevalence ontology IDs and underscore the importance of incorporating
ontology ID prevalence into the training and evaluation of LLMs for biomedical
applications.},

concept name length (in words), concept occurrence frequency in the medical
literature, and syntactic categories of component words. As an added factor, we
used the simplicity of a term after mapping it into a specific foreign

maximum agreement between the metric and three medical experts. The results

demonstrates it on a convergent system-of-systems. It uses the Systems Modeling
Language, model-based systems engineering and Hetero-Functional Graph Theory
(HFGT) to overcome the convergence research challenges when constructing models
and measures from multiple disciplines for systems resilience. The paper
includes both the ``survival" as well as ``recovery" components of resilience.
It also strikes a middle ground between two disparate approaches to resilience
measurement: structural measurement of formal graphs and detailed behavioral
simulation. This paper also generalizes a previous resilience measure based on
HFGT and benefits from recent theoretical and computational developments in
HFGT. To demonstrate the methodological developments, the resilience analysis
is conducted on a hypothetical energy-water nexus system of moderate size as a
type of system-of-systems.},

Abstract      = {We take supersymmetry in the Seiberg-Witten theory as a case study of the
uses of (super)symmetry arguments in studying the ontology of four-dimensional
interacting quantum field theories. Together with a double expansion,
supersymmetry is a via media that helps to bridge the gap between the
ontologies of an exact quantum field theory and its semi-classical limit. We
discuss a class of states that exist at any value of the coupling, and whose
properties such as mass, electric and magnetic charges, and spin quantum
numbers can be precisely characterised at low energies. The low-energy theory
is best presented as a one-dimensional complex manifold, equipped with metric
and other structures: namely, the space of low-energy vacua, covered by three
open regions that are interpreted as macroscopic phases. We discuss two cases
of emergence: the emergence of the low-energy regime and the emergence between
models at low energies, thereby highlighting the significance of the topology
of the space of vacua for such cases of emergence.},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.LG},
Abstract      = {Discovering individuals depression on social media has become increasingly
important. Researchers employed ML/DL or lexicon-based methods for automated
depression detection. Lexicon based methods, explainable and easy to implement,
match words from user posts in a depression dictionary without considering
contexts. While the DL models can leverage contextual information, their
black-box nature limits their adoption in the domain. Though surrogate models
like LIME and SHAP can produce explanations for DL models, the explanations are
suitable for the developer and of limited use to the end user. We propose a
Knolwedge-infused Neural Network (KiNN) incorporating domain-specific knowledge
from DepressionFeature ontology (DFO) in a neural network to endow the model
with user-level explainability regarding concepts and processes the clinician
understands. Further, commonsense knowledge from the Commonsense Transformer
(COMET) trained on ATOMIC is also infused to consider the generic emotional
aspects of user posts in depression detection. The model is evaluated on three
expertly curated datasets related to depression. We observed the model to have
a statistically significant (p<0.1) boost in performance over the best
domain-specific model, MentalBERT, across CLEF e-Risk (25% MCC increase, 12% F1
increase). A similar trend is observed across the PRIMATE dataset, where the
proposed model performed better than MentalBERT (2.5% MCC increase, 19% F1
increase). The observations confirm the generated explanations to be
informative for MHPs compared to post hoc model explanations. Results
demonstrated that the user-level explainability of KiNN also surpasses the
performance of baseline models and can provide explanations where other
baselines fall short. Infusing the domain and commonsense knowledge in KiNN
enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant
explanations.},

Abstract      = {Protein function prediction is a crucial task in bioinformatics, with
significant implications for understanding biological processes and disease
mechanisms. While the relationship between sequence and function has been
extensively explored, translating protein structure to function continues to
present substantial challenges. Various models, particularly, CNN and
graph-based deep learning approaches that integrate structural and functional
data, have been proposed to address these challenges. However, these methods
often fall short in elucidating the functional significance of key residues
essential for protein functionality, as they predominantly adopt a
retrospective perspective, leading to suboptimal performance.
  Inspired by region proposal networks in computer vision, we introduce the
Protein Region Proposal Network (ProteinRPN) for accurate protein function
prediction. Specifically, the region proposal module component of ProteinRPN
identifies potential functional regions (anchors) which are refined through the
hierarchy-aware node drop pooling layer favoring nodes with defined secondary
structures and spatial proximity. The representations of the predicted
functional nodes are enriched using attention mechanisms and subsequently fed
into a Graph Multiset Transformer, which is trained with supervised contrastive
(SupCon) and InfoNCE losses on perturbed protein structures. Our model
demonstrates significant improvements in predicting Gene Ontology (GO) terms,
effectively localizing functional residues within protein structures. The
proposed framework provides a robust, scalable solution for protein function
annotation, advancing the understanding of protein structure-function
relationships in computational biology.},

between cell types, which are available in cell ontology graphs. We argue that
effectively leveraging this ontology information during the TFM pre-training

preserving TFM as a general purpose foundation model for downstream zero-shot

alignment loss, which are minimized along with the masked gene expression
prediction loss during the pre-training. The novel loss component guide scCello

between cell types from the cell ontology graph, respectively. We pre-trained
scCello on 22 million cells from CellxGene database leveraging their cell-type
labels mapped to the cell ontology graph from Open Biological and Biomedical

interaction with the LLM is grounded in a simple ontology with 4 types of
entities and 7 types of relations. To evaluate our architecture, we use a gold
standard graph constructed using a small subset of the documents, and compare
this to the graph obtained from our approach when processing the same set of
documents. Results show that the automatic construction manages to recognize a
good portion of all the entities in the gold standard, and that those not
recognized are mostly explained by the level of granularity in which the
information is structured in the graph, and not because the automatic approach
misses an important entity in the graph. Looking forward, we expect this report
will encourage work on other similar projects focused on enhancing research in
humanities and social science, but we remark that better evaluation metrics are

the LLM-Duo system features two specialized LLM agents, an explorer and an

Experimental results show that our approach surpasses advanced baselines,

Eprint        = {2408.10053v2},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Privacy research has attracted wide attention as individuals worry that their
private data can be easily leaked during interactions with smart devices,
social platforms, and AI applications. Computer science researchers, on the
other hand, commonly study privacy issues through privacy attacks and defenses
on segmented fields. Privacy research is conducted on various sub-fields,
including Computer Vision (CV), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer
Networks. Within each field, privacy has its own formulation. Though pioneering
works on attacks and defenses reveal sensitive privacy issues, they are
narrowly trapped and cannot fully cover people's actual privacy concerns.
Consequently, the research on general and human-centric privacy research
remains rather unexplored. In this paper, we formulate the privacy issue as a
reasoning problem rather than simple pattern matching. We ground on the
Contextual Integrity (CI) theory which posits that people's perceptions of
privacy are highly correlated with the corresponding social context. Based on
such an assumption, we develop the first comprehensive checklist that covers
social identities, private attributes, and existing privacy regulations. Unlike
prior works on CI that either cover limited expert annotated norms or model
incomplete social context, our proposed privacy checklist uses the whole Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) as an example, to
show that we can resort to large language models (LLMs) to completely cover the
HIPAA's regulations. Additionally, our checklist also gathers expert

Abstract      = {Mathematical models and algorithms are an essential part of mathematical
research data, as they are epistemically grounding numerical data. In order to
represent models and algorithms as well as their relationship semantically to
make this research data FAIR, two previously distinct ontologies were merged
and extended, becoming a living knowledge graph. The link between the two
ontologies is established by introducing computational tasks, as they occur in
modeling, corresponding to algorithmic tasks. Moreover, controlled vocabularies
are incorporated and a new class, distinguishing base quantities from specific
use case quantities, was introduced. Also, both models and algorithms can now
be enriched with metadata. Subject-specific metadata is particularly relevant
here, such as the symmetry of a matrix or the linearity of a mathematical
model. This is the only way to express specific workflows with concrete models
and algorithms, as the feasible solution algorithm can only be determined if
the mathematical properties of a model are known. We demonstrate this using two
examples from different application areas of applied mathematics. In addition,
we have already integrated over 250 research assets from applied mathematics
into our knowledge graph.},

Abstract      = {Simulations offer opportunities in the examination of manufacturing
processes. They represent various aspects of the production process and the
associated production systems. However, often a single simulation does not
suffice to provide a comprehensive understanding of specific process settings.
Instead, a combination of different simulations is necessary when the outputs
of one simulation serve as the input parameters for another, resulting in a
sequence of simulations. Manual planning of simulation sequences is a demanding
task that requires careful evaluation of factors like time, cost, and result
quality to choose the best simulation scenario for a given inquiry. In this
paper, an information model is introduced, which represents simulations, their
capabilities to generate certain knowledge, and their respective quality
criteria. The information model is designed to provide the foundation for
automatically generating simulation sequences. The model is implemented as an
extendable and adaptable ontology. It utilizes Ontology Design Patterns based
on established industrial standards to enhance interoperability and
reusability. To demonstrate the practicality of this information model, an
application example is provided. This example serves to illustrate the model's
capacity in a real-world context, thereby validating its utility and potential
for future applications.},

present a black-box algorithm that supports the full expressive power of OWL
DL. This goes beyond what existing approaches combining automated planning with
ontologies can do, which only support limited description logics such as
DL-Lite and description logics that are Horn. Our main algorithm relies on
rewritings of the ontology-mediated planning specifications into PDDL, so that
existing planning systems can be used to solve them. The algorithm relies on
justifications, which allows for a generic approach that is independent of the
expressivity of the ontology language. However, dedicated optimizations for
computing justifications need to be implemented to enable an efficient
rewriting procedure. We evaluated our implementation on benchmark sets from
several domains. The evaluation shows that our procedure works in practice and
that tailoring the reasoning procedure has significant impact on the
performance.},

anchoring a model's behavior within these contexts. Our approach leverages
techniques from knowledge representation and reasoning, such as ontologies,
semantic web technologies, and logic-based formalisms. We evaluate our
framework on real-world textual datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in
improving model performance, fairness, and alignment with human expectations,
while maintaining high accuracy. Furthermore, we discuss the other key
components of the framework, including context-aware encoding, context-aware
learning, interpretability and explainability, and continuous monitoring and
adaptation. This research contributes to the growing body of work on

threshold. By constraining the decoding to ontology terms and relations, we aim
to decrease the risk of hallucination. We conduct extensive experimentation on

fine-tuning an object detection model YOLO-FF, and implementing a custom

domain knowledge in data preparation, model development and reasoning. We
implement several anomaly detection models on the derived image dataset,
including a Convolutional Neural Network, Vision Transformer (ViT), and
pre-trained versions of these models. Additionally, we incorporate
explainability techniques at both user and model levels, utilizing ontology for
user-level explanations and SCORE-CAM for in-depth feature and model analysis.
Finally, the best-performing anomaly detection model and YOLO-FF are deployed
in a real-time setting. Our results include ablation studies on the baselines
and a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed system. This work highlights the

  Forensic tool innovations and ontology developments, such as the Unified

identifying, categorizing, and normalizing signs, achieving concordance with
manual annotators comparable to inter-rater agreement. Despite some limitations
in sign normalization, the extensive pre-training of GPT-4 results in high
performance and generalizability across several phenotyping tasks while
obviating the need for manually annotated training data. Large language models
are expected to be the dominant method for automating high-throughput

Abstract      = {It has been reliably shown that the similarity of word embeddings obtained
from popular neural models such as BERT approximates effectively a form of
semantic similarity of the meaning of those words. It is therefore natural to
wonder if those embeddings contain enough information to be able to connect
those meanings through ontological relationships such as the one of
subsumption. If so, large knowledge models could be built that are capable of
semantically relating terms based on the information encapsulated in word
embeddings produced by pre-trained models, with implications not only for
ontologies (ontology matching, ontology evolution, etc.) but also on the
ability to integrate ontological knowledge in neural models. In this paper, we
test how embeddings produced by several pre-trained models can be used to
predict relations existing between classes and properties of popular
upper-level and general ontologies. We show that even a simple feed-forward
architecture on top of those embeddings can achieve promising accuracies, with
varying generalisation abilities depending on the input data. To achieve that,
we produce a dataset that can be used to further enhance those models, opening
new possibilities for applications integrating knowledge from web ontologies.},

properties. However, it covers only a small fraction of the rapidly growing
knowledge in chemistry and does not provide references to the scientific
literature. To address this, we propose a methodology that involves augmenting
existing annotated text corpora with knowledge from Chebi and fine-tuning a
large language model (LLM) to recognize chemical entities and their roles in
scientific text. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
By combining ontological knowledge and the language understanding capabilities
of LLMs, we achieve high precision and recall rates in identifying both the
chemical entities and roles in scientific literature. Furthermore, we extract
them from a set of 8,000 ChemRxiv articles, and apply a second LLM to create a
knowledge graph (KG) of chemical entities and roles (CEAR), which provides
complementary information to ChEBI, and can help to extend it.},

comprehensive knowledge coverage and dynamic updates of the Ontology schema and
instances. To ensure compactness, we utilize cross-layer filtering methods for
knowledge condensation in KGs. Our approach, named PolyRAG, follows a waterfall
model for retrieval, starting from the top of the pyramid and progressing down
until a confident answer is obtained. We introduce two benchmarks for
domain-specific knowledge retrieval, one in the academic domain and the other
in the financial domain. The effectiveness of the methods has been validated
through comprehensive experiments by outperforming 19 SOTA methods. An
encouraging observation is that the proposed method has augmented the GPT-4,

modelling. The Rosetta Statement approach proposes modeling English natural
language statements instead of a mind-independent reality. We propose a
metamodel for creating semantic schema patterns for simple statement types. The
approach supports versioning of statements and provides a detailed editing
history. Each Rosetta Statement pattern has a dynamic label for displaying
statements as natural language sentences. Implemented in the Open Research
Knowledge Graph (ORKG) as a use case, this approach allows domain experts to
define data schema patterns without needing semantic knowledge. Future plans
include combining Rosetta Statements with semantic units to organize ORKG into
meaningful subgraphs, improving usability. A search interface for querying
statements without needing SPARQL or Cypher knowledge is also planned, along
with tools for data entry and display using Large Language Models. The Rosetta
Statement metamodel supports a three-step knowledge graph construction
procedure. Domain experts can model semantic content without support from
ontology engineers by using Wikidata, lowering entry barriers and increasing
cognitive interoperability. The second level involves mapping Wikidata terms to
established ontologies, and the third step developing semantic graph patterns

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated unprecedented prowess across
various natural language processing tasks in various application domains.
Recent studies show that LLMs can be leveraged to perform lexical semantic
tasks, such as Knowledge Base Completion (KBC) or Ontology Learning (OL).
However, it has not effectively been verified whether their success is due to
their ability to reason over unstructured or semi-structured data, or their
effective learning of linguistic patterns and senses alone. This unresolved
question is particularly crucial when dealing with domain-specific data, where
the lexical senses and their meaning can completely differ from what a LLM has
learned during its training stage. This paper investigates the following
question: Do LLMs really adapt to domains and remain consistent in the
extraction of structured knowledge, or do they only learn lexical senses
instead of reasoning? To answer this question and, we devise a controlled
experiment setup that uses WordNet to synthesize parallel corpora, with English
and gibberish terms. We examine the differences in the outputs of LLMs for each
corpus in two OL tasks: relation extraction and taxonomy discovery. Empirical
results show that, while adapting to the gibberish corpora, off-the-shelf LLMs
do not consistently reason over semantic relationships between concepts, and
instead leverage senses and their frame. However, fine-tuning improves the
performance of LLMs on lexical semantic tasks even when the domain-specific
terms are arbitrary and unseen during pre-training, hinting at the
applicability of pre-trained LLMs for OL.},

finds that, where the classical system always obeys the rule "probability in =

Abstract      = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI), exemplified by the release of

ontologies extending from established upper-level frameworks like the Basic
Formal Ontology (BFO), risking the creation of non-integrable ontology silos.
This study explores the extent to which LLMs, particularly GPT-4, can support
ontologists trained in BFO. Through iterative development of a specialized GPT
model named "My Ontologist," we aimed to generate BFO-conformant ontologies.
Initial versions faced challenges in maintaining definition conventions and

Abstract      = {As the number of scientific publications and preprints is growing
exponentially, several attempts have been made to navigate this complex and
increasingly detailed landscape. These have almost exclusively taken
unsupervised approaches that fail to incorporate domain knowledge and lack the
structural organisation required for intuitive interactive human exploration
and discovery. Especially in highly interdisciplinary fields, a deep
understanding of the connectedness of research works across topics is essential
for generating insights. We have developed a unique approach to data navigation
that leans on geographical visualisation and uses hierarchically structured
domain knowledge to enable end-users to explore knowledge spaces grounded in
their desired domains of interest. This can take advantage of existing
ontologies, proprietary intelligence schemata, or be directly derived from the
underlying data through hierarchical topic modelling. Our approach uses natural
language processing techniques to extract named entities from the underlying
data and normalise them against relevant domain references and navigational
structures. The knowledge is integrated by first calculating similarities
between entities based on their shared extracted feature space and then by
alignment to the navigational structures. The result is a knowledge graph that
allows for full text and semantic graph query and structured topic driven
navigation. This allows end-users to identify entities relevant to their needs
and access extensive graph analytics. The user interface facilitates graphical
interaction with the underlying knowledge graph and mimics a cartographic map
to maximise ease of use and widen adoption. We demonstrate an exemplar project
using our generalisable and scalable infrastructure for an academic biomedical
literature corpus that is grounded against hundreds of different named domain
entities.},

Abstract      = {Extensive research in the field of ontology-based query answering has led to
the identification of numerous fragments of existential rules (also known as
tuple-generating dependencies) that exhibit decidable answering of atomic and
conjunctive queries. Motivated by the increased theoretical and practical
interest in navigational queries, this paper considers the question for which
of these fragments decidability of querying extends to regular path queries
(RPQs). In fact, decidability of RPQs has recently been shown to generally hold
for the comprehensive family of all fragments that come with the guarantee of
universal models being reasonably well-shaped (that is, being of finite
cliquewidth). Yet, for the second major family of fragments, known as finite
unification sets (short: fus), which are based on first-order-rewritability,
corresponding results have been largely elusive so far. We complete the picture
by showing that RPQ answering over arbitrary fus rulesets is undecidable. On
the positive side, we establish that the problem is decidable for the prominent
fus subclass of sticky rulesets, with the caveat that a very mild extension of
the RPQ formalism turns the problem undecidable again.},

Abstract      = {As mobile applications become increasingly integral to our daily lives,
concerns about ethics have grown drastically. Users share their experiences,

machine learning techniques have been used in the past to identify these
ethical concerns. However, understanding the underlying reasons behind them and
extracting requirements that could address these concerns is crucial for safer
software solution development. Thus, we propose a novel approach that leverages
a knowledge graph (KG) model to extract software requirements from app reviews,
capturing contextual data related to ethical concerns. Our framework consists
of three main components: developing an ontology with relevant entities and
relations, extracting key entities from app reviews, and creating connections
between them. This study analyzes app reviews of the Uber mobile application (a
popular taxi/ride app) and presents the preliminary results from the proposed
solution. Initial results show that KG can effectively capture contextual data
related to software ethical concerns, the underlying reasons behind these
concerns, and the corresponding potential requirements.},

Abstract      = {We apply an approach from cognitive linguistics by mapping Conceptual
Metaphor Theory (CMT) to the visualization domain to address patterns of visual
conceptual metaphors that are often used in science infographics. Metaphors
play an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to
explain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition,
rather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language
for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent
where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g.,
infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within
scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in
existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this
mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains
(biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range
of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science.
This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use
within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors
are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in
scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational
conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex
scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory
tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on
a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual
metaphors.},

intent. The outputs of these base models are aggregated through a feedforward

To enhance interpretability, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is employed
to analyze token-level contributions, and interactions among base models,
providing transparency into the classification dynamics of CiteFusion, and
insights about the kind of misclassifications of the ensem-ble. In addition,
this work investigates the semantic role of structural context by incorporating

Abstract      = {This paper investigates the ontological characterization of Large Language
Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT. Between inflationary and deflationary accounts, we
pay special attention to their status as agents. This requires explaining in
detail the architecture, processing, and training procedures that enable LLMs
to display their capacities, and the extensions used to turn LLMs into
agent-like systems. After a systematic analysis we conclude that a LLM fails to
meet necessary and sufficient conditions for autonomous agency in the light of
embodied theories of mind: the individuality condition (it is not the product
of its own activity, it is not even directly affected by it), the normativity
condition (it does not generate its own norms or goals), and, partially the
interactional asymmetry condition (it is not the origin and sustained source of
its interaction with the environment). If not agents, then ... what are LLMs?
We argue that ChatGPT should be characterized as an interlocutor or linguistic
automaton, a library-that-talks, devoid of (autonomous) agency, but capable to
engage performatively on non-purposeful yet purpose-structured and
purpose-bounded tasks. When interacting with humans, a "ghostly" component of
the human-machine interaction makes it possible to enact genuine conversational
experiences with LLMs. Despite their lack of sensorimotor and biological
embodiment, LLMs textual embodiment (the training corpus) and resource-hungry
computational embodiment, significantly transform existing forms of human
agency. Beyond assisted and extended agency, the LLM-human coupling can produce
midtended forms of agency, closer to the production of intentional agency than
to the extended instrumentality of any previous technologies.},

the form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more
parameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to
a $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a
cone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a
transformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE
can learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond
one to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical
study on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results
over previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset,
AConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide
comprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms
positively impacts the results of query answering.},

Abstract      = {Information extraction from handwritten documents involves traditionally

these steps into a single process using fully end-to-end architectures. Despite

language models, when applied to information extraction in plain text. In this
paper, we introduce DANIEL (Document Attention Network for Information
Extraction and Labelling), a fully end-to-end architecture integrating a
language model and designed for comprehensive handwritten document
understanding. DANIEL performs layout recognition, handwriting recognition, and
named entity recognition on full-page documents. Moreover, it can
simultaneously learn across multiple languages, layouts, and tasks. For named
entity recognition, the ontology to be applied can be specified via the input
prompt. The architecture employs a convolutional encoder capable of processing
images of any size without resizing, paired with an autoregressive decoder
based on a transformer-based language model. DANIEL achieves competitive
results on four datasets, including a new state-of-the-art performance on RIMES
2009 and M-POPP for Handwriting Text Recognition, and IAM NER for Named Entity
Recognition. Furthermore, DANIEL is much faster than existing approaches.

Abstract      = {Continual learning (CL) addresses the problem of catastrophic forgetting in

learned. Current CL problems involve either learning new domains
(domain-incremental) or new and previously unseen classes (class-incremental).
However, general learning processes are not just limited to learning
information, but also refinement of existing information. In this paper, we
define CLEO - Continual Learning of Evolving Ontologies, as a new incremental
learning setting under CL to tackle evolving classes. CLEO is motivated by the
need for intelligent systems to adapt to real-world ontologies that change over
time, such as those in autonomous driving. We use Cityscapes, PASCAL VOC, and
Mapillary Vistas to define the task settings and demonstrate the applicability
of CLEO. We highlight the shortcomings of existing CIL methods in adapting to
CLEO and propose a baseline solution, called Modelling Ontologies (MoOn). CLEO
is a promising new approach to CL that addresses the challenge of evolving

in the fields of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM). Objective: This study
aimed to construct an Integrated Ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO) to
support the data mining of Chinese EMRs and real-world study in TCM field.
Methods: To construct an integrated ontology of symptom phenotypes (ISPO), we
manually annotated classical TCM textbooks and large-scale Chinese electronic
medical records (EMRs) to collect symptom terms with support from a medical
text annotation system. Furthermore, to facilitate the semantic
interoperability between different terminologies, we incorporated public
available biomedical vocabularies by manual mapping between Chinese terms and
English terms with cross-references to source vocabularies. In addition, we
evaluated the ISPO using independent clinical EMRs to provide a high-usable
medical ontology for clinical data analysis. Results: By integrating 78,696
inpatient cases of EMRs, 5 biomedical vocabularies, 21 TCM books and
dictionaries, ISPO provides 3,147 concepts, 23,475 terms, and 55,552 definition
or contextual texts. Adhering to the taxonomical structure of the related
anatomical systems of symptom phenotypes, ISPO provides 12 top-level categories
and 79 middle-level sub-categories. The validation of data analysis showed the
ISPO has a coverage rate of 95.35%, 98.53% and 92.66% for symptom terms with
occurrence rates of 0.5% in additional three independent curated clinical
datasets, which can demonstrate the significant value of ISPO in mapping
clinical terms to ontologies.},

automation systems. The proposed information model for artificial intelligence

various aspects of automation systems and AI software. Validated through a

queries and test oracles (metamorphic or ontological oracle). KonTest further
mitigates knowledge gaps via a weighted LLM model ensemble. Using four
state-of-the-art LLMs (Falcon, Gemini, GPT3.5, and Llama2), we show that
KonTest generates 19.2% error inducing inputs (1917 errors from 9979 test
inputs). It also reveals a 16.5% knowledge gap across all tested LLMs. A
mitigation method informed by KonTest's test suite reduces LLM knowledge gap by
32.48%. Our ablation study further shows that GPT3.5 is not suitable for
knowledge-based consistency testing because it is only 60%-68% effective in
knowledge construction.},

Masked Language Modeling (MLM), MLM with full-word masking, and MLM with
targeted masking, to analyse their effectiveness in learning and integrating
the extracted graph data. Through empirical evaluation on language-specific

Abstract      = {The majority of Neural Semantic Parsing (NSP) models are developed with the
assumption that there are no concepts outside the ones such models can
represent with their target symbols (closed-world assumption). This assumption
leads to generate hallucinated outputs rather than admitting their lack of
knowledge. Hallucinations can lead to wrong or potentially offensive responses
to users. Hence, a mechanism to prevent this behavior is crucial to build
trusted NSP-based Question Answering agents. To that end, we propose the
Hallucination Simulation Framework (HSF), a general setting for stimulating and
analyzing NSP model hallucinations. The framework can be applied to any NSP
task with a closed-ontology. Using the proposed framework and KQA Pro as the
benchmark dataset, we assess state-of-the-art techniques for hallucination
detection. We then present a novel hallucination detection strategy that
exploits the computational graph of the NSP model to detect the NSP
hallucinations in the presence of ontology gaps, out-of-domain utterances, and
to recognize NSP errors, improving the F1-Score respectively by ~21, ~24% and
~1%. This is the first work in closed-ontology NSP that addresses the problem

models used in safety-critical domains by ensuring the robustness and
completeness of the model's training dataset. Because ML models embody what
they are trained with, ensuring the completeness of training datasets can help
to increase the trust in the training of ML models. To this end, this paper
proposes the use of a domain ontology and an image quality characteristic
ontology to validate the domain completeness and image quality robustness of a

Abstract      = {This study introduces a novel knowledge enhanced tokenisation mechanism,

stage, K-Tokeniser populates global representations of tokens based on semantic
types of domain concepts (such as drugs or diseases) from either a domain
ontology like Unified Medical Language System or the training data of the task
related corpus. At training or inference stage, sentence level localised
context will be utilised for choosing the optimal global token representation
to realise the semantic-based tokenisation. To avoid pretraining using the new
tokeniser, an embedding initialisation approach is proposed to generate
representations for new tokens. Using three transformer-based language models,
a comprehensive set of experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets
for evaluating K-Tokeniser in a wide range of clinical text analytics tasks
including clinical concept and relation extraction, automated clinical coding,
clinical phenotype identification, and clinical research article
classification. Overall, our models demonstrate consistent improvements over
their counterparts in all tasks. In particular, substantial improvements are
observed in the automated clinical coding task with 13\% increase on Micro
$F_1$ score. Furthermore, K-Tokeniser also shows significant capacities in
facilitating quicker converge of language models. Specifically, using
K-Tokeniser, the language models would only require 50\% of the training data
to achieve the best performance of the baseline tokeniser using all training
data in the concept extraction task and less than 20\% of the data for the
automated coding task. It is worth mentioning that all these improvements
require no pre-training process, making the approach generalisable.},

Abstract      = {The search engine process is crucial for document content retrieval. For
Khmer documents, an effective tool is needed to extract essential keywords and
facilitate accurate searches. Despite the daily generation of significant Khmer
content, Cambodians struggle to find necessary documents due to the lack of an
effective semantic searching tool. Even Google does not deliver high accuracy
for Khmer content. Semantic search engines improve search results by employing
advanced algorithms to understand various content types. With the rise in Khmer
digital content such as reports, articles, and social media feedback enhanced
search capabilities are essential. This research proposes the first Khmer
Semantic Search Engine (KSE), designed to enhance traditional Khmer search
methods. Utilizing semantic matching techniques and formally annotated semantic
content, our tool extracts meaningful keywords from user queries, performs
precise matching, and provides the best matching offline documents and online
URLs. We propose three semantic search frameworks: semantic search based on a
keyword dictionary, semantic search based on ontology, and semantic search
based on ranking. Additionally, we developed tools for data preparation,
including document addition and manual keyword extraction. To evaluate
performance, we created a ground truth dataset and addressed issues related to
searching and semantic search. Our findings demonstrate that understanding
search term semantics can lead to significantly more accurate results.},

Abstract      = {The first step towards digitalization within organizations lies in
digitization - the conversion of analog data into digitally stored data. This
basic step is the prerequisite for all following activities like the
digitalization of processes or the servitization of products or offerings.
However, digitization itself often leads to 'data-rich' but 'knowledge-poor'
material. Knowledge discovery and knowledge extraction as approaches try to
increase the usefulness of digitized data. In this paper, we point out the key
challenges in the context of knowledge discovery and present an approach to
addressing these using a microservices architecture. Our solution led to a
conceptual design focusing on keyword extraction, similarity calculation of
documents, database queries in natural language, and programming language
independent provision of the extracted information. In addition, the conceptual
design provides referential design guidelines for integrating processes and
applications for semi-automatic learning, editing, and visualization of
ontologies. The concept also uses a microservices architecture to address
non-functional requirements, such as scalability and resilience. The evaluation
of the specified requirements is performed using a demonstrator that implements
the concept. Furthermore, this modern approach is used in the German patent
office in an extended version.},

a predefined prompt using a few-shot prompting technique. After prompting an
LLM, the resulting capability ontology is automatically verified through
various steps in a loop with the LLM to check the overall correctness of the
capability ontology. First, a syntax check is performed, then a check for
contradictions, and finally a check for hallucinations and missing ontology
elements. Our method greatly reduces manual effort, as only the initial natural
language description and a final human review and possible correction are
necessary, thereby streamlining the capability ontology generation process.},

Abstract      = {Understanding commonsense knowledge is crucial in the field of Natural
Language Processing (NLP). However, the presence of demographic terms in
commonsense knowledge poses a potential risk of compromising the performance of
NLP models. This study aims to investigate and propose methods for enhancing
the performance and effectiveness of a commonsense polarization classifier by
mitigating the influence of demographic terms. Three methods are introduced in
this paper: (1) hierarchical generalization of demographic terms (2)
threshold-based augmentation and (3) integration of hierarchical generalization
and threshold-based augmentation methods (IHTA). The first method involves
replacing demographic terms with more general ones based on a term hierarchy
ontology, aiming to mitigate the influence of specific terms. To address the
limited bias-related information, the second method measures the polarization
of demographic terms by comparing the changes in the model's predictions when
these terms are masked versus unmasked. This method augments commonsense
sentences containing terms with high polarization values by replacing their
predicates with synonyms generated by ChatGPT. The third method combines the
two approaches, starting with threshold-based augmentation followed by
hierarchical generalization. The experiments show that the first method
increases the accuracy over the baseline by 2.33%, and the second one by 0.96%
over standard augmentation methods. The IHTA techniques yielded an 8.82% and
9.96% higher accuracy than threshold-based and standard augmentation methods,

and updating the current solution state. We identify a thorough ontology of
actions for addressing complex tasks and curate high-quality data to train
expert models for executing these actions. Our experiments show that Husky
outperforms prior language agents across 14 evaluation datasets. Moreover, we
introduce HuskyQA, a new evaluation set which stress tests language agents for
mixed-tool reasoning, with a focus on retrieving missing knowledge and
performing numerical reasoning. Despite using 7B models, Husky matches or even

Abstract      = {In the contemporary world of AI and data-driven applications, supervised
machines often derive their understanding, which they mimic and reproduce,
through annotations--typically conveyed in the form of words or labels.
However, such annotations are often divorced from or lack contextual
information, and as such hold the potential to inadvertently introduce biases
when subsequently used for training. This paper introduces SituAnnotate, a
novel ontology explicitly crafted for 'situated grounding,' aiming to anchor
the ground truth data employed in training AI systems within the contextual and
culturally-bound situations from which those ground truths emerge. SituAnnotate
offers an ontology-based approach to structured and context-aware data
annotation, addressing potential bias issues associated with isolated
annotations. Its representational power encompasses situational context,
including annotator details, timing, location, remuneration schemes, annotation
roles, and more, ensuring semantic richness. Aligned with the foundational
Dolce Ultralight ontology, it provides a robust and consistent framework for
knowledge representation. As a method to create, query, and compare label-based
datasets, SituAnnotate empowers downstream AI systems to undergo training with
explicit consideration of context and cultural bias, laying the groundwork for
enhanced system interpretability and adaptability, and enabling AI models to
align with a multitude of cultural contexts and viewpoints.},

from the other tier, which has access to trained models from machine learning
algorithms. To analyse this hypothesis, I create two experiments based on
different datasets, which are related directly to risk-awareness of autonomous
systems, analysed by different machine learning algorithms (namely; multi-layer
feedforward backpropagation, Naive Bayes, and J48 decision tree). My analysis
shows that the two-tiers intelligence approach for coupling ML and KB is

acquire about language will always be buried in millions of weights none of

Abstract      = {Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) is crucial for understanding sentiment
nuances in text, especially across diverse languages and cultures. This paper
introduces a novel Deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based model tailored
for aspect and polarity classification in Hausa movie reviews, an
underrepresented language in sentiment analysis research. A comprehensive Hausa
ABSA dataset is created, filling a significant gap in resource availability.
The dataset, preprocessed using sci-kit-learn for TF-IDF transformation,
includes manually annotated aspect-level feature ontology words and sentiment
polarity assignments. The proposed model combines CNNs with attention
mechanisms for aspect-word prediction, leveraging contextual information and
sentiment polarities. With 91% accuracy on aspect term extraction and 92% on
sentiment polarity classification, the model outperforms traditional machine
models, offering insights into specific aspects and sentiments. This study
advances ABSA research, particularly in underrepresented languages, with
implications for cross-cultural linguistic research.},

Abstract      = {The incorporation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) models into various
optimization systems is on the rise. Yet, addressing complex urban and
environmental management problems normally requires in-depth domain science and
informatics expertise. This expertise is essential for deriving data and
simulation-driven for informed decision support. In this context, we
investigate the potential of leveraging the pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs). By adopting ChatGPT API as the reasoning core, we outline an integrated
workflow that encompasses natural language processing, methontology-based
prompt tuning, and transformers. This workflow automates the creation of
scenario-based ontology using existing research articles and technical manuals
of urban datasets and simulations. The outcomes of our methodology are
knowledge graphs in widely adopted ontology languages (e.g., OWL, RDF, SPARQL).
These facilitate the development of urban decision support systems by enhancing
the data and metadata modeling, the integration of complex datasets, the
coupling of multi-domain simulation models, and the formulation of
decision-making metrics and workflow. The feasibility of our methodology is
evaluated through a comparative analysis that juxtaposes our AI-generated
ontology with the well-known Pizza Ontology employed in tutorials for popular
ontology software (e.g., prot\'eg\'e). We close with a real-world case study of
optimizing the complex urban system of multi-modal freight transportation by
generating anthologies of various domain data and simulations to support
informed decision-making.},

Abstract      = {Despite the many advantages that ontology-based data access (OBDA) has

Algorithms for query rewriting focus on languages like conjunctive queries and
their unions, which are fragments of first-order logic and were developed for
relational data. Such query languages are poorly suited for querying graph
data. Moreover, they also limit the expressiveness of the ontology languages
that admit rewritings, restricting them to those where the data complexity of
reasoning is not higher than it is in first-order logic. In this paper, we
propose a technique for rewriting a family of navigational queries for a
suitably restricted fragment of ELHI that extends DL-Lite and that is
NL-complete in data complexity. We implemented a proof-of-concept prototype
that rewrites into Cypher queries, and tested it on a real-world cognitive

Abstract      = {Machine learning (ML) methods are having a huge impact across all of the
sciences. However, ML has a strong ontology - in which only the data exist -
and a strong epistemology - in which a model is considered good if it performs
well on held-out training data. These philosophies are in strong conflict with
both standard practices and key philosophies in the natural sciences. Here we
identify some locations for ML in the natural sciences at which the ontology
and epistemology are valuable. For example, when an expressive machine learning
model is used in a causal inference to represent the effects of confounders,
such as foregrounds, backgrounds, or instrument calibration parameters, the
model capacity and loose philosophy of ML can make the results more
trustworthy. We also show that there are contexts in which the introduction of
ML introduces strong, unwanted statistical biases. For one, when ML models are
used to emulate physical (or first-principles) simulations, they amplify
confirmation biases. For another, when expressive regressions are used to label
datasets, those labels cannot be used in downstream joint or ensemble analyses
without taking on uncontrolled biases. The question in the title is being asked
of all of the natural sciences; that is, we are calling on the scientific
communities to take a step back and consider the role and value of ML in their
fields; the (partial) answers we give here come from the particular perspective
of physics.},

OntoDeM enriches agents' domain knowledge, allowing them to interpret
unforeseen events, generate or adapt goals, and make better decisions. Key
contributions include: 1. An ontology-based method to improve agents' real-time
observations using prior knowledge. 2. The OntoDeM model for handling dynamic,

Abstract      = {Organizational decision-making is crucial for success, yet cognitive biases
can significantly affect risk preferences, leading to suboptimal outcomes. Risk
seeking preferences for losses, driven by biases such as loss aversion, pose
challenges and can result in severe negative consequences, including financial
losses. This research introduces the ABI approach, a novel solution designed to
support organizational decision-makers by automatically identifying and
explaining risk seeking preferences during decision-making. This research makes
a novel contribution by automating the identification and explanation of risk
seeking preferences using Cumulative Prospect theory (CPT) from Behavioral
Economics. The ABI approach transforms theoretical insights into actionable,
real-time guidance, making them accessible to a broader range of organizations
and decision-makers without requiring specialized personnel. By contextualizing
CPT concepts into business language, the approach facilitates widespread
adoption and enhances decision-making processes with deep behavioral insights.
Our systematic literature review identified significant gaps in existing
methods, especially the lack of automated solutions with a concrete mechanism
for automatically identifying risk seeking preferences, and the absence of
formal knowledge representation, such as ontologies, for identifying and
explaining the risk preferences. The ABI Approach addresses these gaps,
offering a significant contribution to decision-making research and practice.
Furthermore, it enables automatic collection of historical decision data with
risk preferences, providing valuable insights for enhancing strategic
management and long-term organizational performance. An experiment provided
preliminary evidence on its effectiveness in helping decision-makers recognize
their risk seeking preferences during decision-making in the loss domain.},

segmentation, detection, and recognition for 82 object types across 9 imaging
modalities. Through joint learning, we can improve accuracy for individual
tasks and enable novel applications such as segmenting all relevant objects in
an image through a text prompt, rather than requiring users to laboriously
specify the bounding box for each object. We leveraged readily available
natural-language labels or descriptions accompanying those datasets and use
GPT-4 to harmonize the noisy, unstructured text information with established
biomedical object ontologies. We created a large dataset comprising over six
million triples of image, segmentation mask, and textual description. On image
segmentation, we showed that BiomedParse is broadly applicable, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods on 102,855 test image-mask-label triples across 9
imaging modalities (everything). On object detection, which aims to locate a
specific object of interest, BiomedParse again attained state-of-the-art
performance, especially on objects with irregular shapes (everywhere). On
object recognition, which aims to identify all objects in a given image along
with their semantic types, we showed that BiomedParse can simultaneously
segment and label all biomedical objects in an image (all at once). In summary,
BiomedParse is an all-in-one tool for biomedical image analysis by jointly
solving segmentation, detection, and recognition for all major biomedical image
modalities, paving the path for efficient and accurate image-based biomedical

Abstract      = {Drought is a complex environmental phenomenon that affects millions of people
and communities all over the globe and is too elusive to be accurately
predicted. This is mostly due to the scalability and variability of the web of
environmental parameters that directly/indirectly causes the onset of different
categories of drought. Since the dawn of man, efforts have been made to
uniquely understand the natural indicators that provide signs of likely
environmental events. These indicators/signs in the form of indigenous
knowledge system have been used for generations. The intricate complexity of
drought has, however, always been a major stumbling block for accurate drought
prediction and forecasting systems. Recently, scientists in the field of
agriculture and environmental monitoring have been discussing the integration
of indigenous knowledge and scientific knowledge for a more accurate
environmental forecasting system in order to incorporate diverse environmental
information for a reliable drought forecast. Hence, in this research, the core
objective is the development of a semantics-based data integration middleware
that encompasses and integrates heterogeneous data models of local indigenous
knowledge and sensor data towards an accurate drought forecasting system for
the study areas. The local indigenous knowledge on drought gathered from the
domain experts is transformed into rules to be used for performing deductive
inference in conjunction with sensors data for determining the onset of drought
through an automated inference generation module of the middleware. The
semantic middleware incorporates, inter alia, a distributed architecture that
consists of a streaming data processing engine based on Apache Kafka for
real-time stream processing; a rule-based reasoning module; an ontology module
for semantic representation of the knowledge bases.},

the approach uncovers a significant number of potential rare disease cases not

multiple data sources, as well as implementing AI-aware data management, can
have long-lasting, positive, and accelerating effects along with collecting and
utilizing quality data from different sources and across the entire data
lifecycle. The integration of ontologies in life cycle assessments has garnered
significant attention in recent years. We synthesized the existing literature
on ontologies for LCAs, providing insights into this interdisciplinary field's
evolution, current state, and future directions. We also proposed the framework

axioms such that $0 < k < n$ (dubbed 'quasi-density axioms'). To prove
decidability, we define novel proof systems for quasi-dense logics consisting
of disjunctive existential rules, which are first-order formulae typically used
to specify ontologies in the context of database theory. We show that such
proof systems can be used to generate proofs and models of modal formulae, and
provide an intricate model-theoretic argument showing that such generated
models can be encoded as finite objects called 'templates.' By enumerating
templates of bound size, we obtain an EXPSPACE decision procedure as a

Abstract      = {According to many researchers, conceptual model (CM) development is a hard
task, and system requirements are difficult to collect, causing many
miscommunication problems. CMs require more than modeling ability alone - they
first require an understanding of the targeted domain that the model attempts
to represent. Accordingly, a preconceptual modeling (pre-CM) stage is intended
to address ontological issues before typical CM development is initiated. It
involves defining a portion of reality when entities and processes are
differentiated and integrated as unified wholes. This pre-CM phase forms the
focus of research in this paper. The purpose is not show how to model; rather,
it is to demonstrate how to establish a metaphysical basis of the involved
portion of reality. To demonstrate such a venture, we employ the so-called
thinging machine (TM) modeling that has been proposed as a high-level CM. A TM
model integrates staticity and dynamism grounded in a fundamental construct
called a thimac (things/machine). It involves two modes of reality, existence
(events) and subsistence (regions - roughly, specifications of things and
processes). Currently, the dominant approach in CM has evolved to limit its
scope of application to develop ontological categorization (types of things).
In the TM approach, pre-CM metaphysics is viewed as a part and parcel of CM
itself. The general research problem is how to map TM constructs to what is out
there in the targeted domain. Discussions involve the nature of thimacs (things
and processes) and subsistence and existence as they are superimposed over each
other in reality. Specifically, we make two claims, (a) the perceptibility of
regions as a phenomenon and (b) the distinctiveness of existence as a construct
for events. The results contribute to further the understanding of TM modeling
in addition to introducing some metaphysical insights.},

Abstract      = {The protein-ligand binding affinity (PLA) prediction goal is to predict
whether or not the ligand could bind to a protein sequence. Recently, in PLA
prediction, deep learning has received much attention. Two steps are involved
in deep learning-based approaches: feature extraction and task prediction step.
Many deep learning-based approaches concentrate on introducing new feature
extraction networks or integrating auxiliary knowledge like protein-protein
interaction networks or gene ontology knowledge. Then, a task prediction
network is designed simply using some fully connected layers. This paper aims
to integrate retrieved similar hard protein-ligand pairs in PLA prediction
(i.e., task prediction step) using a semi-supervised graph convolutional
network (GCN). Hard protein-ligand pairs are retrieved for each input query
sample based on the manifold smoothness constraint. Then, a graph is learned
automatically in which each node is a protein-ligand pair, and each edge
represents the similarity between pairs. In other words, an end-to-end
framework is proposed that simultaneously retrieves hard similar samples,
learns protein-ligand descriptor, learns the graph topology of the input sample
with retrieved similar hard samples (learn adjacency matrix), and learns a
semi-supervised GCN to predict the binding affinity (as task predictor). The
training step adjusts the parameter values, and in the inference step, the
learned model is fine-tuned for each input sample. To evaluate the proposed
approach, it is applied to the four well-known PDBbind, Davis, KIBA, and
BindingDB datasets. The results show that the proposed method significantly
performs better than the comparable approaches.},

as negatives. Furthermore, they do not utilize the deductive closure of an
ontology to identify statements that are inferred but not asserted. We
evaluated a set of embedding methods for $\mathcal{EL}^{++}$ ontologies based
on high-dimensional ball representation of concept descriptions, incorporating
several modifications that aim to make use of the ontology deductive closure.
In particular, we designed novel negative losses that account both for the
deductive closure and different types of negatives. We demonstrate that our

specialized themes (e.g., specialized scientific research) and rapidly evolving
contexts (e.g., breaking news or disaster tracking). To tackle such challenges,
we propose a theme-specific knowledge graph (i.e., ThemeKG), a KG constructed
from a theme-specific corpus, and design an unsupervised framework for ThemeKG
construction (named TKGCon). The framework takes raw theme-specific corpus and
generates a high-quality KG that includes salient entities and relations under
the theme. Specifically, we start with an entity ontology of the theme from
Wikipedia, based on which we then generate candidate relations by Large
Language Models (LLMs) to construct a relation ontology. To parse the documents
from the theme corpus, we first map the extracted entity pairs to the ontology
and retrieve the candidate relations. Finally, we incorporate the context and
ontology to consolidate the relations for entity pairs. We observe that
directly prompting GPT-4 for theme-specific KG leads to inaccurate entities
(such as "two main types" as one entity in the query result) and unclear (such
as "is", "has") or wrong relations (such as "have due to", "to start"). In
contrast, by constructing the theme-specific KG step by step, our model
outperforms GPT-4 and could consistently identify accurate entities and
relations. Experimental results also show that our framework excels in
evaluations compared with various KG construction baselines.},

Industry 4.0. The efficacy of Artificial Intelligence broadly hinges on the
caliber of data used during its training phase; optimal performance is tied to
exceptional data quality. Data cleaning tools, particularly those that exploit
functional dependencies within ontological frameworks or context models, are

Abstract      = {Ontology and knowledge graph matching systems are evaluated annually by the
Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI). More and more systems use
machine learning-based approaches, including large language models. The
training and validation datasets are usually determined by the system developer
and often a subset of the reference alignments are used. This sampling is
against the OAEI rules and makes a fair comparison impossible. Furthermore,
those models are trained offline (a trained and optimized model is packaged
into the matcher) and therefore the systems are specifically trained for those
tasks. In this paper, we introduce a dataset that contains training,
validation, and test sets for most of the OAEI tracks. Thus, online model
learning (the systems must adapt to the given input alignment without human
intervention) is made possible to enable a fair comparison for ML-based
systems. We showcase the usefulness of the dataset by fine-tuning the
confidence thresholds of popular systems.},

Abstract      = {With recent advancements in the sixth generation (6G) communication

enhanced automation capabilities. In this paper, we present a network intent
decomposition and optimization mechanism in an energy-aware radio access
network scenario. By characterizing the intent ontology with a standard
template, we present a generic network intent representation framework. Then we
propose a novel intent modeling method using Knowledge Acquisition in automated
Specification language, which can model the network ontology. To clarify the
number and types of network objectives and energy-saving operations, we develop
a Softgoal Interdependency Graph-based network intent decomposition model, and
thus, a network intent decomposition algorithm is presented. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms without conflict analysis
in intent decomposition time. Moreover, we design a deep Q-network-assisted
intent optimization scheme to validate the performance gain.},

Abstract      = {Relation extraction (RE) aims to identify relations between entities
mentioned in texts. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated
impressive in-context learning (ICL) abilities in various tasks, they still
suffer from poor performances compared to most supervised fine-tuned RE
methods. Utilizing ICL for RE with LLMs encounters two challenges: (1)
retrieving good demonstrations from training examples, and (2) enabling LLMs
exhibit strong ICL abilities in RE. On the one hand, retrieving good
demonstrations is a non-trivial process in RE, which easily results in low
relevance regarding entities and relations. On the other hand, ICL with an LLM
achieves poor performance in RE while RE is different from language modeling in
nature or the LLM is not large enough. In this work, we propose a novel
recall-retrieve-reason RE framework that synergizes LLMs with retrieval corpora
(training examples) to enable relevant retrieving and reliable in-context
reasoning. Specifically, we distill the consistently ontological knowledge from
training datasets to let LLMs generate relevant entity pairs grounded by
retrieval corpora as valid queries. These entity pairs are then used to
retrieve relevant training examples from the retrieval corpora as
demonstrations for LLMs to conduct better ICL via instruction tuning. Extensive
experiments on different LLMs and RE datasets demonstrate that our method
generates relevant and valid entity pairs and boosts ICL abilities of LLMs,
achieving competitive or new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-level RE
compared to previous supervised fine-tuning methods and ICL-based methods.},

Abstract      = {Objective: Clinical trials are essential for advancing pharmaceutical
interventions, but they face a bottleneck in selecting eligible participants.
Although leveraging electronic health records (EHR) for recruitment has gained
popularity, the complex nature of unstructured medical texts presents
challenges in efficiently identifying participants. Natural Language Processing
(NLP) techniques have emerged as a solution with a recent focus on transformer
models. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the performance of a prompt-based
large language model for the cohort selection task from unstructured medical
notes collected in the EHR. Methods: To process the medical records, we
selected the most related sentences of the records to the eligibility criteria
needed for the trial. The SNOMED CT concepts related to each eligibility
criterion were collected. Medical records were also annotated with MedCAT based
on the SNOMED CT ontology. Annotated sentences including concepts matched with
the criteria-relevant terms were extracted. A prompt-based large language model
(Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) in this study) was then used with the
extracted sentences as the training set. To assess its effectiveness, we
evaluated the model's performance using the dataset from the 2018 n2c2
challenge, which aimed to classify medical records of 311 patients based on 13
eligibility criteria through NLP techniques. Results: Our proposed model showed
the overall micro and macro F measures of 0.9061 and 0.8060 which were among
the highest scores achieved by the experiments performed with this dataset.
Conclusion: The application of a prompt-based large language model in this
study to classify patients based on eligibility criteria received promising
scores. Besides, we proposed a method of extractive summarization with the aid
of SNOMED CT ontology that can be also applied to other medical texts.},

determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster

should be semantically similar, but the number of data experts should still be
reasonable for training and inference. As such, we consider the ontology in

each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four

hierarchical structure of a lexical ontology, we introduce a novel
compositional symbolic representation for concepts based on their position in
the taxonomical hierarchy. This representation provides richer semantic
information and enhances interpretability. We introduce a neural "taxonomical"
semantic parser to utilize this new representation system of predicates, and
compare it with a standard neural semantic parser trained on the traditional
meaning representation format, employing a novel challenge set and evaluation
metric for evaluation. Our experimental findings demonstrate that the
taxonomical model, trained on much richer and complex meaning representations,
is slightly subordinate in performance to the traditional model using the
standard metrics for evaluation, but outperforms it when dealing with
out-of-vocabulary concepts. This finding is encouraging for research in
computational semantics that aims to combine data-driven distributional

a particular application context, thus making their understanding and adoption
difficult. Application profiles of a given standard - defined as sets of
ontological entities drawn from one or more semantic artefacts for a particular
context or application - are usually proposed as tools for promoting
interoperability and reuse while being tied entirely to the particular
application context they refer to. In this paper, we present an adaptation and

creation of robust, semantically sound application profiles of large standard
models. Using an existing pilot study we have developed in a project dedicated

we introduce an application profile named CHAD-AP, that we have developed

robots that bootstrap structured representations to classify some intelligible

without invalidating the identified category models when a new additional
category is considered. To tackle this scenario, we presented the Scene
Identification and Tagging (SIT) algorithm, which bootstraps structured
knowledge representation in a crisp OWL-DL ontology. Over time, SIT bootstraps
a graph representing scenes, sub-scenes and similar scenes. Then, SIT can
classify new scenes within the bootstrapped graph through logic-based
reasoning. However, SIT has issues with sensory data because its crisp
implementation is not robust to perception noises. This paper presents a
reformulation of SIT within the fuzzy domain, which exploits a fuzzy DL
ontology to overcome the robustness issues. By comparing the performances of
fuzzy and crisp implementations of SIT, we show that fuzzy SIT is robust,

Abstract      = {Ontology Matching (OM), is a critical task in knowledge integration, where
aligning heterogeneous ontologies facilitates data interoperability and
knowledge sharing. Traditional OM systems often rely on expert knowledge or
predictive models, with limited exploration of the potential of Large Language
Models (LLMs). We present the LLMs4OM framework, a novel approach to evaluate
the effectiveness of LLMs in OM tasks. This framework utilizes two modules for
retrieval and matching, respectively, enhanced by zero-shot prompting across
three ontology representations: concept, concept-parent, and concept-children.
Through comprehensive evaluations using 20 OM datasets from various domains, we
demonstrate that LLMs, under the LLMs4OM framework, can match and even surpass
the performance of traditional OM systems, particularly in complex matching
scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to significantly
contribute to the field of OM.},

Abstract      = {The paper tackles the issue of mapping logic axioms formalised in the
Ontology Web Language (OWL) within the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
paradigm. The issues of mapping OWL axioms hierarchies and OOP objects
hierarchies are due to OWL-based reasoning algorithms, which might change an
OWL hierarchy at runtime; instead, OOP hierarchies are usually defined as
static structures. Although programming paradigms based on reflection allow
changing the OOP hierarchies at runtime and mapping OWL axioms dynamically,
there are no currently available mechanisms that do not limit the reasoning
algorithms. Thus, the factory-based paradigm is typically used since it
decouples the OWL and OOP hierarchies. However, the factory inhibits OOP
polymorphism and introduces a paradigm shift with respect to widely accepted
OOP paradigms. We present the OWLOOP API, which exploits the factory to not
limit reasoning algorithms, and it provides novel OOP interfaces concerning the
axioms in an ontology. OWLOOP is designed to limit the paradigm shift required
for using ontologies while improving, through OOP-like polymorphism, the
modularity of software architectures that exploit logic reasoning. The paper
details our OWL to OOP mapping mechanism, and it shows the benefits and
limitations of OWLOOP through examples concerning a robot in a smart
environment.},

Abstract      = {As spacecraft journey further from Earth with more complex missions, systems
of greater autonomy and onboard intelligence are called for. Reducing reliance
on human-based mission control becomes increasingly critical if we are to
increase our rate of solar-system-wide exploration. Recent work has explored
AI-based goal-oriented systems to increase the level of autonomy in mission
execution. These systems make use of symbolic reasoning managers to make
inferences from the state of a spacecraft and a handcrafted knowledge base,
enabling autonomous generation of tasks and re-planning. Such systems have
proven to be successful in controlled cases, but they are difficult to
implement as they require human-crafted ontological models to allow the
spacecraft to understand the world. Reinforcement learning has been applied to
train robotic agents to pursue a goal. A new architecture for autonomy is
called for. This work explores the application of Large Language Models (LLMs)
as the high-level control system of a spacecraft. Using a systems engineering
approach, this work presents the design and development of an agentic
spacecraft controller by leveraging an LLM as a reasoning engine, to evaluate
the utility of such an architecture in achieving higher levels of spacecraft
autonomy. A series of deep space mission scenarios simulated within the popular
game engine Kerbal Space Program (KSP) are used as case studies to evaluate the
implementation against the requirements. It is shown the reasoning and planning
abilities of present-day LLMs do not scale well as the complexity of a mission
increases, but this can be alleviated with adequate prompting frameworks and
strategic selection of the agent's level of authority over the host spacecraft.
This research evaluates the potential of LLMs in augmenting autonomous
decision-making systems for future robotic space applications.},

therefore, largely remain unused. This is due to the sheer volume of datasets

Abstract      = {Background. Endowing intelligent systems with semantic data commonly requires
designing and instantiating ontologies with domain-specific knowledge.
Especially in the early phases, those activities are typically performed
manually by human experts possibly leveraging on their own experience. The
resulting process is therefore time-consuming, error-prone, and often biased by
the personal background of the ontology designer. Objective. To mitigate that
issue, we propose a novel domain-independent approach to automatically
instantiate ontologies with domain-specific knowledge, by leveraging on large
language models (LLMs) as oracles. Method. Starting from (i) an initial schema
composed by inter-related classes and properties and (ii) a set of query
templates, our method queries the LLM multiple times, and generates instances
for both classes and properties from its replies. Thus, the ontology is
automatically filled with domain-specific knowledge, compliant to the initial
schema. As a result, the ontology is quickly and automatically enriched with
manifold instances, which experts may consider to keep, adjust, discard, or
complement according to their own needs and expertise. Contribution. We
formalise our method in general way and instantiate it over various LLMs, as
well as on a concrete case study. We report experiments rooted in the
nutritional domain where an ontology of food meals and their ingredients is
automatically instantiated from scratch, starting from a categorisation of
meals and their relationships. There, we analyse the quality of the generated
ontologies and compare ontologies attained by exploiting different LLMs.
Experimentally, our approach achieves a quality metric that is up to five times
higher than the state-of-the-art, while reducing erroneous entities and
relations by up to ten times. Finally, we provide a SWOT analysis of the
proposed method.},

Abstract      = {This paper introduces the concept of a design tool for artistic performances
based on attribute descriptions. To do so, we used a specific performance of
falling actions. The platform integrates a novel machine-learning (ML) model
with an interactive interface to generate and visualize artistic movements. Our
approach's core is a cyclic Attribute-Conditioned Variational Autoencoder
(AC-VAE) model developed to address the challenge of capturing and generating
realistic 3D human body motions from motion capture (MoCap) data. We created a
unique dataset focused on the dynamics of falling movements, characterized by a
new ontology that divides motion into three distinct phases: Impact, Glitch,
and Fall. The ML model's innovation lies in its ability to learn these phases
separately. It is achieved by applying comprehensive data augmentation
techniques and an initial pose loss function to generate natural and plausible
motion. Our web-based interface provides an intuitive platform for artists to
engage with this technology, offering fine-grained control over motion
attributes and interactive visualization tools, including a 360-degree view and
a dynamic timeline for playback manipulation. Our research paves the way for a
future where technology amplifies the creative potential of human expression,
making sophisticated motion generation accessible to a wider artistic
community.},

Abstract      = {Concept embeddings offer a practical and efficient mechanism for injecting
commonsense knowledge into downstream tasks. Their core purpose is often not to
predict the commonsense properties of concepts themselves, but rather to
identify commonalities, i.e.\ sets of concepts which share some property of
interest. Such commonalities are the basis for inductive generalisation, hence
high-quality concept embeddings can make learning easier and more robust.
Unfortunately, standard embeddings primarily reflect basic taxonomic
categories, making them unsuitable for finding commonalities that refer to more
specific aspects (e.g.\ the colour of objects or the materials they are made
of). In this paper, we address this limitation by explicitly modelling the
different facets of interest when learning concept embeddings. We show that
this leads to embeddings which capture a more diverse range of commonsense
properties, and consistently improves results in downstream tasks such as
ultra-fine entity typing and ontology completion.},

lines of action. Building upon international standards and previous work
towards a global soil data ontology, an improved domain model was eventually
developed within the GSP [54], the basis for a Global Soil Information System

operationalise the domain model. This article presents the GloSIS web ontology,
an implementation of the GloSIS domain model with the Web Ontology Language

GeoSPARQL, QUDT), GloSIS lays out not only a soil data ontology but also an
extensive set of ready-to-use code-lists for soil description and

proposed for tgds to ensure chase termination, typically by forbidding some
kind of "cycle" in the chase process. We propose a new criterion that
explicitly allows some such cycles, and yet ensures termination of the standard
chase under reasonable conditions. This leads to new decidable fragments of
tgds that are not only syntactically more general but also strictly more
expressive than the fragments defined by prior acyclicity conditions. Indeed,
while known terminating fragments are restricted to PTime data complexity, our
conditions yield decidable languages for any k-ExpTime. We further refine our
syntactic conditions to obtain fragments of tgds for which an optimised chase
procedure decides query entailment in PSpace or k-ExpSpace, respectively.},

feasibility of MQM annotation but there are, to our knowledge, no computational
models that predict MQM scores for novel texts, due to a lack of resources. In
this paper, we address these shortcomings by (a) providing a 1200-sentence MQM
evaluation benchmark for the language pair English-Korean and (b) reframing MT
evaluation as the multi-task problem of simultaneously predicting several MQM
scores using SOTA language models, both in a reference-based MT evaluation
setup and a reference-free quality estimation (QE) setup. We find that
reference-free setup outperforms its counterpart in the style dimension while
reference-based models retain an edge regarding accuracy. Overall, RemBERT
emerges as the most promising model. Through our evaluation, we offer an
insight into the translation quality in a more fine-grained, interpretable

Abstract      = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are nowadays the model of choice in
Computer Vision, thanks to their ability to automatize the feature extraction
process in visual tasks. However, the knowledge acquired during training is
fully subsymbolic, and hence difficult to understand and explain to end users.
In this paper, we propose a new technique called HOLMES (HOLonym-MEronym based
Semantic inspection) that decomposes a label into a set of related concepts,
and provides component-level explanations for an image classification model.
Specifically, HOLMES leverages ontologies, web scraping and transfer learning
to automatically construct meronym (parts)-based detectors for a given holonym
(class). Then, it produces heatmaps at the meronym level and finally, by
probing the holonym CNN with occluded images, it highlights the importance of
each part on the classification output. Compared to state-of-the-art saliency
methods, HOLMES takes a step further and provides information about both where
and what the holonym CNN is looking at, without relying on densely annotated
datasets and without forcing concepts to be associated to single computational
units. Extensive experimental evaluation on different categories of objects
(animals, tools and vehicles) shows the feasibility of our approach. On
average, HOLMES explanations include at least two meronyms, and the ablation of
a single meronym roughly halves the holonym model confidence. The resulting
heatmaps were quantitatively evaluated using the
deletion/insertion/preservation curves. All metrics were comparable to those
achieved by GradCAM, while offering the advantage of further decomposing the
heatmap in human-understandable concepts, thus highlighting both the relevance
of meronyms to object classification, as well as HOLMES ability to capture it.

facilitated by open-source LLMs. Our pipeline involves formulating competency
questions (CQs), developing an ontology (TBox) based on these CQs, constructing
KGs using the developed ontology, and evaluating the resultant KG with minimal

semi-automated pipeline by creating a KG on deep learning methodologies by
exploiting scholarly publications. To evaluate the answers generated via
Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG) as well as the KG concepts automatically

Abstract      = {Context-aware Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a hot research area in
mobile computing, and the most effective solutions in the literature are based
on supervised deep learning models. However, the actual deployment of these
systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for
training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction
to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human
activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep
learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on
knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design,
implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require
significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain
expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)
effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work,
we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from
LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and
the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires
limited human effort and expertise. An extensive evaluation carried out on two
public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense
knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to
similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches
with a fraction of the effort.},

Abstract      = {Ontology engineering (OE) in large projects poses a number of challenges
arising from the heterogeneous backgrounds of the various stakeholders, domain

pages). After collecting evidence on the most crucial OE activities, we
introduce \textbf{OntoChat}, a framework for conversational ontology
engineering that supports requirement elicitation, analysis, and testing. By
interacting with a conversational agent, users can steer the creation of user
stories and the extraction of competency questions, while receiving
computational support to analyse the overall requirements and test early
versions of the resulting ontologies. We evaluate OntoChat by replicating the
engineering of the Music Meta Ontology, and collecting preliminary metrics on
the effectiveness of each component from users. We release all code at

Abstract      = {This paper develops a spatiotemporal model for the visualization of dynamic
topologies of hybrid spaces. The visualization of spatiotemporal data is a
well-known problem, for example in digital twins in urban planning. There is
also a lack of a basic ontology for understanding hybrid spaces. The developed
spatiotemporal model has three levels: a level of places and media types, a
level of perception and a level of time and interaction. Existing concepts and
types of representation of hybrid spaces are presented. The space-time model is
tested on the basis of an art exhibition. Two hypotheses guide the accompanying
online survey: (A) there are correlations between media use (modality), the
participants' interactions (creativity) and their perception (understanding of
art) and (B) individual parameters (demographic data, location and situation,
individual knowledge) influence perception (understanding of art). The range,
the number of interactions and the response rate were also evaluated.
  The online survey generally showed a positive correlation between media use
(modality) and individual activity (creativity). However, due to the low
participation rate ($P_{TN} = 14$), the survey is unfortunately not very
representative. Various dynamic topologies of hybrid spaces were successfully
visualized. The joint representation of real and virtual places and media types
conveys a new basic understanding of place, range and urban density.
Relationships between modality, Mobility and communicative interaction become
visible. The current phenomenon of multilocality has been successfully mapped.
The space-time model enables more precise class and structure formation, for
example in the development of digital twins. Dynamic topologies of hybrid
spaces, such as in social media, at events or in urban development, can thus be
better represented and compared.},

focus on annotating many high-quality examples for a few event types. To verify
our hypothesis, we construct an automatically generated Diverse Event
Definition (DivED) dataset and conduct comparative studies. Our experiments
reveal that a large number of event types (200) and diverse event definitions
can significantly boost event extraction performance; on the other hand, the
performance does not scale with over ten examples per event type. Beyond
scaling, we incorporate event ontology information and hard-negative samples
during training, further boosting the performance. Based on these findings, we
fine-tuned a LLaMA-2-7B model on our DivED dataset, yielding performance that
surpasses SOTA large language models like GPT-3.5 across three open benchmarks

(equational theorem proving and term model construction specifically). We also
describe how (generalized) homomorphisms between graphs can be used to write
such relational conjunctive (select-from-where) queries, which, due to the lack

LLMs deploy multiple parallel pathways of answer generation for step-by-step
reasoning. These parallel pathways provide sequential answers from the input
question context as well as the generated CoT. We observe a functional rift in
the middle layers of the LLM. Token representations in the initial half remain
strongly biased towards the pretraining prior, with the in-context prior taking
over in the later half. This internal phase shift manifests in different
functional components: attention heads that write the answer token appear in
the later half, attention heads that move information along ontological
relationships appear in the initial half, and so on. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first attempt towards mechanistic investigation of CoT
reasoning in LLMs.},

selection which eventually locates the edge to be placed into. In all steps, we

Abstract      = {Born's rule is the recipe for calculating probabilities from quantum
mechanical amplitudes. There is no generally accepted derivation of Born's rule
from first principles. In this paper, it is motivated from assumptions that
link the ontological content of a proper physical model to the epistemic
conditions of the experimental context. More precisely, it is assumed that all
knowable distinctions should correspond to distinctions in a proper model. This
principle of "ontological completeness" means, for example, that the
probabilistic treatment of the double slit experiment with and without path
information should differ. Further, it is assumed that the model should rely
only on knowable ontological elements, and that failure to fulfill this
principle of "ontological minimalism" gives rise to wrong predictions.
Consequently, probabilities should be assigned only to observable experimental
outcomes. Also, the method to calculate such probabilities should not rely on
the existence of a precise path of the observed object if this path is not
knowable. A similar principle was promoted by Born, even though he did not
apply it to probability. Another crucial assumption is that the proper rule to
calculate probabilities should be generally valid. It should be applicable in
all experimental contexts, regardless the setup that determines which
attributes of the studied object are observed, together with the probability to
observe each of the associated attribute values. There is no need to refer to
the Hilbert space structure of quantum mechanics in the present treatment.

capture the global and local information in annotation axioms by means of the
occurring locations of each word in a set of axioms and the co-occurrences of
words in each axiom. The self-matching training method increases the robustness
of the concept subsumption prediction when predicted superclasses are similar
to subclasses and are isolated to other entities in an ontology. Our evaluation

conceptual model of a target domain. The model is based on ontological
exploration of things in reality. Many things in such a process closely tie to
problems in metaphysics, the field of inquiry of what reality fundamentally is.
According to some researchers, metaphysicians are trying to develop an account
of the world that properly conceptualizes the way it is, and software design is
similar. Notions such as classes, object orientation, properties,
instantiation, algorithms, etc. are metaphysical concepts developed many years
ago. Exploring the metaphysics of such notions aims to establish quality
assurance though some objective foundation not subject to misapprehensions and
conventions. Much metaphysical work might best be understood as a
model-building process. Here, a model is viewed as a hypothetical structure
that we describe and investigate to understand more complex, real-world
systems. The purpose of this paper is to enhance understanding of the
metaphysical origins of conceptual modeling as exemplified by a specific
proposed high-level model called thinging machines (TMs). The focus is on
thimacs (things/machine) as a single category of TM modeling in the context of

Abstract      = {Incident management for large cloud services is a complex and tedious process
and requires significant amount of manual efforts from on-call engineers
(OCEs). OCEs typically leverage data from different stages of the software
development lifecycle [SDLC] (e.g., codes, configuration, monitor data, service
properties, service dependencies, trouble-shooting documents, etc.) to generate
insights for detection, root causing and mitigating of incidents. Recent
advancements in large language models [LLMs] (e.g., ChatGPT, GPT-4, Gemini)
created opportunities to automatically generate contextual recommendations to
the OCEs assisting them to quickly identify and mitigate critical issues.
However, existing research typically takes a silo-ed view for solving a certain
task in incident management by leveraging data from a single stage of SDLC. In
this paper, we demonstrate that augmenting additional contextual data from
different stages of SDLC improves the performance of two critically important
and practically challenging tasks: (1) automatically generating root cause
recommendations for dependency failure related incidents, and (2) identifying
ontology of service monitors used for automatically detecting incidents. By
leveraging 353 incident and 260 monitor dataset from Microsoft, we demonstrate
that augmenting contextual information from different stages of the SDLC
improves the performance over State-of-The-Art methods.},

Abstract      = {Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) is a major concern for public health organizations
worldwide, especially as regards the adolescent population. The consumption of
alcohol in adolescents is known to be influenced by seeing friends and even
parents drinking alcohol. Building on this fact, a number of studies into
alcohol consumption among adolescents have made use of Social Network Analysis
(SNA) techniques to study the different social networks (peers, friends,
family, etc.) with whom the adolescent is involved. These kinds of studies need
an initial phase of data gathering by means of questionnaires and a subsequent
analysis phase using the SNA techniques. The process involves a number of
manual data handling stages that are time consuming and error-prone. The use of
knowledge engineering techniques (including the construction of a domain
ontology) to represent the information, allows the automation of all the
activities, from the initial data collection to the results of the SNA study.
This paper shows how a knowledge model is constructed, and compares the results
obtained using the traditional method with this, fully automated model,
detailing the main advantages of the latter. In the case of the SNA analysis,
the validity of the results obtained with the knowledge engineering approach
are compared to those obtained manually using the UCINET, Cytoscape, Pajek and
Gephi to test the accuracy of the knowledge model.},

Abstract      = {We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language
models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank
adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating
strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the
resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create
never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is
inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where
neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical
manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any
existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the
underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific
capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning
capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The
impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models
with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of
knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired
materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics
and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of
physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics
forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including
ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The
model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical
properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also
reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain
distinct molecular behaviors.},

Abstract      = {In the current environment of data generation and publication, there is an
ever-growing number of datasets available for download. This growth
precipitates an existing challenge: sourcing and integrating relevant datasets
for analysis is becoming more complex. Despite efforts by open data platforms,
obstacles remain, predominantly rooted in inadequate metadata, unsuitable data
presentation, complications in pinpointing desired data, and data integration.
This paper delves into the intricacies of dataset retrieval, emphasizing the
pivotal role of metadata in aligning datasets with user queries. Through an
exploration of existing literature, it underscores prevailing issues such as
the identification of valuable metadata and the development of tools to
maintain and annotate them effectively. The central contribution of this
research is the proposition of a dataset metadata maturity model. Deriving
inspiration from software engineering maturity models, this framework
delineates a progression from rudimentary metadata documentation to advanced
levels, aiding dataset creators in their documentation efforts. The model
encompasses seven pivotal dimensions, spanning content to quality information,
each stratified across five maturity levels to guide the optimal documentation
of datasets, ensuring ease of discovery, relevance assessment, and
comprehensive dataset understanding. This paper also incorporates the maturity
model into a data cataloguing tool called CKAN through a custom plugin,
CKANext-udc. The plugin introduces custom fields based on different maturity
levels, allows for user interface customisation, and integrates with a graph
database, converting catalogue data into a knowledge graph based on the
Maturity Model ontology.},

Abstract      = {Metamodeling is a general approach to expressing knowledge about classes and
properties in an ontology. It is a desirable modeling feature in multiple
applications that simplifies the extension and reuse of ontologies.
Nevertheless, allowing metamodeling without restrictions is problematic for
several reasons, mainly due to undecidability issues. Practical languages,
therefore, forbid classes to occur as instances of other classes or treat such
occurrences as semantically different objects. Specifically, meta-querying in
SPARQL under the Direct Semantic Entailment Regime (DSER) uses the latter
approach, thereby effectively not supporting meta-queries. However, several
extensions enabling different metamodeling features have been proposed over the
last decade. This paper deals with the Metamodeling Semantics (MS) over OWL 2
QL and the Metamodeling Semantic Entailment Regime (MSER), as proposed in
Lenzerini et al. (2015) and Lenzerini et al. (2020); Cima et al. (2017). A
reduction from OWL 2 QL to Datalog for meta-querying was proposed in Cima et
al. (2017). In this paper, we experiment with various logic programming tools
that support Datalog querying to determine their suitability as back-ends to
MSER query answering. These tools stem from different logic programming
paradigms (Prolog, pure Datalog, Answer Set Programming, Hybrid Knowledge
Bases). Our work shows that the Datalog approach to MSER querying is practical
also for sizeable ontologies with limited resources (time and memory). This
paper significantly extends Qureshi & Faber (2021) by a more detailed
experimental analysis and more background. Under consideration in Theory and

Besides the ontology itself, different rules are represented by SWRL and SPARQL
queries. A Knowledge Based System was created using OntoSNAQA and applied to a
real case study in order to show the advantages of the approach. Finally, the
results of an SNA analysis obtained through the model were compared to those

Abstract      = {Complex systems are not entirely decomposable, hence interdependences arise

existing technical literature and a small pilot to identify the characteristics
of future data-driven solutions. We set out an approach to digital twin-based
interface management and an agenda for research on advanced methodologies for
managing change in complex projects. This agenda includes the need to integrate
work on identifying systems interfaces, change propagation and visualisation,
and the potential to significantly extend the limitations of existing solutions

Abstract      = {Here we present the training and evaluation of NanoNER, a Named Entity
Recognition (NER) model for Nanobiology. NER consists in the identification of
specific entities in spans of unstructured texts and is often a primary task in
Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Extraction. The aim of our
model is to recognise entities previously identified by domain experts as
constituting the essential knowledge of the domain. Relying on ontologies,
which provide us with a domain vocabulary and taxonomy, we implemented an
iterative process enabling experts to determine the entities relevant to the
domain at hand. We then delve into the potential of distant supervision
learning in NER, supporting how this method can increase the quantity of
annotated data with minimal additional manpower. On our full corpus of 728
full-text nanobiology articles, containing more than 120k entity occurrences,
NanoNER obtained a F1-score of 0.98 on the recognition of previously known
entities. Our model also demonstrated its ability to discover new entities in
the text, with precision scores ranging from 0.77 to 0.81. Ablation experiments
further confirmed this and allowed us to assess the dependency of our approach
on the external resources. It highlighted the dependency of the approach to the
resource, while also confirming its ability to rediscover up to 30% of the
ablated terms. This paper details the methodology employed, experimental
design, and key findings, providing valuable insights and directions for future
related researches on NER in specialized domain. Furthermore, since our
approach require minimal manpower , we believe that it can be generalized to
other specialized fields.},

Abstract      = {Most existing medication recommendation models learn representations for
medical concepts based on electronic health records (EHRs) and make
recommendations with learnt representations. However, most medications appear
in the dataset for limited times, resulting in insufficient learning of their
representations. Medical ontologies are the hierarchical classification systems
for medical terms where similar terms are in the same class on a certain level.
In this paper, we propose OntoMedRec, the logically-pretrained and
model-agnostic medical Ontology Encoders for Medication Recommendation that
addresses data sparsity problem with medical ontologies. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on benchmark datasets to evaluate the effectiveness
of OntoMedRec, and the result shows the integration of OntoMedRec improves the
performance of various models in both the entire EHR datasets and the
admissions with few-shot medications. We provide the GitHub repository for the
source code on https://anonymous.4open.science/r/OntoMedRec-D123},

Abstract      = {Background: Single-Subject Design is used in several areas such as education
and biomedicine. However, no suited formal vocabulary exists for annotating the
detailed configuration and the results of this type of research studies with
the appropriate granularity for looking for information about them. Therefore,
the search for those study designs relies heavily on a syntactical search on
the abstract, keywords or full text of the publications about the study, which
entails some limitations. Objective: To present SSDOnt, a specific purpose
ontology for describing and annotating single-subject design studies, so that
complex questions can be asked about them afterwards. Methods: The ontology was
developed following the NeOn methodology. Once the requirements of the ontology
were defined, a formal model was described in a Description Logic and later
implemented in the ontology language OWL 2 DL. Results: We show how the
ontology provides a reference model with a suitable terminology for the
annotation and searching of single-subject design studies and their main
components, such as the phases, the intervention types, the outcomes and the
results. Some mappings with terms of related ontologies have been established.
We show as proof-of-concept that classes in the ontology can be easily extended
to annotate more precise information about specific interventions and outcomes
such as those related to autism. Moreover, we provide examples of some types of
queries that can be posed to the ontology. Conclusions: SSDOnt has achieved the
purpose of covering the descriptions of the domain of single-subject research
studies.},

Abstract      = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
diverse natural language processing tasks, yet their ability to memorize
structured knowledge remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the
extent to which general-purpose pre-trained LLMs retain and correctly reproduce
concept identifier (ID)-label associations from publicly available ontologies.
We conduct a systematic evaluation across multiple ontological resources,
including the Gene Ontology, Uberon, Wikidata, and ICD-10, using LLMs such as
Pythia-12B, Gemini-1.5-Flash, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Our findings reveal that only
a small fraction of ontological concepts is accurately memorized, with GPT-4
demonstrating the highest performance. To understand why certain concepts are
memorized more effectively than others, we analyze the relationship between
memorization accuracy and concept popularity on the Web. Our results indicate a
strong correlation between the frequency of a concept's occurrence online and
the likelihood of accurately retrieving its ID from the label. This suggests
that LLMs primarily acquire such knowledge through indirect textual exposure
rather than directly from structured ontological resources. Furthermore, we
introduce new metrics to quantify prediction invariance, demonstrating that the
stability of model responses across variations in prompt language and
temperature settings can serve as a proxy for estimating memorization
robustness.},

Abstract      = {In this paper an agent-based simulation is developed in order to evaluate an
AmI scenario based on agents. Many AmI applications are implemented through
agents but they are not compared to any other existing alternative in order to
evaluate the relative benefits of using them. The proposal simulation
environment developed in Netlogo analyse such benefits using two evaluation
criteria: First, measuring agent satisfaction of different types of desires
along the execution. Second, measuring time savings obtained through a correct
use of context information.
  So, here, a previously suggested agent architecture, an ontology and a
12-steps protocol to provide AmI services in airports, is evaluated using a
NetLogo simulation environment. The present work uses a NetLogo model
considering scalability problems of this application domain but using FIPA and
BDI extensions to be coherent with our previous works and our previous JADE
implementation of them.
  The NetLogo model presented simulates an airport with agent users passing
through several zones located in a specific order in a map: passport controls,
check-in counters of airline companies, boarding gates, different types of
shopping. Although initial data in simulations are generated randomly, and the
model is just an approximation of real-world airports, the definition of this
case of use of Ambient Intelligence through NetLogo agents opens an interesting
way to evaluate the benefits of using Ambient Intelligence, which is a
significant contribution to the final development of them.},

terms focus on semantic aspects. As a result, their descriptions are
independent of languages and technology aspects used in different organizations
to represent EHRs. Moreover, those terms are related to their corresponding
codes in well-known medical terminologies. Second, it deals with modules that
allow obtaining rich ontological representations of EHR information managed by
proprietary models of health information systems. The features of one specific
module are shown as reference. Third, it considers the necessary mapping axioms
between ontological terms enhanced with so-called path mappings. This feature
smoothes out structural differences between heterogeneous EHR representations,
allowing proper alignment of information.},

for expressing descriptions about components of an extruder, spatial

the sensors used to capture indicators about the performance of this type of

First, we integrate multifaceted information encompassing medical codes,

bimodal contrastive losses, all of which pivot around a medical codes

Abstract      = {Ontologies contain rich knowledge within domain, which can be divided into

Extensional knowledge provides information about the concrete instances that

details inherent properties, characteristics, and semantic associations among
concepts. However, existing ontology embedding approaches fail to take both
extensional knowledge and intensional knowledge into fine consideration
simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a novel ontology embedding approach
named EIKE (Extensional and Intensional Knowledge Embedding) by representing
ontologies in two spaces, called extensional space and intensional space. EIKE
presents a unified framework for embedding instances, concepts and their
relations in an ontology, applying a geometry-based method to model extensional
knowledge and a pretrained language model to model intensional knowledge, which
can capture both structure information and textual information. Experimental
results show that EIKE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in
three datasets for both triple classification and link prediction, indicating
that EIKE provides a more comprehensive and representative perspective of the
domain.},

ontology of emotions: the Emotion Frames Ontology (EFO). EFO treats emotions as
semantic frames, with a set of semantic roles that capture the different
aspects of emotional experience. EFO follows pattern-based ontology design, and
is aligned to the DOLCE foundational ontology. EFO is used to model multiple
emotion theories, which can be cross-linked as modules in an Emotion Ontology
Network. In this paper, we exemplify it by modeling Ekman's Basic Emotions (BE)
Theory as an EFO-BE module, and demonstrate how to perform automated inferences
on the representation of emotion situations. EFO-BE has been evaluated by
lexicalizing the BE emotion frames from within the Framester knowledge graph,
and implementing a graph-based emotion detector from text. In addition, an EFO
integration of multimodal datasets, including emotional speech and emotional
face expressions, has been performed to enable further inquiry into crossmodal

Abstract      = {Planning and reasoning about actions and processes, in addition to reasoning
about propositions, are important issues in recent logical and computer science
studies. The widespread use of actions in everyday life such as IoT, semantic
web services, etc., and the limitations and issues in the action formalisms are
two factors that lead us to study how actions are represented.
  Since 2007, there have been some ideas to integrate Description Logic (DL)
and action formalisms for representing both static and dynamic knowledge.
Meanwhile, time is an important factor in dynamic situations, and actions
change states over time. In this study, on the one hand, we examined related
logical structures such as extensions of description logics (DLs), temporal
formalisms, and action formalisms. On the other hand, we analyzed possible
tools for designing and developing the Knowledge and Action Base (KAB).
  For representation and reasoning about actions, we embedded actions into DLs
(such as Dynamic-ALC and its extensions). We propose a terminable algorithm for
action projection, planning, checking the satisfiability, consistency,
realizability, and executability, and also querying from KAB. Actions in this
framework were modeled with SPIN and added to state space. This framework has
also been implemented as a plugin for the Prot\'eg\'e ontology editor.
  During the last two decades, various algorithms have been presented, but due
to the high computational complexity, we face many problems in implementing
dynamic ontologies. In addition, an algorithm to detect the inconsistency of
actions' effects was not explicitly stated. In the proposed strategy, the
interactions of actions with other parts of modeled knowledge, and a method to
check consistency between the effects of actions are presented. With this
framework, the ramification problem can be well handled in future works.},

Abstract      = {Wheat varieties show a large diversity of traits and phenotypes. Linking them
to genetic variability is essential for shorter and more efficient wheat
breeding programs. Newly desirable wheat variety traits include disease
resistance to reduce pesticide use, adaptation to climate change, resistance to
heat and drought stresses, or low gluten content of grains. Wheat breeding
experiments are documented by a large body of scientific literature and
observational data obtained in-field and under controlled conditions. The
cross-referencing of complementary information from the literature and
observational data is essential to the study of the genotype-phenotype
relationship and to the improvement of wheat selection. The scientific
literature on genetic marker-assisted selection describes much information
about the genotype-phenotype relationship. However, the variety of expressions
used to refer to traits and phenotype values in scientific articles is a hinder
to finding information and cross-referencing it. When trained adequately by
annotated examples, recent text mining methods perform highly in named entity
recognition and linking in the scientific domain. While several corpora contain
annotations of human and animal phenotypes, currently, no corpus is available
for training and evaluating named entity recognition and entity-linking methods
in plant phenotype literature. The Triticum aestivum trait Corpus is a new gold
standard for traits and phenotypes of wheat. It consists of 540 PubMed
references fully annotated for trait, phenotype, and species named entities
using the Wheat Trait and Phenotype Ontology and the species taxonomy of the
National Center for Biotechnology Information. A study of the performance of
tools trained on the Triticum aestivum trait Corpus shows that the corpus is
suitable for the training and evaluation of named entity recognition and
linking.},

Abstract      = {Recently, the Industry 5.0 is gaining attention as a novel paradigm, defining
the next concrete steps toward more and more intelligent, green-aware and
user-centric digital systems. In an era in which smart devices typically
adopted in the industry domain are more and more sophisticated and autonomous,
the Internet of Things and its evolution, known as the Internet of Everything
(IoE, for short), involving also people, robots, processes and data in the
network, represent the main driver to allow industries to put the experiences
and needs of human beings at the center of their ecosystems. However, due to
the extreme heterogeneity of the involved entities, their intrinsic need and
capability to cooperate, and the aim to adapt to a dynamic user-centric
context, special attention is required for the integration and processing of
the data produced by such an IoE. This is the objective of the present paper,
in which we propose a novel semantic model that formalizes the fundamental
actors, elements and information of an IoE, along with their relationships. In
our design, we focus on state-of-the-art design principles, in particular
reuse, and abstraction, to build ``SemIoE'', a lightweight ontology inheriting
and extending concepts from well-known and consolidated reference ontologies.
The defined semantic layer represents a core data model that can be extended to
embrace any modern industrial scenario. It represents the base of an IoE
Knowledge Graph, on top of which, as an additional contribution, we analyze and
define some essential services for an IoE-based industry.},

Abstract      = {User interaction is one of the most effective ways to improve the ontology
alignment quality. However, this approach faces the challenge of how users can
participate effectively in the matching process. To solve this challenge. In
this paper, an interactive ontology alignment approach using compact
differential evolution algorithm with adaptive parameter control (IOACDE) is
proposed. In this method, the ontology alignment process is modeled as an
interactive optimization problem and users are allowed to intervene in matching
in two ways. One is that the mapping suggestions generated by IOACDE as a
complete candidate alignment is evaluated by user during optimization process.
The other is that the user ameliorates the alignment results by evaluating
single mapping after the automatic matching process. To demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, the neural embedding model and K
nearest neighbor (KNN) is employed to simulate user for the ontologies of the
real world. The experimental results show that the proposed interactive
approach can improve the alignment quality compared to the non-interactive.
Compared with the state-of-the-art methods from OAEI, the results show that the
proposed algorithm has a better performance under the same error rate.},

essence-property-relation models, production systems, predicate calculus
models, conceptual models, and others. To combine and structure various
fragments of knowledge, archigraph models are used, constructed as a
development of annotated metagraphs. As components, the cognitive architecture
being developed includes machine consciousness, machine subconsciousness,
blocks of interaction with the external environment, a goal management block,
an emotional control system, a block of social interaction, a block of

Abstract      = {In today's data-rich environment, recommender systems play a crucial role in
decision support systems. They provide to users personalized recommendations
and explanations about these recommendations. Embedding-based models, despite
their widespread use, often suffer from a lack of interpretability, which can
undermine trust and user engagement. This paper presents an approach that
combines embedding-based and semantic-based models to generate post-hoc
explanations in recommender systems, leveraging ontology-based knowledge graphs
to improve interpretability and explainability. By organizing data within a
structured framework, ontologies enable the modeling of intricate relationships
between entities, which is essential for generating explanations. By combining
embedding-based and semantic based models for post-hoc explanations in
recommender systems, the framework we defined aims at producing meaningful and
easy-to-understand explanations, enhancing user trust and satisfaction, and
potentially promoting the adoption of recommender systems across the e-commerce

Abstract      = {There are concerns about the reliability and safety of artificial
intelligence (AI) based on sub-symbolic neural networks because its decisions
cannot be explained explicitly. This is the black box problem of modern AI. At
the same time, symbolic AI has the nature of a white box and is able to ensure
the reliability and safety of its decisions. However, several problems prevent
the widespread use of symbolic AI: the opacity of mathematical models and
natural language terms, the lack of a unified ontology, and the combinatorial
explosion of search capabilities. To solve the black-box problem of AI, we
propose eXplicitly eXplainable AI (XXAI) - a fully transparent white-box AI
based on deterministic logical cellular automata whose rules are derived from
the first principles of the general theory of the relevant domain. In this
case, the general theory of the domain plays the role of a knowledge base for
deriving the inferences of the cellular automata. A cellular automaton
implements parallel multi-level logical inference at all levels of organization
- from local interactions of the element base to the system as a whole. Our
verification of several ecological hypotheses sets a precedent for the
successful implementation of the proposed solution. XXAI is able to
automatically verify the reliability, security and ethics of sub-symbolic
neural network solutions in both the final and training phases. In this
article, we present precedents for the successful implementation of XXAI, the
theoretical and methodological foundations for its further development, and
discuss prospects for the future.},

Abstract      = {Crystalline materials, such as metals and semiconductors, nearly always
contain a special defect type called dislocation. This defect decisively
determines many important material properties, e.g., strength, fracture
toughness, or ductility. Over the past years, significant effort has been put
into understanding dislocation behavior across different length scales via
experimental characterization techniques and simulations. This paper introduces
the dislocation ontology (DISO), which defines the concepts and relationships
related to linear defects in crystalline materials. We developed DISO using a
top-down approach in which we start defining the most general concepts in the
dislocation domain and subsequent specialization of them. DISO is published
through a persistent URL following W3C best practices for publishing Linked
Data. Two potential use cases for DISO are presented to illustrate its
usefulness in the dislocation dynamics domain. The evaluation of the ontology
is performed in two directions, evaluating the success of the ontology in
modeling a real-world domain and the richness of the ontology.},

Abstract      = {A critical function of an organization is to foster the level of integration
(coordination and cooperation) necessary to achieve its objectives. The need to
coordinate and motivation to cooperate emerges from the myriad dependencies
between an organization's members and their work. Therefore, to reason about
solutions to coordination and cooperation problems requires a robust
representation that includes the underlying dependencies. We find that such a
representation remains missing from formal organizational models, and we
leverage semantics to bridge this gap. Drawing on well-established
organizational research and our extensive fieldwork with one of North America's
largest municipalities, (1) we introduce an ontology, formalized in first-order
logic, that operationalizes concepts like outcome, reward, and epistemic
dependence, and their links to potential integration risks; and (2) present
real-world applications of this ontology to analyze and support integration in
complex government infrastructure projects. Our ontology is implemented and
validated in both Z3 and OWL. Key features of our model include inferable
dependencies, explainable coordination and cooperation risks, and actionable
insights on how dependency structures within an organization can be altered to
mitigate the risks. Conceptualizing real-world challenges like incentive
misalignment, free-riding, and subgoal optimization in terms of dependency
structures, our semantics-based approach represents a novel method for
modelling and enhancing coordination and cooperation. Integrated within a
decision-support system, our model may serve as an impactful aid for
organizational design and effectiveness. More broadly, our approach underscores
the transformative potential of semantics in deriving tangible, real-world
value from existing organization theory.},

extend this idea to axiomatize \textit{General Extensional Mereology}, also
called \textit{Classical Mereology}, which is neutral regarding the existence
of atoms. I give a proof that classical mereology is axiomatizable using
primitive mereological fusion within the framework of two-sorted logic, as I
announced in \cite{Ly22}. The use of the primitive notion of fusion instead of
primitive notion of \textit{part} was considered by G. Leibniz

primitive mereological sum \cite[222]{Sb84}. However, Lejewski's theory is
formulated in non-classical language of Le\'sniewski's ontology and contains
complicated quantification over function symbols, including quantification on
\textit{part of} and \textit{sum of}. Lejewski's approach is not expressible in
modern mereologies. The presented theory is the first contemporary
axiomatization of classical mereology in two-sorted logic with primitive

includes partitioning knowledge graphs into smaller subgraphs, fine-tuning
adapter modules for each subgraph, and combining the knowledge in a fusion

setups were designed to assess ML and FT model performance across different
data availability scenarios.Datasets for curation tasks included: task 1

(trained on ~260,000 triples) outperformed ICL in accuracy across all tasks.

Abstract      = {This paper proposes an approach to build 3D scene graphs in arbitrary indoor
and outdoor environments. Such extension is challenging; the hierarchy of
concepts that describe an outdoor environment is more complex than for indoors,
and manually defining such hierarchy is time-consuming and does not scale.
Furthermore, the lack of training data prevents the straightforward application
of learning-based tools used in indoor settings. To address these challenges,
we propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a spatial
ontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot
operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an
ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second,
we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic
Tensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., "a beach contains
sand"), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus
reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even
allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time. We test our approach in a
variety of datasets, including indoor, rural, and coastal environments, and
show that it leads to a significant increase in the quality of the 3D scene
graph generation with sparsely annotated data.},

Abstract      = {Background: Ontologies are fundamental components of informatics
infrastructure in domains such as biomedical, environmental, and food sciences,
representing consensus knowledge in an accurate and computable form. However,
their construction and maintenance demand substantial resources and necessitate
substantial collaboration between domain experts, curators, and ontology
experts. We present Dynamic Retrieval Augmented Generation of Ontologies using
AI (DRAGON-AI), an ontology generation method employing Large Language Models
(LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). DRAGON-AI can generate textual
and logical ontology components, drawing from existing knowledge in multiple
ontologies and unstructured text sources.
  Results: We assessed performance of DRAGON-AI on de novo term construction
across ten diverse ontologies, making use of extensive manual evaluation of
results. Our method has high precision for relationship generation, but has
slightly lower precision than from logic-based reasoning. Our method is also
able to generate definitions deemed acceptable by expert evaluators, but these
scored worse than human-authored definitions. Notably, evaluators with the
highest level of confidence in a domain were better able to discern flaws in
AI-generated definitions. We also demonstrated the ability of DRAGON-AI to
incorporate natural language instructions in the form of GitHub issues.
  Conclusions: These findings suggest DRAGON-AI's potential to substantially
aid the manual ontology construction process. However, our results also
underscore the importance of having expert curators and ontology editors drive
the ontology generation process.},

Abstract      = {Dictionary learning (DL) is commonly used in computational biology to tackle
ubiquitous clustering problems due to its conceptual simplicity and relatively
low computational complexity. However, DL algorithms produce results that lack
interpretability and are not optimized for large-scale graph-structured data.
We propose a novel DL algorithm called online convex network dictionary
learning (online cvxNDL) that can handle extremely large datasets and enables
the interpretation of dictionary elements, which serve as cluster
representatives, through convex combinations of real measurements. Moreover,
the algorithm can be applied to network-structured data via specialized
subnetwork sampling techniques.
  To demonstrate the utility of our approach, we apply cvxNDL on 3D-genome
RNAPII ChIA-Drop data to identify important long-range interaction patterns.
ChIA-Drop probes higher-order interactions, and produces hypergraphs whose
nodes represent genomic fragments. The hyperedges represent observed physical
contacts. Our hypergraph model analysis creates an interpretable dictionary of
long-range interaction patterns that accurately represent global chromatin
physical contact maps. Using dictionary information, one can also associate the
contact maps with RNA transcripts and infer cellular functions.
  Our results offer two key insights. First, we demonstrate that online cvxNDL
retains the accuracy of classical DL methods while simultaneously ensuring
unique interpretability and scalability. Second, we identify distinct
collections of proximal and distal interaction patterns involving chromatin
elements shared by related processes across different chromosomes, as well as
patterns unique to specific chromosomes. To associate the dictionary elements
with biological properties of the corresponding chromatin regions, we employ
Gene Ontology enrichment analysis and perform RNA coexpression studies.},

  with Applications on Constructing Biomedical Knowledge Graphs},
Eprint        = {2312.08036v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Objective: Biomedical Knowledge Graphs play a pivotal role in various
biomedical research domains. Concurrently, term clustering emerges as a crucial
step in constructing these knowledge graphs, aiming to identify synonymous
terms. Due to a lack of knowledge, previous contrastive learning models trained
with Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) synonyms struggle at clustering
difficult terms and do not generalize well beyond UMLS terms. In this work, we
leverage the world knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) and propose
Contrastive Learning for Representing Terms via Explanations (CoRTEx) to
enhance term representation and significantly improves term clustering.
Materials and Methods: The model training involves generating explanations for
a cleaned subset of UMLS terms using ChatGPT. We employ contrastive learning,
considering term and explanation embeddings simultaneously, and progressively
introduce hard negative samples. Additionally, a ChatGPT-assisted BIRCH
algorithm is designed for efficient clustering of a new ontology. Results: We
established a clustering test set and a hard negative test set, where our model
consistently achieves the highest F1 score. With CoRTEx embeddings and the
modified BIRCH algorithm, we grouped 35,580,932 terms from the Biomedical
Informatics Ontology System (BIOS) into 22,104,559 clusters with O(N) queries
to ChatGPT. Case studies highlight the model's efficacy in handling challenging
samples, aided by information from explanations. Conclusion: By aligning terms
to their explanations, CoRTEx demonstrates superior accuracy over benchmark
models and robustness beyond its training set, and it is suitable for
clustering terms for large-scale biomedical ontologies.},

evaluations demonstrate that the small-sized pre-trained language model (PLM)
won over the other two extra-large language models by a large margin, in the
clinical domain fine-tuning, which finding was never reported in the field.
Finally, the transfer learning method works well in our experimental setting
using the WMT21fb model to accommodate a new language space Spanish that was
not seen at the pre-training stage within WMT21fb itself, which deserves more
exploitation for clinical knowledge transformation, e.g. to investigate into
more languages. These research findings can shed some light on domain-specific

inspiration from various studies on biological/ecological networks and discover
motifs from patent knowledge graphs. We identify four 3-node and four 4-node

Abstract      = {Recommender systems have gained increasing attention to personalise consumer
preferences. While these systems have primarily focused on applications such as
advertisement recommendations (e.g., Google), personalized suggestions (e.g.,
Netflix and Spotify), and retail selection (e.g., Amazon), there is potential
for these systems to benefit from a more global, socio-economic, and culturally
aware approach, particularly as companies seek to expand into diverse markets.
This paper aims to investigate the potential of a recommender system that
considers cultural identity and socio-economic factors. We review the most
recent developments in recommender systems and explore the impact of cultural
identity and socio-economic factors on consumer preferences. We then propose an
ontology and approach for incorporating these factors into recommender systems.
To illustrate the potential of our approach, we present a scenario in consumer
subscription plan selection within the entertainment industry. We argue that
existing recommender systems have limited ability to precisely understand user
preferences due to a lack of awareness of socio-economic factors and cultural
identity. They also fail to update recommendations in response to changing
socio-economic conditions. We explore various machine learning models and
develop a final artificial neural network model (ANN) that addresses this gap.
We evaluate the effectiveness of socio-economic and culturally aware
recommender systems across four dimensions: Precision, Accuracy, F1, and
Recall. We find that a highly tuned ANN model incorporating domain-specific
data, select cultural indices and relevant socio-economic factors predicts user
preference in subscriptions with an accuracy of 95%, a precision of 94%, a F1
Score of 92\%, and a Recall of 90\%.},

Abstract      = {Most existing ontology matching methods utilize the literal information to
discover alignments. However, some literal information in ontologies may be
opaque and some ontologies may not have sufficient literal information. In this
paper, these ontologies are named as weak informative ontologies (WIOs) and it
is challenging for existing methods to matching WIOs. On one hand, string-based
and linguistic-based matching methods cannot work well for WIOs. On the other
hand, some matching methods use external resources to improve their
performance, but collecting and processing external resources is still
time-consuming. To address this issue, this paper proposes a practical method
for matching WIOs by employing the ontology structure information to discover
alignments. First, the semantic subgraphs are extracted from the ontology graph
to capture the precise meanings of ontology elements. Then, a new similarity
propagation model is designed for matching WIOs. Meanwhile, in order to avoid
meaningless propagation, the similarity propagation is constrained by semantic
subgraphs and other conditions. Consequently, the similarity propagation model
ensures a balance between efficiency and quality during matching. Finally, the
similarity propagation model uses a few credible alignments as seeds to find
more alignments, and some useful strategies are adopted to improve the
performance. This matching method for WIOs has been implemented in the ontology
matching system Lily. Experimental results on public OAEI benchmark datasets
demonstrate that Lily significantly outperforms most of the state-of-the-art
works in both WIO matching tasks and general ontology matching tasks. In
particular, Lily increases the recall by a large margin, while it still obtains
high precision of matching results.},

Abstract      = {The utilization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) for clinical risk

comprehensive health records, making it challenging to apply standard machine
learning algorithms in practical real-world scenarios. Previous research has
addressed this data limitation by incorporating medical ontologies and
employing transfer learning methods. In this study, we investigate the
potential of leveraging language models (LMs) as a means to incorporate
supplementary domain knowledge for improving the performance of various
EHR-based risk prediction tasks. Unlike applying LMs to unstructured EHR data
such as clinical notes, this study focuses on using textual descriptions within
structured EHR to make predictions exclusively based on that information. We
extensively compare against previous approaches across various data types and

diagnostic histories, leads to improved or at least comparable performance in
diverse risk prediction tasks. Furthermore, LM-based approaches offer numerous
advantages, including few-shot learning, the capability to handle previously
unseen medical concepts, and adaptability to various medical vocabularies.
Nevertheless, we underscore, through various experiments, the importance of
being cautious when employing such models, as concerns regarding the
reliability of LMs persist.},

Abstract      = {Over the years, RDF streaming was explored in research and practice from many
angles, resulting in a wide range of RDF stream definitions. This variety
presents a major challenge in discussing and integrating streaming systems, due
to the lack of a common language. This work attempts to address this critical
research gap, by systematizing RDF stream types present in the literature in a
novel taxonomy. The proposed RDF Stream Taxonomy (RDF-STaX) is embodied in an
OWL 2 DL ontology that follows the FAIR principles, making it readily
applicable in practice. Extensive documentation and additional resources are
provided, to foster the adoption of the ontology. Three use cases for the
ontology are presented with accompanying competency questions, demonstrating
the usefulness of the resource. Additionally, this work introduces a novel
nanopublications dataset, which serves as a collaborative, living
state-of-the-art review of RDF streaming. The results of a multifaceted
evaluation of the resource are presented, testing its logical validity, use
case coverage, and adherence to the community's best practices, while also
comparing it to other works. RDF-STaX is expected to help drive innovation in
RDF streaming, by fostering scientific discussion, cooperation, and tool
interoperability.},

Abstract      = {In this paper, I develop a novel version of the multiverse theory of sets
called hierarchical pluralism by introducing the notion of `degrees of

of reconciling epistemological realism and the multiverse theory of sets so as
to preserve a considerable amount of epistemic objectivity when working with
the multiverse theory. I give some arguments in favour of a hierarchical
picture of the multiverse in which theories or models are thought to be ordered
with respect to their plausibility, as a manifestation of endorsing the idea
that some set theories are more plausible than others. The proposed multiverse
account settles the pluralist's dilemma, the dichotomy that there is a
trade-off between the richness of mathematical ontology and the objectivity of
mathematical truth. The view also extends and serves as an alternative position
to Balaguer's intention-based Platonism from which he claims that a certain
version of mathematical pluralism follows.},

Abstract      = {The lack of explainability using relevant clinical knowledge hinders the
adoption of Artificial Intelligence-powered analysis of unstructured clinical
dialogue. A wealth of relevant, untapped Mental Health (MH) data is available
in online communities, providing the opportunity to address the explainability
problem with substantial potential impact as a screening tool for both online

transformer models and generate clinician-understandable explanations for
classification by incorporating external clinical knowledge. Inspired by how
clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage
relevant clinical knowledge to model patient inputs, providing meaningful
explanations for classification. This will save manual review time and engender
trust. We develop such a system in the context of MH using clinical practice
guidelines (CPG) for diagnosing depression, a mental health disorder of global
concern. We propose an application-specific language model called ProcesS
knowledge-infused cross ATtention (PSAT), which incorporates CPGs when
computing attention. Through rigorous evaluation on three expert-curated
datasets related to depression, we demonstrate application-relevant
explainability of PSAT. PSAT also surpasses the performance of nine baseline
models and can provide explanations where other baselines fall short. We
transform a CPG resource focused on depression, such as the Patient Health
Questionnaire (e.g. PHQ-9) and related questions, into a machine-readable
ontology using SNOMED-CT. With this resource, PSAT enhances the ability of
models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations.},

Abstract      = {In this paper we relate notions of nonclassicality in the simplest nontrivial
scenario (a prepare and measure scenario composed of four preparations and two
binary-outcome tomographically complete measurements). Specifically, we relate
the established method developed in [Pusey, PRA 98,022112(2018)] to witness a
violation of preparation noncontextuality, that is not suitable in experiments
where the operational equivalences to be tested are specified in advance, with
an approach based on the notion of bounded ontological distinctness for
preparations, defined in [Chaturvedi and Saha, Quantum 4, 345 (2020)]. In our
approach, we test bounded ontological distinctness for two particular
preparations that are relevant in certain information processing tasks in that
they are associated with the even- and odd-parity of the bits to communicate.
When there exists an ontological model where this distance is preserved we talk
of parity preservation. Our main result provides a noise threshold under which
violating parity preservation (and so bounded ontological distinctness) agrees
with the established method for witnessing preparation contextuality in the
simplest nontrivial scenario. This is achieved by first relating the violation
of parity preservation to the quantification of contextuality in terms of
inaccessible information as developed in [Marvian, arXiv:2003.05984(2020)],
that we also show, given the way we quantify noise, to be more robust in
witnessing contextuality than Pusey's noncontextuality inequality. As an
application of our findings, we treat the case of two-bit parity-oblivious
multiplexing in the presence of noise. In particular, we provide a condition
for which the result establishing preparation contextuality as a resource for
the quantum advantage of the protocol in the noiseless case still holds in the
noisy case.},

Abstract      = {One of the significant barriers to the training of statistical models on

challenge is to determine how to manipulate these relational data, which are

enable the learning process. Currently, many high-quality catalogs of knowledge

Abstract      = {Recent years witnessed a rising interest towards Datalog-based ontological

languages, often shared under the collective name of Datalog$+/-$, that extend
Datalog with the essential feature of existential quantification, while
introducing syntactic limitations to sustain reasoning decidability and achieve
a good trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. From an
implementation perspective, modern reasoners borrow the vast experience of the
database community in developing streaming-based data processing systems, such
as volcano-iterator architectures, that sustain a limited memory footprint and
good scalability. In this paper, we focus on two extremely promising,
expressive, and tractable languages, namely, Shy and Warded Datalog$+/-$. We
leverage their theoretical underpinnings to introduce novel reasoning
techniques, technically, "chase variants", that are particularly fit for
efficient reasoning in streaming-based architectures. We then implement them in
Vadalog, our reference streaming-based engine, to efficiently solve ontological
reasoning tasks over real-world settings.},

Abstract      = {Automated driving vehicles~(ADV) promise to enhance driving efficiency and

result, validating ADV within generated safety-critical scenarios is essential
for both development and performance evaluations. This paper investigates the
complexities of employing two major scenario-generation solutions: data-driven
and knowledge-driven methods. Data-driven methods derive scenarios from
recorded datasets, efficiently generating scenarios by altering the existing
behavior or trajectories of traffic participants but often falling short in
considering ADV perception; knowledge-driven methods provide effective coverage
through expert-designed rules, but they may lead to inefficiency in generating
safety-critical scenarios within that coverage. To overcome these challenges,
we introduce BridgeGen, a safety-critical scenario generation framework,
designed to bridge the benefits of both methodologies. Specifically, by
utilizing ontology-based techniques, BridgeGen models the five scenario layers
in the operational design domain (ODD) from knowledge-driven methods, ensuring
broad coverage, and incorporating data-driven strategies to efficiently
generate safety-critical scenarios. An optimized scenario generation toolkit is
developed within BridgeGen. This expedites the crafting of safety-critical
scenarios through a combination of traditional optimization and reinforcement
learning schemes. Extensive experiments conducted using Carla simulator
demonstrate the effectiveness of BridgeGen in generating diverse
safety-critical scenarios.},

appropriate way to describe the intricate relationships between genes.
Interestingly, category theory, an abstract field of mathematics seemingly
unrelated to biology, has emerged as a powerful language for describing
relations in general. We propose that category theory could provide a framework
for unifying our knowledge of genes and their relationships.
  As a starting point, we construct a category of genes, with its morphisms
abstracting various aspects of the relationships betweens genes. These
relationships include, but not limited to, the order of genes on the
chromosomes, the physical or genetic interactions, the signalling pathways, the
gene ontology causal activity models (GO-CAM) and gene groups. Previously, they
were encoded by miscellaneous networks or graphs, while our work unifies them
in a consistent manner as a category. By doing so, we hope to view the
relationships between genes systematically. In the long run, this paves a
promising way for us to understand the fundamental principles that govern gene

Abstract      = {Liver diseases pose a significant global health burden, impacting many
individuals and having substantial economic and social consequences. Rising
liver problems are considered a fatal disease in many countries, such as Egypt
and Moldova. This study aims to develop a diagnosis and treatment model for
liver disease using Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), Patient Clinical Data (PCD)
ontology, and detection rules derived from a decision tree algorithm. For the
development of the ontology, the National Viral Hepatitis Control Program
(NVHCP) guidelines were used, which made the ontology more accurate and
reliable. The Apache Jena framework uses batch processing to detect events
based on these rules. Based on the event detected, queries can be directly
processed using SPARQL. We convert these Decision Tree (DT) and medical
guidelines-based rules into Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) to operationalize
the ontology. Using this SWRL in the ontology to predict different types of
liver disease with the help of the Pellet and Drools inference engines in
Protege Tools, a total of 615 records were taken from different liver diseases.
After inferring the rules, the result can be generated for the patient
according to the rules, and other patient-related details, along with different
precautionary suggestions, can be obtained based on these results. These rules
can make suggestions more accurate with the help of Explainable Artificial
Intelligence (XAI) with open API-based suggestions. When the patient has
prescribed a medical test, the model accommodates this result using optical
character recognition (OCR), and the same process applies when the patient has
prescribed a further medical suggestion according to the test report. These
models combine to form a comprehensive Decision Support System (DSS) for the
diagnosis of liver disease.},

Supporting a component of this process for automation or semi-automation would

WordNet framework for learning concept hierarchies from free texts. The process
has steps. First, the document is Part-Of-Speech labeled, then parsed to
produce sentence parse trees. Verb/noun dependencies are derived from parse
trees next. After lemmatizing, pruning, and filtering the word pairings, the
formal context is created. The formal context may contain some erroneous and
uninteresting pairs because the parser output may be erroneous, not all derived
pairs are interesting, and it may be large due to constructing it from a large
free text corpus. Deriving lattice from the formal context may take longer,
depending on the size and complexity of the data. Thus, decreasing formal
context may eliminate erroneous and uninteresting pairs and speed up idea
lattice derivation. WordNet-based and Frequency-based approaches are tested.
Finally, we compute formal idea lattice and create a classical concept
hierarchy. The reduced concept lattice is compared to the original to evaluate
the outcomes. Despite several system constraints and component discrepancies
that may prevent logical conclusion, the following data imply idea hierarchies
in this project and dissertation are promising. First, the reduced idea lattice
and original concept have commonalities. Second, alternative language or
statistical methods can reduce formal context size. Finally, WordNet-based and
Frequency-based approaches reduce formal context differently, and the order of
applying them is examined to reduce context efficiently.},

development of ontologies e.g. ontology reuse, ontology testing, requirement
specification, and the definition of patterns that implement such requirements.
Although CQs are integral to the majority of ontology engineering
methodologies, the practice of publishing CQs alongside the ontological
artefacts is not widely observed by the community. In this context, we present
an experiment in retrofitting CQs from existing ontologies. We propose
RETROFIT-CQs, a method to extract candidate CQs directly from ontologies using
Generative AI. In the paper we present the pipeline that facilitates the
extraction of CQs by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and we discuss its
application to a number of existing ontologies.},

Large Language Model to choose, how to provide existing correspondences to the
model, how to generate candidates, etc. In this paper, we present a prototype
that explores these questions by applying zero-shot and few-shot prompting with
multiple open Large Language Models to different tasks of the Ontology

music and proteins - such strategies can also provide an interpretable graph

algorithm engineering as a collection of prescriptive and descriptive
knowledge, residing in World 3 of Popper's Three Worlds model. Methodology
refers to the steps how we can systematically enhance our knowledge of specific

Abstract      = {Ontology revision aims to seamlessly incorporate a new ontology into an
existing ontology and plays a crucial role in tasks such as ontology evolution,
ontology maintenance, and ontology alignment. Similar to repair single
ontologies, resolving logical incoherence in the task of ontology revision is
also important and meaningful, because incoherence is a main potential factor
to cause inconsistency and reasoning with an inconsistent ontology will obtain
meaningless answers.To deal with this problem, various ontology revision
approaches have been proposed to define revision operators and design ranking
strategies for axioms in an ontology. However, they rarely consider axiom
semantics which provides important information to differentiate axioms. In
addition, pre-trained models can be utilized to encode axiom semantics, and
have been widely applied in many natural language processing tasks and
ontology-related ones in recent years.Therefore, in this paper, we study how to
apply pre-trained models to revise ontologies. We first define four scoring
functions to rank axioms based on a pre-trained model by considering various
information from an ontology. Based on the functions, an ontology revision
algorithm is then proposed to deal with unsatisfiable concepts at once. To
improve efficiency, an adapted revision algorithm is designed to deal with
unsatisfiable concepts group by group. We conduct experiments over 19 ontology
pairs and compare our algorithms and scoring functions with existing ones.
According to the experiments, our algorithms could achieve promising
performance.},

Abstract      = {We present a method, which incorporates knowledge awareness into the symbolic
computation of discrete controllers for reactive cyber physical systems, to
improve decision making about the unknown operating environment under
uncertain/incomplete inputs. Assuming an abstract model of the system and the
environment, we translate the knowledge awareness of the operating context into
linear temporal logic formulas and incorporate them into the system
specifications to synthesize a controller. The knowledge base is built upon an
ontology model of the environment objects and behavioural rules, which includes
also symbolic models of partial input features. The resulting symbolic
controller support smoother, early reactions, which improves the security of
the system over existing approaches based on incremental symbolic perception. A
motion planning case study for an autonomous vehicle has been implemented to
validate the approach, and presented results show significant improvements with
respect to safety of state-of-the-art symbolic controllers for reactive
systems.},

Abstract      = {We investigate semiring provenance--a successful framework originally defined
in the relational database setting--for description logics. In this context,
the ontology axioms are annotated with elements of a commutative semiring and
these annotations are propagated to the ontology consequences in a way that
reflects how they are derived. We define a provenance semantics for a language
that encompasses several lightweight description logics and show its
relationships with semantics that have been defined for ontologies annotated
with a specific kind of annotation (such as fuzzy degrees). We show that under
some restrictions on the semiring, the semantics satisfies desirable properties
(such as extending the semiring provenance defined for databases). We then
focus on the well-known why-provenance, for which we study the complexity of
problems related to the provenance of an assertion or a conjunctive query
answer. Finally, we consider two more restricted cases which correspond to the
so-called positive Boolean provenance and lineage in the database setting. For
these cases, we exhibit relationships with well-known notions related to
explanations in description logics and complete our complexity analysis. As a
side contribution, we provide conditions on an $\mathcal{ELHI}_\bot$ ontology
that guarantee tractable reasoning.},

parsing structured data sources such as ChEMBL as the basis for data within a

order to make data access more expressive and interoperable. In this survey, we
review recent approaches with a specific focus on the application within data
lake systems and scalability to Big Data. We classify the approaches into (i)
basic semantic data management, (ii) semantic modeling approaches for enriching
metadata in data lakes, and (iii) methods for ontologybased data access. In

process yielding data quality and control over its lifecycle is a prerequisite
to getting value out of this data and minimizing inherent risks related to
multiple usages. Common data governance frameworks rely on people, policies,
and processes that fall short of the overwhelming complexity of data. Yet,
harnessing this complexity is necessary to achieve high-quality standards. The
latter will condition any downstream data usage outcome, including generative
artificial intelligence trained on this data. In this paper, we report our
concrete experience establishing a simple, cost-efficient framework that
enables metadata-driven, agile and (semi-)automated data governance (i.e. Data
Governance 4.0). We explain how we implement and use this framework to
integrate 25 years of clinical study data at an enterprise scale in a fully
productive environment. The framework encompasses both methodologies and
technologies leveraging semantic web principles. We built a knowledge graph
describing avatars of data assets in their business context, including
governance principles. Multiple ontologies articulated by an enterprise upper
ontology enable key governance actions such as FAIRification, lifecycle
management, definition of roles and responsibilities, lineage across
transformations and provenance from source systems. This metadata model is the
keystone to data governance 4.0: a semi-automatised data management process

This approach, which operates at the intersection of many stakeholders and

cited as being central to achieving performance, yet very few descriptors of
capabilities, evaluations, training methods, or open-source models exist. Given
this lack of information, further study and transparency is needed for learned

optimizing preferences, and articulate lines of inquiry to understand the
sociotechnical context of reward models. In particular, we highlight the
ontological differences between costs, rewards, and preferences at stake in
RLHF's foundations, related methodological tensions, and possible research

gap. Our experiments reveal limited effectiveness in the selective extraction
of contextual action knowledge, suggesting that LLMs may not be sufficient on
their own. However, the large-scale extraction of general, actionable knowledge
shows potential, indicating that LLMs can be a suitable tool for efficiently
creating ontologies for robots. This paper shows that the technique used for

Abstract      = {CityGML is a widely adopted standard by the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC)
for representing and exchanging 3D city models. The representation of semantic
and topological properties in CityGML makes it possible to query such 3D city
data to perform analysis in various applications, e.g., security management and
emergency response, energy consumption and estimation, and occupancy
measurement. However, the potential of querying CityGML data has not been fully
exploited. The official GML/XML encoding of CityGML is only intended as an
exchange format but is not suitable for query answering. The most common way of
dealing with CityGML data is to store them in the 3DCityDB system as relational
tables and then query them with the standard SQL query language. Nevertheless,
for end users, it remains a challenging task to formulate queries over 3DCityDB
directly for their ad-hoc analytical tasks, because there is a gap between the
conceptual semantics of CityGML and the relational schema adopted in 3DCityDB.
In fact, the semantics of CityGML itself can be modeled as a suitable ontology.
The technology of Knowledge Graphs (KGs), where an ontology is at the core, is
a good solution to bridge such a gap. Moreover, embracing KGs makes it easier
to integrate with other spatial data sources, e.g., OpenStreetMap and existing
(Geo)KGs (e.g., Wikidata, DBPedia, and GeoNames), and to perform queries
combining information from multiple data sources. In this work, we describe a
CityGML KG framework to populate the concepts in the CityGML ontology using
declarative mappings to 3DCityDB, thus exposing the CityGML data therein as a
KG. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we use CityGML data from
the city of Munich as test data and integrate OpenStreeMap data in the same
area.},

overall goal is to have a fine-grained and flexible description, more

CIDOC Conceptual Reference Model and additional ontologies, envisioning
interoperability with datasets curated by multiple communities of practice.
Existing ISAD(G)-conforming descriptions are being migrated to the new model
using the direct mappings provided here. We used a sample of 25 records

conformity of ArchOnto to existing data. This work is in progress and is

the balance in the model between the migration of existing records and the
construction of new ones by archive professionals; and (3) it adopts an open

Abstract      = {For centuries, researchers have sought out ways to connect disparate areas of
knowledge. While early scholars (Galileo, da Vinci, etc.) were experts across
fields, specialization has taken hold later. With the advent of Artificial
Intelligence, we can now explore relationships across areas (e.g.,
mechanics-biology) or disparate domains (e.g., failure mechanics-art). To
achieve this, we use a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM), here for a subset
of knowledge in multiscale materials failure. The approach includes the use of
a general-purpose LLM to distill question-answer pairs from raw sources
followed by LLM fine-tuning. The resulting MechGPT LLM foundation model is used
in a series of computational experiments to explore its capacity for knowledge
retrieval, various language tasks, hypothesis generation, and connecting
knowledge across disparate areas. While the model has some ability to recall
knowledge from training, we find that LLMs are particularly useful to extract
structural insights through Ontological Knowledge Graphs. These interpretable
graph structures provide explanatory insights, frameworks for new research
questions, and visual representations of knowledge that also can be used in
retrieval-augmented generation. Three versions of MechGPT are discussed,
featuring different sizes from 13 billion to 70 billion parameters, and
reaching context lengths of more than 10,000 tokens. This provides ample
capacity for sophisticated retrieval augmented strategies, as well as
agent-based modeling where multiple LLMs interact collaboratively and/or
adversarially, the incorporation of new data from the literature or web
searches, as well as multimodality.},

Abstract      = {Domain experts often rely on most recent knowledge for apprehending and

for developing prevention and therapeutic decision-making in various disease
scenarios. A challenging scenarios for artificial intelligence (AI) is using
biomedical data (e.g., texts, imaging, omics, and clinical) to provide
diagnosis and treatment recommendations for cancerous conditions.~Data and
knowledge about biomedical entities like cancer, drugs, genes, proteins, and
their mechanism is spread across structured (knowledge bases (KBs)) and
unstructured (e.g., scientific articles) sources. A large-scale knowledge graph
(KG) can be constructed by integrating and extracting facts about semantically
interrelated entities and relations. Such a KG not only allows exploration and
question answering (QA) but also enables domain experts to deduce new
knowledge. However, exploring and querying large-scale KGs is tedious for
non-domain users due to their lack of understanding of the data assets and
semantic technologies. In this paper, we develop a domain KG to leverage
cancer-specific biomarker discovery and interactive QA. For this, we
constructed a domain ontology called OncoNet Ontology (ONO), which enables
semantic reasoning for validating gene-disease (different types of cancer)
relations. The KG is further enriched by harmonizing the ONO, metadata,
controlled vocabularies, and biomedical concepts from scientific articles by
employing BioBERT- and SciBERT-based information extractors. Further, since the
biomedical domain is evolving, where new findings often replace old ones,
without having access to up-to-date scientific findings, there is a high chance
an AI system exhibits concept drift while providing diagnosis and treatment.
Therefore, we fine-tune the KG using large language models (LLMs) based on more
recent articles and KBs.},

Abstract      = {Fine-grained entity typing (FET) is the task of identifying specific entity

only an ontology is provided. However, most existing ontology structures lack
rich supporting information and even contain ambiguous relations, making them
ineffective in guiding FET. Recently developed language models, though
promising in various few-shot and zero-shot NLP tasks, may face challenges in
zero-shot FET due to their lack of interaction with task-specific ontology. In
this study, we propose OnEFET, where we (1) enrich each node in the ontology
structure with two types of extra information: instance information for
training sample augmentation and topic information to relate types to contexts,
and (2) develop a coarse-to-fine typing algorithm that exploits the enriched
information by training an entailment model with contrasting topics and
instance-based augmented training samples. Our experiments show that OnEFET
achieves high-quality fine-grained entity typing without human annotation,
outperforming existing zero-shot methods by a large margin and rivaling
supervised methods.},

Abstract      = {Generating code from a natural language using Large Language Models (LLMs)
such as ChatGPT, seems groundbreaking. Yet, with more extensive use, it's
evident that this approach has its own limitations. The inherent ambiguity of
natural language presents challenges for complex software designs. Accordingly,
our research offers an Agile Model-Driven Development (MDD) approach that
enhances code auto-generation using OpenAI's GPT-4. Our work emphasizes
"Agility" as a significant contribution to the current MDD method, particularly
when the model undergoes changes or needs deployment in a different programming
language. Thus, we present a case-study showcasing a multi-agent simulation
system of an Unmanned Vehicle Fleet. In the first and second layer of our
approach, we constructed a textual representation of the case-study using
Unified Model Language (UML) diagrams. In the next layer, we introduced two
sets of constraints that minimize model ambiguity. Object Constraints Language
(OCL) is applied to fine-tune the code constructions details, while FIPA
ontology is used to shape communication semantics and protocols. Ultimately,
leveraging GPT-4, our last layer auto-generates code in both Java and Python.
The Java code is deployed within the JADE framework, while the Python code is
deployed in PADE framework. Concluding our research, we engaged in a
comprehensive evaluation of the generated code. From a behavioural standpoint,
the auto-generated code aligned perfectly with the expected UML sequence
diagram. Structurally, we compared the complexity of code derived from UML
diagrams constrained solely by OCL to that influenced by both OCL and
FIPA-ontology. Results indicate that ontology-constrained model produce
inherently more intricate code, but it remains manageable and low-risk for
further testing and maintenance.},

mapping is the process of determining correspondences between entities across
these resources, such as gene identifiers, disease concepts, or chemical entity
identifiers. Many tools have been developed to compute such mappings based on
common structural features and lexical information such as labels and synonyms.
Lexical approaches in particular often provide very high recall, but low
precision, due to lexical ambiguity. As a consequence of this, mapping efforts
often resort to a labor intensive manual mapping refinement through a human
curator.
  Large Language Models (LLMs), such as the ones employed by ChatGPT, have
generalizable abilities to perform a wide range of tasks, including
question-answering and information extraction. Here we present MapperGPT, an
approach that uses LLMs to review and refine mapping relationships as a
post-processing step, in concert with existing high-recall methods that are
based on lexical and structural heuristics.
  We evaluated MapperGPT on a series of alignment tasks from different domains,
including anatomy, developmental biology, and renal diseases. We devised a
collection of tasks that are designed to be particularly challenging for

balance the dynamic interplay between autonomy and alignment across various

the axioms the ontology entails. In this work, we formally prove that
normalized ${\cal ELH}$ has the strong faithfulness property on convex
geometric models, which means that there is an embedding that precisely
captures the original ontology. We present a region-based geometric model for
embedding normalized ${\cal ELH}$ ontologies into a continuous vector space. To
prove strong faithfulness, our construction takes advantage of the fact that
normalized ${\cal ELH}$ has a finite canonical model. We first prove the
statement assuming (possibly) non-convex regions, allowing us to keep the
required dimensions low. Then, we impose convexity on the regions and show the
property still holds. Finally, we consider reasoning tasks on geometric models

Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) models underpinning ChatGPT as a
foundation for the tasks of clinical phenotyping and phenotype annotation.
Materials and Methods: The experimental setup of the study included seven
prompts of various levels of specificity, two GPT models (gpt-3.5-turbo and
gpt-4.0) and two established gold standard corpora for phenotype recognition,
one consisting of publication abstracts and the other clinical observations.
Results: Our results show that, with an appropriate setup, these models can
achieve state of the art performance. The best run, using few-shot learning,
achieved 0.58 macro F1 score on publication abstracts and 0.75 macro F1 score
on clinical observations, the former being comparable with the state of the
art, while the latter surpassing the current best in class tool. Conclusion:
While the results are promising, the non-deterministic nature of the outcomes,
the high cost and the lack of concordance between different runs using the same
prompt and input make the use of these LLMs challenging for this particular

the semantic hierarchy and proximity relationships between sound events. In
contrast, the event descriptions contains richer information, describing the

we explore the impact of training audio tagging models with auxiliary text
descriptions of sound events. By aligning the audio features with the text
features of corresponding labels, we inject the hierarchy and proximity
information of sound events into audio encoders, improving the performance
while making the prediction more consistent with human perception. We refer to
this approach as Semantic Proximity Alignment (SPA). We use Ontology-aware mean
Average Precision (OmAP) as the main evaluation metric for the models. OmAP
reweights the false positives based on Audioset ontology distance and is more
consistent with human perception compared to mAP. Experimental results show
that the audio tagging models trained with SPA achieve higher OmAP compared to
models trained with one-hot labels solely (+1.8 OmAP). Human evaluations also

We then correlated the activity patterns of brain networks represented by

PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Large language models (LLMs) have become phenomenally surging, since
2018--two decades after introducing context-awareness into computing systems.
Through taking into account the situations of ubiquitous devices, users and the
societies, context-aware computing has enabled a wide spectrum of innovative
applications, such as assisted living, location-based social network services
and so on. To recognize contexts and make decisions for actions accordingly,
various artificial intelligence technologies, such as Ontology and OWL, have
been adopted as representations for context modeling and reasoning. Recently,
with the rise of LLMs and their improved natural language understanding and
reasoning capabilities, it has become feasible to model contexts using natural
language and perform context reasoning by interacting with LLMs such as ChatGPT
and GPT-4. In this tutorial, we demonstrate the use of texts, prompts, and
autonomous agents (AutoAgents) that enable LLMs to perform context modeling and
reasoning without requiring fine-tuning of the model. We organize and introduce
works in the related field, and name this computing paradigm as the LLM-driven
Context-aware Computing (LCaC). In the LCaC paradigm, users' requests, sensors
reading data, and the command to actuators are supposed to be represented as
texts. Given the text of users' request and sensor data, the AutoAgent models
the context by prompting and sends to the LLM for context reasoning. LLM
generates a plan of actions and responds to the AutoAgent, which later follows
the action plan to foster context-awareness. To prove the concepts, we use two
showcases--(1) operating a mobile z-arm in an apartment for assisted living,
and (2) planning a trip and scheduling the itinerary in a context-aware and
personalized manner.},

Eprint        = {2309.13130v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.DB},
Abstract      = {OTTR is a language for representing ontology modeling patterns, which enables
to build ontologies or knowledge bases by instantiating templates. Thereby,
particularities of the ontological representation language are hidden from the
domain experts, and it enables ontology engineers to, to some extent, separate
the processes of deciding about what information to model from deciding about
how to model the information, e.g., which design patterns to use. Certain
decisions can thus be postponed for the benefit of focusing on one of these
processes. To date, only few works on ontology engineering where ontology
templates are applied are described in the literature.
  In this paper, we outline our methodology and report findings from our
ontology engineering activities in the domain of Material Science. In these
activities, OTTR templates play a key role. Our ontology engineering process is
bottom-up, as we begin modeling activities from existing data that is then, via
templates, fed into a knowledge graph, and it is top-down, as we first focus on
which data to model and postpone the decision of how to model the data.
  We find, among other things, that OTTR templates are especially useful as a
means of communication with domain experts. Furthermore, we find that because
OTTR templates encapsulate modeling decisions, the engineering process becomes
flexible, meaning that design decisions can be changed at little cost.},

preparation, the total probability remains constant but may be distinct from
unity. The measurement contextuality in this setup arises from the quantum
realizations of the hypergraph, which adhere to a specific bound on the linear
combination of probabilities. In contrast, classical realizations can surpass
this bound. The violation of quantum bounds stems from the inability of
classical ontological models, specifically the set-theoretic representation of
the hypergraph corresponding to the quantum observables' collections, to adhere
to and explain the observed statistics.},

Abstract      = {Wikipedia articles are hierarchically organized through categories and lists,
providing one of the most comprehensive and universal taxonomy, but its open
creation is causing redundancies and inconsistencies. Assigning DBPedia classes
to Wikipedia categories and lists can alleviate the problem, realizing a large
knowledge graph which is essential for categorizing digital contents through
entity linking and typing. However, the existing approach of CaLiGraph is
producing incomplete and non-fine grained mappings. In this paper, we tackle
the problem as ontology alignment, where structural information of knowledge
graphs and lexical and semantic features of ontology class names are utilized
to discover confident mappings, which are in turn utilized for finetuing
pretrained language models in a distant supervision fashion. Our method SLHCat
consists of two main parts: 1) Automatically generating training data by
leveraging knowledge graph structure, semantic similarities, and named entity
typing. 2) Finetuning and prompt-tuning of the pre-trained language model BERT
are carried out over the training data, to capture semantic and syntactic
properties of class names. Our model SLHCat is evaluated over a benchmark
dataset constructed by annotating 3000 fine-grained CaLiGraph-DBpedia mapping
pairs. SLHCat is outperforming the baseline model by a large margin of 25% in
accuracy, offering a practical solution for large-scale ontology mapping.},

Abstract      = {Datasets that pair Knowledge Graphs (KG) and text together (KG-T) can be used
to train forward and reverse neural models that generate text from KG and vice

equivalent can suffer from more hallucination and poorer recall. In this paper,
we verify this empirically by generating datasets with different levels of
noise and find that noisier datasets do indeed lead to more hallucination. We
argue that the ability of forward and reverse models trained on a dataset to
cyclically regenerate source KG or text is a proxy for the equivalence between
the KG and the text in the dataset. Using cyclic evaluation we find that
manually created WebNLG is much better than automatically created TeKGen and
T-REx. Guided by these observations, we construct a new, improved dataset
called LAGRANGE using heuristics meant to improve equivalence between KG and
text and show the impact of each of the heuristics on cyclic evaluation. We
also construct two synthetic datasets using large language models (LLMs), and
observe that these are conducive to models that perform significantly well on
cyclic generation of text, but less so on cyclic generation of KGs, probably
because of a lack of a consistent underlying ontology.},

Abstract      = {Improving the overall equipment effectiveness (OEE) of machines on the shop

computational efforts to coordinate agent activities. One way to improve
communication speed and cooperation capabilities between system agents is by
providing a common language between these agents to represent knowledge about
system behavior. The integration of ontology into multi-agent systems in
manufacturing provides agents with the capability to continuously update and
refine their knowledge in a global context. This paper contributes to the
design of an ontology for multi-agent systems in manufacturing, introducing an
extendable knowledge base and a methodology for continuously updating the
production data by agents during runtime. To demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework, a case study is conducted in a simulated environment,

Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are widely used for representing and organizing

KGs pose substantial challenges. Developing a KG demands extensive expertise in
data modeling, ontology design, and data curation. Furthermore, KGs are
dynamic, requiring continuous updates and quality control to ensure accuracy
and relevance. These intricacies contribute to the considerable effort required
for their development and maintenance. One critical dimension of KGs that
warrants attention is reproducibility. The ability to replicate and validate
KGs is fundamental for ensuring the trustworthiness and sustainability of the
knowledge they represent. Reproducible KGs not only support open science by
allowing others to build upon existing knowledge but also enhance transparency
and reliability in disseminating information. Despite the growing number of
domain-specific KGs, a comprehensive analysis concerning their reproducibility
has been lacking. This paper addresses this gap by offering a general overview
of domain-specific KGs and comparing them based on various reproducibility
criteria. Our study over 19 different domains shows only eight out of 250
domain-specific KGs (3.2%) provide publicly available source code. Among these,
only one system could successfully pass our reproducibility assessment (14.3%).
These findings highlight the challenges and gaps in achieving reproducibility
across domain-specific KGs. Our finding that only 0.4% of published
domain-specific KGs are reproducible shows a clear need for further research

effectively. This paper explores the analysis of various deep learning models

However, existing PLM-probing studies focus mainly on factual knowledge,
lacking a systematic probing of ontological knowledge. In this paper, we focus
on probing whether PLMs store ontological knowledge and have a semantic
understanding of the knowledge rather than rote memorization of the surface
form. To probe whether PLMs know ontological knowledge, we investigate how well
PLMs memorize: (1) types of entities; (2) hierarchical relationships among
classes and properties, e.g., Person is a subclass of Animal and Member of
Sports Team is a subproperty of Member of ; (3) domain and range constraints of
properties, e.g., the subject of Member of Sports Team should be a Person and
the object should be a Sports Team. To further probe whether PLMs truly
understand ontological knowledge beyond memorization, we comprehensively study
whether they can reliably perform logical reasoning with given knowledge
according to ontological entailment rules. Our probing results show that PLMs
can memorize certain ontological knowledge and utilize implicit knowledge in
reasoning. However, both the memorizing and reasoning performances are less

Abstract      = {In our opinion the exuberance surrounding the relative success of data-driven
large language models (LLMs) is slightly misguided and for several reasons (i)
LLMs cannot be relied upon for factual information since for LLMs all ingested
text (factual or non-factual) was created equal; (ii) due to their subsymbolic
na-ture, whatever 'knowledge' these models acquire about language will always
be buried in billions of microfeatures (weights), none of which is meaningful
on its own; and (iii) LLMs will often fail to make the correct inferences in
several linguistic contexts (e.g., nominal compounds, copredication, quantifier
scope ambi-guities, intensional contexts. Since we believe the relative success
of data-driven large language models (LLMs) is not a reflection on the symbolic
vs. subsymbol-ic debate but a reflection on applying the successful strategy of
a bottom-up reverse engineering of language at scale, we suggest in this paper
applying the effective bottom-up strategy in a symbolic setting resulting in
symbolic, explainable, and ontologically grounded language models.},

considerable interest in automating the extraction, normalization, and

genes and diseases. This paper presents SimpleGermKG, an automatic knowledge
graph construction approach that connects germline genes and diseases. For the
extraction of genes and diseases, we employ BioBERT, a pre-trained BERT model
on biomedical corpora. We propose an ontology-based and rule-based algorithm to
standardize and disambiguate medical terms. For semantic relationships between
articles, genes, and diseases, we implemented a part-whole relation approach to
connect each entity with its data source and visualize them in a graph-based
knowledge representation. Lastly, we discuss the knowledge graph applications,
limitations, and challenges to inspire the future research of germline corpora.
Our knowledge graph contains 297 genes, 130 diseases, and 46,747 triples.

Abstract      = {The concept of antidistinguishability of quantum states has been studied to
investigate foundational questions in quantum mechanics. It is also called
quantum state elimination, because the goal of such a protocol is to guess
which state, among finitely many chosen at random, the system is not prepared
in (that is, it can be thought of as the first step in a process of
elimination). Antidistinguishability has been used to investigate the reality
of quantum states, ruling out $\psi$-epistemic ontological models of quantum
mechanics [Pusey et al., Nat. Phys., 8(6):475-478, 2012]. Thus, due to the
established importance of antidistinguishability in quantum mechanics,
exploring it further is warranted.
  In this paper, we provide a comprehensive study of the optimal error exponent
-- the rate at which the optimal error probability vanishes to zero
asymptotically -- for classical and quantum antidistinguishability. We derive
an exact expression for the optimal error exponent in the classical case and
show that it is given by the multivariate classical Chernoff divergence. Our
work thus provides this divergence with a meaningful operational interpretation
as the optimal error exponent for antidistinguishing a set of probability
measures. For the quantum case, we provide several bounds on the optimal error
exponent: a lower bound given by the best pairwise Chernoff divergence of the
states, a single-letter semi-definite programming upper bound, and lower and
upper bounds in terms of minimal and maximal multivariate quantum Chernoff
divergences. It remains an open problem to obtain an explicit expression for
the optimal error exponent for quantum antidistinguishability.},

Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) have emerged as a prominent data representation and
management paradigm. Being usually underpinned by a schema (e.g., an ontology),
KGs capture not only factual information but also contextual knowledge. In some
tasks, a few KGs established themselves as standard benchmarks. However, recent
works outline that relying on a limited collection of datasets is not
sufficient to assess the generalization capability of an approach. In some
data-sensitive fields such as education or medicine, access to public datasets
is even more limited. To remedy the aforementioned issues, we release PyGraft,
a Python-based tool that generates highly customized, domain-agnostic schemas
and KGs. The synthesized schemas encompass various RDFS and OWL constructs,
while the synthesized KGs emulate the characteristics and scale of real-world
KGs. Logical consistency of the generated resources is ultimately ensured by
running a description logic (DL) reasoner. By providing a way of generating
both a schema and KG in a single pipeline, PyGraft's aim is to empower the
generation of a more diverse array of KGs for benchmarking novel approaches in
areas such as graph-based machine learning (ML), or more generally KG
processing. In graph-based ML in particular, this should foster a more holistic
evaluation of model performance and generalization capability, thereby going
beyond the limited collection of available benchmarks. PyGraft is available at:

Abstract      = {Ontologies are traditionally expressed in the Web Ontology Language (OWL),
that provides a syntax for expressing taxonomies with axioms regulating class

the use of automated reasoning to check the consistency of ontologies, perform
classification, and to answer DL queries. However, the open world assumption of
OWL, along with limitations in its expressiveness, makes OWL less suitable for
modelling rules and regulations, used in public administration. In such cases,
it is desirable to have closed world semantics and a rule-based engine to check
compliance with regulations. In this paper we describe and discuss data model
management using the Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL), for concept modelling
of concrete requirements in regulation documents within the public sector. We
show how complex regulations, often containing a number of alternative
requirements, can be expressed as constraints, and the utility of SHACL engines
in verification of instance data against the SHACL model. We discuss benefits
of modelling with SHACL, compared to OWL, and demonstrate the maintainability
of the SHACL model by domain experts without prior knowledge of ontology
management.},

However, applying these techniques to biomedical text often yields
unsatisfactory results because it is hard to infer relations directly from

issues, we present a novel technique called ReOnto, that makes use of neuro
symbolic knowledge for the RE task. ReOnto employs a graph neural network to
acquire the sentence representation and leverages publicly accessible
ontologies as prior knowledge to identify the sentential relation between two
entities. The approach involves extracting the relation path between the two
entities from the ontology. We evaluate the effect of using symbolic knowledge
from ontologies with graph neural networks. Experimental results on two public
biomedical datasets, BioRel and ADE, show that our method outperforms all the
baselines (approximately by 3\%).},

Since manual creation of these models is a time-consuming process, it is

anomalies - can be challenging to interpret due to a lack of additional
information about the system. This paper aims to improve model-based anomaly
detection in CPPS by combining the learned timed automaton with a formal
knowledge graph about the system. Both the model and the detected anomalies are
described in the knowledge graph in order to allow operators an easier
interpretation of the model and the detected anomalies. The authors
additionally propose an ontology of the necessary concepts. The approach was
validated on a five-tank mixing CPPS and was able to formally define both

Abstract      = {Survival analysis plays a crucial role in many healthcare decisions, where
the risk prediction for the events of interest can support an informative
outlook for a patient's medical journey. Given the existence of data censoring,
an effective way of survival analysis is to enforce the pairwise temporal
concordance between censored and observed data, aiming to utilize the time
interval before censoring as partially observed time-to-event labels for
supervised learning. Although existing studies mostly employed ranking methods
to pursue an ordering objective, contrastive methods which learn a
discriminative embedding by having data contrast against each other, have not
been explored thoroughly for survival analysis. Therefore, in this paper, we
propose a novel Ontology-aware Temporality-based Contrastive Survival (OTCSurv)
analysis framework that utilizes survival durations from both censored and
observed data to define temporal distinctiveness and construct negative sample
pairs with adjustable hardness for contrastive learning. Specifically, we first
use an ontological encoder and a sequential self-attention encoder to represent
the longitudinal EHR data with rich contexts. Second, we design a temporal
contrastive loss to capture varying survival durations in a supervised setting
through a hardness-aware negative sampling mechanism. Last, we incorporate the
contrastive task into the time-to-event predictive task with multiple loss
components. We conduct extensive experiments using a large EHR dataset to
forecast the risk of hospitalized patients who are in danger of developing
acute kidney injury (AKI), a critical and urgent medical condition. The
effectiveness and explainability of the proposed model are validated through
comprehensive quantitative and qualitative studies.},

framework CSM-H-R, which programmatically combines ontologies and states at the
modeling phase and runtime phase for attaining the ability to recognize
meaningful HLC. It builds on the model of our prior work on the Context State

management of hierarchy, relationship, and transition. Case studies are
developed for IntellElevator and IntellRestaurant, two intelligent applications
in a smart campus setting. The prototype implementation of the framework
experiments on translating the HLC reasoning into vector and matrix computing
and presents the potential of using advanced probabilistic models to reach the
next level of automation in integrating intelligent systems; meanwhile, privacy
protection support is achieved in the application domain by anonymization
through indexing and reducing information correlation. An implementation of the

Current approaches for planning with DL ontologies integrate the DL directly

on first-order rewritings or rewritings into datalog. We present here a new
approach in which the planning specification and ontology are kept separate,
and are linked together using an interface. This allows planning experts to
work in a familiar formalism, while existing ontologies can be easily
integrated and extended by ontology experts. Our approach for planning with
those ontology-mediated planning problems is optimized for cases with
comparatively small domains, and supports the whole OWL DL fragment. The idea
is to rewrite the ontology-mediated planning problem into a classical planning
problem to be processed by existing planning tools. Different to other

Abstract      = {In conceptual modeling (CM) as a subdiscipline of software engineering,
current proposed ontologies (categorical analysis of entities) are typically
established through whole adoption of philosophical theories (e.g. Bunge s). In
this paper, we pursue an interdisciplinary research approach to develop a
diagrammatic-based ontological foundation for CM using philosophical ontology
as a secondary source. It is an endeavor to escape an offshore procurement of
ontology from philosophy and implant it in CM. In such an effort, the CM
diagrammatic language plays an important role in contrast to dogmatic
philosophical languages obsession with abstract entities. Specifically, this
paper is about developing a descriptive (in contrast to formal) ontology that a
modeler accepts as a supplementary account of reality when using thinging
machines (TMs; i.e. a reality that uncovers the ontology of things that TM
modeling discusses or talks about, akin to the ontology of natural language).
The aim here is aligned toward developing CM notions and processes that are
firm enough. Classical analysis of being per se (e.g. identity, substance) is
de-emphasized in this work; nevertheless, philosophical concepts form an
acknowledged authority to compare to. As a case study, such a methodology is
applied to the notion of information. This application would enhance
understanding of the TM methodology and clarify some of the issues that shed
light on the question of the nature of information as an important concept in
software engineering. Information is defined as about events; that is, it is
about existing things. It is viewed as having a subsisting nature that exists
only through being carried on by other things. The results seem to indicate a
promising approach to define information and understand its nature.},

Abstract      = {The adoption of cloud computing has brought significant advancements in the
operational models of businesses. However, this shift also brings new security
challenges by expanding the attack surface. The offered services in cloud
computing have various service models. Each cloud service model has a defined
responsibility divided based on the stack layers between the service user and
their cloud provider. Regardless of its service model, each service is
constructed from sub-components and services running on the underlying layers.
In this paper, we aim to enable more transparency and visibility by designing
an ontology that links the provider's services with the sub-components used to
deliver the service. Such breakdown for each cloud service sub-components
enables the end user to track the vulnerabilities on the service level or one
of its sub-components. Such information can result in a better understanding
and management of reported vulnerabilities on the sub-components level and
their impact on the offered services by the cloud provider. Our ontology and

Abstract      = {Event forecasting has been a demanding and challenging task throughout the
entire human history. It plays a pivotal role in crisis alarming and disaster
prevention in various aspects of the whole society. The task of event
forecasting aims to model the relational and temporal patterns based on
historical events and makes forecasting to what will happen in the future. Most
existing studies on event forecasting formulate it as a problem of link
prediction on temporal event graphs. However, such pure structured formulation
suffers from two main limitations: 1) most events fall into general and
high-level types in the event ontology, and therefore they tend to be
coarse-grained and offers little utility which inevitably harms the forecasting
accuracy; and 2) the events defined by a fixed ontology are unable to retain
the out-of-ontology contextual information. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel task of context-aware event forecasting which incorporates
auxiliary contextual information. First, the categorical context provides
supplementary fine-grained information to the coarse-grained events. Second and
more importantly, the context provides additional information towards specific
situation and condition, which is crucial or even determinant to what will
happen next. However, it is challenging to properly integrate context into the
event forecasting framework, considering the complex patterns in the
multi-context scenario. Towards this end, we design a novel framework named
Separation and Collaboration Graph Disentanglement (short as SeCoGD) for
context-aware event forecasting. Since there is no available dataset for this
novel task, we construct three large-scale datasets based on GDELT.
Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms a list of SOTA
methods.},

Abstract      = {This paper introduces a new ontology for Materials Science Laboratory
Equipment, termed MSLE. A fundamental issue with materials science laboratory
(hereafter lab) equipment in the real world is that scientists work with
various types of equipment with multiple specifications. For example, there are
many electron microscopes with different parameters in chemical and physical
labs. A critical development to unify the description is to build an equipment
domain ontology as basic semantic knowledge and to guide the user to work with
the equipment appropriately. Here, we propose to develop a consistent ontology
for equipment, the MSLE ontology. In the MSLE, two main existing ontologies,
the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and the Material Vocabulary (MatVoc), have
been integrated into the MSLE core to build a coherent ontology. Since various
acronyms and terms have been used for equipment, this paper proposes an
approach to use a Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) to represent the
hierarchical structure of equipment terms. Equipment terms were collected in
various languages and abbreviations and coded into the MSLE using the SKOS
model. The ontology development was conducted in close collaboration with
domain experts and focused on the large-scale devices for materials
characterization available in our research group. Competency questions are
expected to be addressed through the MSLE ontology. Constraints are modeled in
the Shapes Query Language (SHACL); a prototype is shown and validated to show
the value of the modeling constraints.},

domains. DOLCE is inspired by cognitive and linguistic considerations and aims
to model a commonsense view of reality, like the one human beings exploit in
everyday life in areas as diverse as socio-technical systems, manufacturing,
financial transactions and cultural heritage. DOLCE clearly lists the
ontological choices it is based upon, relies on philosophical principles, is
richly formalized, and is built according to well-established ontological
methodologies, e.g. OntoClean. Because of these features, it has inspired most
of the existing top-level ontologies and has been used to develop or improve
standards and public domain resources (e.g. CIDOC CRM, DBpedia and WordNet).
Being a foundational ontology, DOLCE is not directly concerned with domain
knowledge. Its purpose is to provide the general categories and relations
needed to give a coherent view of reality, to integrate domain knowledge, and
to mediate across domains. In these 20 years DOLCE has shown that applied
ontologies can be stable and that interoperability across reference and domain
ontologies is a reality. This paper briefly introduces the ontology and shows
how to use it on a few modeling cases.},

Abstract      = {Images are loaded with semantic information that pertains to real-world
ontologies: dog breeds share mammalian similarities, food pictures are often
depicted in domestic environments, and so on. However, when training machine
learning models for image classification, the relative similarities amongst
object classes are commonly paired with one-hot-encoded labels. According to
this logic, if an image is labelled as 'spoon', then 'tea-spoon' and 'shark'
are equally wrong in terms of training loss. To overcome this limitation, we
explore the integration of additional goals that reflect ontological and
semantic knowledge, improving model interpretability and trustworthiness. We
suggest a generic approach that allows to derive an additional loss term
starting from any kind of semantic information about the classification label.
First, we show how to apply our approach to ontologies and word embeddings, and
discuss how the resulting information can drive a supervised learning process.
Second, we use our semantically enriched loss to train image classifiers, and
analyse the trade-offs between accuracy, mistake severity, and learned internal
representations. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be further exploited
in terms of explainability and adversarial robustness. Code repository:

capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and
structuring knowledge from natural language text?} To test this hypothesis, we
conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We
evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term
typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations.
Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological
knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical
knowledge in GeoNames, and medical knowledge in UMLS.},

Abstract      = {The field of interpretation of quantum mechanics emerged in an attempt to
solve the measurement problem. This turned on the perception that Niels Bohr
avoided addressing the measurement problem by taking an instrumentalist view of
quantum mechanics. I argue that this view is mistaken and Bohr's interpretation
of quantum mechanics is realist. Moreover, Bohr's interpretation, which is
different from textbook quantum mechanics (which is due more to Von Neumann and
Paul Dirac), succeeds in solving the measurement problem. While the claim that
Bohr dissolves the measurement problem within the limits of the epistemological
framework he assumes has been made by a few authors, rarely has the case been
made that Bohr's project unambiguously and completely overcomes the measurement
problem. I make the strong case that Bohr eliminated the measurement problem
altogether. For this, I put forward two new postulates through which to make
sense of Bohr's interpretation. The article thus seeks to single out Bohr's
interpretation from the various views that go together under the umbrella of
orthodox quantum mechanics, and which have been traditionally considered
susceptible to the measurement problem. It shows that Bohr's interpretation
should be classified along with those like hidden variable theories, collapse
models, modal interpretations etc., which offer a solution to the measurement
problem and are committed to a realist ontology.},

Abstract      = {Automatic protein function prediction (AFP) is classified as a large-scale
multi-label classification problem aimed at automating protein enrichment
analysis to eliminate the current reliance on labor-intensive wet-lab methods.
Currently, popular methods primarily combine protein-related information and
Gene Ontology (GO) terms to generate final functional predictions. For example,
protein sequences, structural information, and protein-protein interaction
networks are integrated as prior knowledge to fuse with GO term embeddings and
generate the ultimate prediction results. However, these methods are limited by
the difficulty in obtaining structural information or network topology
information, as well as the accuracy of such data. Therefore, more and more
methods that only use protein sequences for protein function prediction have
been proposed, which is a more reliable and computationally cheaper approach.
However, the existing methods fail to fully extract feature information from
protein sequences or label data because they do not adequately consider the
intrinsic characteristics of the data itself. Therefore, we propose a
sequence-based hierarchical prediction method, DeepGATGO, which processes
protein sequences and GO term labels hierarchically, and utilizes graph
attention networks (GATs) and contrastive learning for protein function
prediction. Specifically, we compute embeddings of the sequence and label data
using pre-trained models to reduce computational costs and improve the
embedding accuracy. Then, we use GATs to dynamically extract the structural
information of non-Euclidean data, and learn general features of the label
dataset with contrastive learning by constructing positive and negative example
samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model exhibits
better scalability in GO term enrichment analysis on large-scale datasets.},

Abstract      = {Modal logics are widely used in multi-agent systems to reason about actions,
abilities, norms, or epistemic states. Combined with description logic
languages, they are also a powerful tool to formalise modal aspects of
ontology-based reasoning over an object domain. However, the standard
relational semantics for modalities is known to validate principles deemed
problematic in agency, deontic, or epistemic applications. To overcome these
difficulties, weaker systems of so-called non-normal modal logics, equipped
with neighbourhood semantics that generalise the relational one, have been
investigated both at the propositional and at the description logic level. We
present here a family of non-normal modal description logics, obtained by
extending ALC-based languages with non-normal modal operators. For formulas
interpreted on neighbourhood models over varying domains, we provide a modular
framework of terminating, correct, and complete tableau-based satisfiability
checking algorithms in NExpTime. For a subset of these systems, we also
consider a reduction to satisfiability on constant domain relational models.
Moreover, we investigate the satisfiability problem in fragments obtained by
disallowing the application of modal operators to description logic concepts,
providing tight ExpTime complexity results.},

Abstract      = {We look into the ontology of quantum theory as distinct from that of the

are conceptual constructs applying to models generated in the phenomenal world
within limited contexts.The ontology of quantum theory principally rests on the
view that entities in the world are pervasively correlated with one another not
by means of probabilities as in the case of the classical theory, but by means
of probability amplitudes involving finely tuned phases of quantum mechanical
states (entanglement). The quantum correlations are shared globally in the
process of environment-induced decoherence whereby locally generated
correlations are removed, the removal being especially manifest in the case of
systems that appear as classical ones, in which case the process is almost
instantaneous, being, in all likelihood, driven by field fluctuations in the
Planck regime. This points to factors of an unknown nature determining its
finest details, since Planck scale physics remains an obscure terrain. In other
words, the present day quantum theory holds within a limited context set by the
Planck scale.},

Abstract      = {Existential rules form an expressive Datalog-based language to specify
ontological knowledge. The presence of existential quantification in
rule-heads, however, makes the main reasoning tasks undecidable. To overcome
this limitation, in the last two decades, a number of classes of existential
rules guaranteeing the decidability of query answering have been proposed.
Unfortunately, only some of these classes fully encompass Datalog and, often,
this comes at the price of higher computational complexity. Moreover,
expressive classes are typically unable to exploit tools developed for classes
exhibiting lower expressiveness. To mitigate these shortcomings, this paper
introduces a novel general syntactic condition that allows us to define,
systematically and in a uniform way, from any decidable class $\mathcal{C}$ of
existential rules, a new class called Dyadic-$\mathcal{C}$ enjoying the
following properties: $(i)$ it is decidable; $(ii)$ it generalises Datalog;
$(iii)$ it generalises $\mathcal{C}$; $(iv)$ it can effectively exploit any
reasoner for query answering over $\mathcal{C}$; and $(v)$ its computational
complexity does not exceed the highest between the one of $\mathcal{C}$ and the
one of Datalog. Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming

Abstract      = {Recently there has been significant interest in using causal modelling
techniques to understand the structure of physical theories. However, the
notion of `causation' is limiting - insisting that a physical theory must
involve causal structure already places significant constraints on the form
that theory may take. Thus in this paper, we aim to set out a more general
structural framework. We argue that any quantitative physical theory can be
represented in the form of a generative program, i.e. a list of instructions
showing how to generate the empirical data; the information-processing
structure associated with this program can be represented by a directed acyclic
graph (DAG). We suggest that these graphs can be interpreted as encoding
relations of `ontological priority,' and that ontological priority is a
suitable generalisation of causation which applies even to theories that don't
have a natural causal structure. We discuss some applications of our framework
to philosophical questions about realism, operationalism, free will, locality

Abstract      = {Clinical trials are critical for drug development but often suffer from
expensive and inefficient patient recruitment. In recent years, machine
learning models have been proposed for speeding up patient recruitment via
automatically matching patients with clinical trials based on longitudinal

that cannot expand to other trials or perform matching at a very general level
with a black-box model where the lack of interpretability makes the model
results difficult to be adopted.
  To provide accurate and interpretable patient trial matching, we introduce a
personalized dynamic tree-based memory network model named TREEMENT. It
utilizes hierarchical clinical ontologies to expand the personalized patient
representation learned from sequential EHR data, and then uses an attentional
beam-search query learned from eligibility criteria embedding to offer a
granular level of alignment for improved performance and interpretability. We
evaluated TREEMENT against existing models on real-world datasets and
demonstrated that TREEMENT outperforms the best baseline by 7% in terms of
error reduction in criteria-level matching and achieves state-of-the-art

further study on what metadata is shared, and how well it is shared among
databases; 3) promoting an understanding of data sharing and ontologies in the
stakeholder community; 4) improving data sharing and ontologies for specific
phenotypic data types and formats; and 5) lowering specific barriers to data

identification, promotion, or development of data standards. Combined, these

Abstract      = {In order to effectively manage the overwhelming influx of data, it is crucial
to ensure that data is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable
(FAIR). While ontologies and knowledge graphs have been employed to enhance
FAIRness, challenges remain regarding semantic and cognitive interoperability.
We explore how English facilitates reliable communication of terms and
statements, and transfer our findings to a framework of ontologies and
knowledge graphs, while treating terms and statements as minimal information
units. We categorize statement types based on their predicates, recognizing the
limitations of modeling non-binary predicates with multiple triples, which
negatively impacts interoperability. Terms are associated with different frames
of reference, and different operations require different schemata. Term
mappings and schema crosswalks are therefore vital for semantic
interoperability. We propose a machine-actionable Rosetta Stone Framework for
(meta)data, which uses reference terms and schemata as an interlingua to
minimize mappings and crosswalks. Modeling statements rather than a
human-independent reality ensures cognitive familiarity and thus better
interoperability of data structures. We extend this Rosetta modeling paradigm
to reference schemata, resulting in simple schemata with a consistent structure
across statement types, empowering domain experts to create their own schemata
using the Rosetta Editor, without requiring knowledge of semantics. The Editor
also allows specifying textual and graphical display templates for each schema,
delivering human-readable data representations alongside machine-actionable
data structures. The Rosetta Query Builder derives queries based on completed
input forms and the information from corresponding reference schemata. This
work sets the conceptual ground for the Rosetta Stone Framework that we plan to
develop in the future.},

difficulty of identifying and stopping anomalies that may cause disturbances in
the manufacturing process. This paper aims to propose a diffusion-based model
for real-time anomaly prediction in Industry 4.0 processes. Using a
neuro-symbolic approach, we integrate industrial ontologies in the model,
thereby adding formal knowledge on smart manufacturing. Finally, we propose a
simple yet effective way of distilling diffusion models through Random Fourier
Features for deployment on an embedded system for direct integration into the
manufacturing process. To the best of our knowledge, this approach has never
been explored before.},

Abstract      = {Integrating deep learning techniques, particularly language models (LMs),
with knowledge representation techniques like ontologies has raised widespread
attention, urging the need of a platform that supports both paradigms. Although
packages such as OWL API and Jena offer robust support for basic ontology
processing features, they lack the capability to transform various types of
information within ontologies into formats suitable for downstream deep
learning-based applications. Moreover, widely-used ontology APIs are primarily
Java-based while deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow are
mainly for Python programming. To address the needs, we present DeepOnto, a
Python package designed for ontology engineering with deep learning. The
package encompasses a core ontology processing module founded on the
widely-recognised and reliable OWL API, encapsulating its fundamental features
in a more "Pythonic" manner and extending its capabilities to incorporate other
essential components including reasoning, verbalisation, normalisation,
taxonomy, projection, and more. Building on this module, DeepOnto offers a
suite of tools, resources, and algorithms that support various ontology
engineering tasks, such as ontology alignment and completion, by harnessing
deep learning methods, primarily pre-trained LMs. In this paper, we also
demonstrate the practical utility of DeepOnto through two use-cases: the
Digital Health Coaching in Samsung Research UK and the Bio-ML track of the

large-scale relational data for many real-world applications. Existing methods

high-level ontology-view concepts and fine-grained instance-view entities. They
usually embed all nodes as vectors in one latent space. However, a single
geometric representation fails to capture the structural differences between
two views and lacks probabilistic semantics towards concepts' granularity. We
propose Concept2Box, a novel approach that jointly embeds the two views of a KG
using dual geometric representations. We model concepts with box embeddings,
which learn the hierarchy structure and complex relations such as overlap and
disjoint among them. Box volumes can be interpreted as concepts' granularity.
Different from concepts, we model entities as vectors. To bridge the gap
between concept box embeddings and entity vector embeddings, we propose a novel
vector-to-box distance metric and learn both embeddings jointly. Experiments on
both the public DBpedia KG and a newly-created industrial KG showed the
effectiveness of Concept2Box.},

is real. As a consequence, the following three results were obtained: (1)
causation can be understood via the notion of systemic function; (2) any cause
can be decomposed using only four subfunctions, namely Achieves, Prevents,
Allows, and Disallows; and (3) the last three subfunctions can be defined in
terms of Achieves alone. It follows that the essence of causation lies in a
single function, namely Achieves. It remains to elucidate the nature of the
Achieves function, which has been elaborated only partially in the previous
work. In this paper, we first discuss a couple of underlying policies in the
above-mentioned causal theory since these are useful in the discussion, then
summarize the results obtained in the former paper, and finally reveal the
nature of Achieves giving a complete solution to the problem of what causation
is.},

based on contextualized word representations -- which allows to enrich
universal-dependency trees with dependency arcs denoting arguments of deverbal
nouns, using the same labels as the corresponding verbal cases. By sharing the
same label set as in the verbal case, patterns that were developed for verbs

Abstract      = {Conceptual models as representations of real-world systems are based on
diverse techniques in various disciplines but lack a framework that provides
multidisciplinary ontological understanding of real-world phenomena.
Concurrently, systems complexity has intensified, leading to a rise in
developing models using different formalisms and diverse representations even
within a single domain. Conceptual models have become larger; languages tend to
acquire more features, and it is not unusual to use different modeling
languages for different components. This diversity has caused problems with
consistency between models and incompatibly with designed systems. Two main
solutions have been adopted over the last few years: (1) A currently dominant
technology-based solution tries to harmonize or unify models, e.g., unifies EER
and UML. This solution would solidify modeling achievements, reaping benefits
from huge investments over the last thirty years. (2) A less prevalent solution
is to pursuit deeper roots that reveal unifying modeling principles and
apparatuses. An example of the second method is a category theory-based
approach that utilizes the strengths of the graph and set theory, along with
other topological tools. This manuscript is a sequel in a research venture that
belongs to the second approach and uses a model called thinging machines (TMs)
founded on Stoic ontology and Lupascian logic. TM modeling contests the thesis
that there is no universal approach that covers all aspects of an application,
and the paper demonstrates that pursuing such universality is anything but a
dead-end method. This paper continues in this direction, with emphasis on TM
foundation (e.g., existence and subsistence of things) and exemplifies this
pursuit by proposing an alternative representation of set theory.},

Abstract      = {This paper explores new frontiers in agricultural natural language processing
by investigating the effectiveness of using food-related text corpora for
pretraining transformer-based language models. In particular, we focus on the
task of semantic matching, which involves establishing mappings between food
descriptions and nutrition data. To accomplish this, we fine-tune a pre-trained
transformer-based language model, AgriBERT, on this task, utilizing an external
source of knowledge, such as the FoodOn ontology. To advance the field of
agricultural NLP, we propose two new avenues of exploration: (1) utilizing
GPT-based models as a baseline and (2) leveraging ChatGPT as an external source
of knowledge. ChatGPT has shown to be a strong baseline in many NLP tasks, and
we believe it has the potential to improve our model in the task of semantic
matching and enhance our model's understanding of food-related concepts and
relationships. Additionally, we experiment with other applications, such as
cuisine prediction based on food ingredients, and expand the scope of our
research to include other NLP tasks beyond semantic matching. Overall, this
paper provides promising avenues for future research in this field, with
potential implications for improving the performance of agricultural NLP
applications.},

go hand in hand with domain orientation, that is, the specialization of an LLM

are usually fine-tuned over publicly available data or, at most, over ground
data from databases, ignoring business-level definitions and domain experience.
On the other hand, Enterprise Knowledge Graphs (EKGs) are able to capture and
augment such domain knowledge via ontological reasoning. With the goal of
combining LLM flexibility with the domain orientation of EKGs, we propose a
novel neurosymbolic architecture that leverages the power of ontological

Abstract      = {Clinical decision-making is a fundamental stage in delivering appropriate
care to patients. In recent years several decision-making systems designed to
aid the clinician in this process have been developed. However, technical
solutions currently in use are based on simple regression models and are only
able to take into account simple pre-defined multiple-choice features, such as
patient age, pre-existing conditions, smoker status, etc. One particular source
of patient data, that available decision-making systems are incapable of
processing is the collection of patient consultation GP notes. These contain
crucial signs and symptoms - the information used by clinicians in order to
make a final decision and direct the patient to the appropriate care.
Extracting information from GP notes is a technically challenging problem, as
they tend to include abbreviations, typos, and incomplete sentences.
  This paper addresses this open challenge. We present a framework that
performs knowledge graph construction from raw GP medical notes written during
or after patient consultations. By relying on support phrases mined from the
SNOMED ontology, as well as predefined supported facts from values used in the
RECAP (REmote COVID-19 Assessment in Primary Care) patient risk prediction
tool, our graph generative framework is able to extract structured knowledge
graphs from the highly unstructured and inconsistent format that consultation
notes are written in. Our knowledge graphs include information about existing
patient symptoms, their duration, and their severity.
  We apply our framework to consultation notes of COVID-19 patients in the UK
COVID-19 Clinical Assesment Servcie (CCAS) patient dataset. We provide a
quantitative evaluation of the performance of our framework, demonstrating that
our approach has better accuracy than traditional NLP methods when answering
questions about patients.},

replaced by a completely ontological set, which means that, here, quantum
mechanics does not deviate from a purely geometric, ontological particle
system. The effects of the mass terms are included. Locality holds for the
quantum theory, and seems to be fully obeyed also by the classical treatment,
although further discussion will be needed. Quantised interactions are briefly
speculated on, but mostly postponed to later. We do discuss extensively the
distinction between the quantum treatment and the classical one, even though
they produce exactly the same equations mathematically. We briefly explain how
this result can be squared with the usual quantum no-go theorems. It is
suggested to apply this theory for real time quantum model simulations.},

organized in a four-level ontology. Experiments on a set of broadly adopted
VDER tasks show significant improvements when DocumentNet is incorporated into
the pre-training for both classic and few-shot learning settings. With the

carefully examined the correlation of the automatic scores with the human

Eprint        = {2306.00665v1},
ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Background: More than 400,000 biomedical concepts and some of their
relationships are contained in SnomedCT, a comprehensive biomedical ontology.
However, their concept names are not always readily interpretable by
non-experts, or patients looking at their own electronic health records (EHR).
Clear definitions or descriptions in understandable language are often not
available. Therefore, generating human-readable definitions for biomedical
concepts might help make the information they encode more accessible and
understandable to a wider public.
  Objective: In this article, we introduce the Automatic Glossary of Clinical
Terminology (AGCT), a large-scale biomedical dictionary of clinical concepts
generated using high-quality information extracted from the biomedical
knowledge contained in SnomedCT.
  Methods: We generate a novel definition for every SnomedCT concept, after
prompting the OpenAI Turbo model, a variant of GPT 3.5, using a high-quality
verbalization of the SnomedCT relationships of the to-be-defined concept. A
significant subset of the generated definitions was subsequently judged by NLP
researchers with biomedical expertise on 5-point scales along the following
three axes: factuality, insight, and fluency.
  Results: AGCT contains 422,070 computer-generated definitions for SnomedCT
concepts, covering various domains such as diseases, procedures, drugs, and
anatomy. The average length of the definitions is 49 words. The definitions
were assigned average scores of over 4.5 out of 5 on all three axes, indicating
a majority of factual, insightful, and fluent definitions.
  Conclusion: AGCT is a novel and valuable resource for biomedical tasks that
require human-readable definitions for SnomedCT concepts. It can also serve as
a base for developing robust biomedical retrieval models or other applications
that leverage natural language understanding of biomedical knowledge.},

Abstract      = {Due to the increasing adoption of electronic health records (EHR), large
scale EHRs have become another rich data source for translational clinical
research. Despite its potential, deriving generalizable knowledge from EHR data
remains challenging. First, EHR data are generated as part of clinical care
with data elements too detailed and fragmented for research. Despite recent
progress in mapping EHR data to common ontology with hierarchical structures,
much development is still needed to enable automatic grouping of local EHR
codes to meaningful clinical concepts at a large scale. Second, the total
number of unique EHR features is large, imposing methodological challenges to
derive reproducible knowledge graph, especially when interest lies in
conditional dependency structure. Third, the detailed EHR data on a very large
patient cohort imposes additional computational challenge to deriving a
knowledge network. To overcome these challenges, we propose to infer the
conditional dependency structure among EHR features via a latent graphical
block model (LGBM). The LGBM has a two layer structure with the first providing
semantic embedding vector (SEV) representation for the EHR features and the
second overlaying a graphical block model on the latent SEVs. The block
structures on the graphical model also allows us to cluster synonymous features
in EHR. We propose to learn the LGBM efficiently, in both statistical and
computational sense, based on the empirical point mutual information matrix. We
establish the statistical rates of the proposed estimators and show the perfect
recovery of the block structure. Numerical results from simulation studies and
real EHR data analyses suggest that the proposed LGBM estimator performs well
in finite sample.},

Abstract      = {Classical planning representation languages based on first-order logic have
preliminarily been used to model and solve robotic task planning problems.
Wider adoption of these representation languages, however, is hindered by the
limitations present when managing implicit world changes with concise action
models. To address this problem, we propose an alternative approach to
representing and managing updates to world states during planning. Based on the
category-theoretic concepts of $\mathsf{C}$-sets and double-pushout rewriting
(DPO), our proposed representation can effectively handle structured knowledge
about world states that support domain abstractions at all levels. It
formalizes the semantics of predicates according to a user-provided ontology
and preserves the semantics when transitioning between world states. This
method provides a formal semantics for using knowledge graphs and relational
databases to model world states and updates in planning. In this paper, we
conceptually compare our category-theoretic representation with the classical
planning representation. We show that our proposed representation has
advantages over the classical representation in terms of handling implicit
preconditions and effects, and provides a more structured framework in which to
model and solve planning problems.},

introducing a novel architecture adjusted to the humanitarian analysis

HumBert, and (3) proposing a systematic way to measure and mitigate biases. Our
experiments' results show the better performance of our approach on zero-shot

also revealing the existence of biases in the resulting LLMs. Utilizing a

Abstract      = {We consider the problem of Open-world Information Extraction (Open-world IE),

large language model (LLM) that is able to perform Open-world IE to extract
desirable entity profiles characterized by (possibly fine-grained) natural

tuning. In particular, we construct INSTRUCTOPENWIKI, a substantial instruction
tuning dataset for Open-world IE enriched with a comprehensive corpus,
extensive annotations, and diverse instructions. We finetune the pretrained
BLOOM models on INSTRUCTOPENWIKI and obtain PIVOINE, an LLM for Open-world IE
with strong instruction-following capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate
that PIVOINE significantly outperforms traditional closed-world methods and
other LLM baselines, displaying impressive generalization capabilities on both
unseen instructions and out-of-ontology cases. Consequently, PIVOINE emerges as
a promising solution to tackle the open-world challenge in IE effectively.},

impart autonomous agents with similar capabilities. Recent works take a step
towards this goal by creating a semantic spatial map representation of the

limited for practical applicability as they do not distinguish between
different instances of the same object. In this work, we address this
limitation by integrating instance-level information into spatial map
representation using a community detection algorithm and utilizing word
ontology learned by large language models (LLMs) to perform open-set semantic
associations in the mapping representation. The resulting map representation
improves the navigation performance by two-fold (233%) on realistic language

ArchivePrefix = {arXiv},
PrimaryClass  = {q-bio.GN},
Abstract      = {Molecular biologists frequently interpret gene lists derived from
high-throughput experiments and computational analysis. This is typically done
as a statistical enrichment analysis that measures the over- or
under-representation of biological function terms associated with genes or
their properties, based on curated assertions from a knowledge base (KB) such
as the Gene Ontology (GO). Interpreting gene lists can also be framed as a
textual summarization task, enabling the use of Large Language Models (LLMs),
potentially utilizing scientific texts directly and avoiding reliance on a KB.
  We developed SPINDOCTOR (Structured Prompt Interpolation of Natural Language
Descriptions of Controlled Terms for Ontology Reporting), a method that uses
GPT models to perform gene set function summarization as a complement to
standard enrichment analysis. This method can use different sources of gene
functional information: (1) structured text derived from curated ontological KB
annotations, (2) ontology-free narrative gene summaries, or (3) direct model
retrieval.
  We demonstrate that these methods are able to generate plausible and
biologically valid summary GO term lists for gene sets. However, GPT-based
approaches are unable to deliver reliable scores or p-values and often return
terms that are not statistically significant. Crucially, these methods were
rarely able to recapitulate the most precise and informative term from standard
enrichment, likely due to an inability to generalize and reason using an
ontology. Results are highly nondeterministic, with minor variations in prompt
resulting in radically different term lists. Our results show that at this
point, LLM-based methods are unsuitable as a replacement for standard term
enrichment analysis and that manual curation of ontological assertions remains
necessary.},

Abstract      = {Fine-grained entity typing (FET), which assigns entities in text with
context-sensitive, fine-grained semantic types, is a basic but important task
for knowledge extraction from unstructured text. FET has been studied
extensively in natural language processing and typically relies on
human-annotated corpora for training, which is costly and difficult to scale.
Recent studies explore the utilization of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as
a knowledge base to generate rich and context-aware weak supervision for FET.
However, a PLM still requires direction and guidance to serve as a knowledge
base as they often generate a mixture of rough and fine-grained types, or
tokens unsuitable for typing. In this study, we vision that an ontology
provides a semantics-rich, hierarchical structure, which will help select the
best results generated by multiple PLM models and head words. Specifically, we
propose a novel annotation-free, ontology-guided FET method, OntoType, which
follows a type ontological structure, from coarse to fine, ensembles multiple
PLM prompting results to generate a set of type candidates, and refines its
type resolution, under the local context with a natural language inference
model. Our experiments on the Ontonotes, FIGER, and NYT datasets using their
associated ontological structures demonstrate that our method outperforms the
state-of-the-art zero-shot fine-grained entity typing methods as well as a

Abstract      = {Online social media platforms, such as Twitter, are one of the most valuable
sources of information during disaster events. Therefore, humanitarian
organizations, government agencies, and volunteers rely on a summary of this
information, i.e., tweets, for effective disaster management. Although there
are several existing supervised and unsupervised approaches for automated tweet
summary approaches, these approaches either require extensive labeled
information or do not incorporate specific domain knowledge of disasters.
Additionally, the most recent approaches to disaster summarization have
proposed BERT-based models to enhance the summary quality. However, for further
improved performance, we introduce the utilization of domain-specific knowledge
without any human efforts to understand the importance (salience) of a tweet
which further aids in summary creation and improves summary quality. In this
paper, we propose a disaster-specific tweet summarization framework, IKDSumm,
which initially identifies the crucial and important information from each
tweet related to a disaster through key-phrases of that tweet. We identify
these key-phrases by utilizing the domain knowledge (using existing ontology)
of disasters without any human intervention. Further, we utilize these
key-phrases to automatically generate a summary of the tweets. Therefore, given
tweets related to a disaster, IKDSumm ensures fulfillment of the summarization
key objectives, such as information coverage, relevance, and diversity in
summary without any human intervention. We evaluate the performance of IKDSumm
with 8 state-of-the-art techniques on 12 disaster datasets. The evaluation
results show that IKDSumm outperforms existing techniques by approximately
2-79% in terms of ROUGE-N F1-score.},

Abstract      = {The current state-of-the-art Diffusion model has demonstrated excellent

the result of the distribution of images of people in the training set, making
it challenging to generate multiple images for a fixed number of individuals.
This problem can often only be solved by fine-tuning the training of the model.
This means that each individual/animated character image must be trained if it
is to be drawn, and the hardware and cost of this training is often beyond the
reach of the average user, who accounts for the largest number of people. To
solve this problem, the Character Image Feature Encoder model proposed in this
paper enables the user to use the process by simply providing a picture of the
character to make the image of the character in the generated image match the
expectation. In addition, various details can be adjusted during the process
using prompts. Unlike traditional Image-to-Image models, the Character Image
Feature Encoder extracts only the relevant image features, rather than
information about the model's composition or movements. In addition, the
Character Image Feature Encoder can be adapted to different models after
training. The proposed model can be conveniently incorporated into the Stable

Abstract      = {Learning vectors that capture the meaning of concepts remains a fundamental
challenge. Somewhat surprisingly, perhaps, pre-trained language models have
thus far only enabled modest improvements to the quality of such concept
embeddings. Current strategies for using language models typically represent a
concept by averaging the contextualised representations of its mentions in some
corpus. This is potentially sub-optimal for at least two reasons. First,
contextualised word vectors have an unusual geometry, which hampers downstream
tasks. Second, concept embeddings should capture the semantic properties of
concepts, whereas contextualised word vectors are also affected by other
factors. To address these issues, we propose two contrastive learning
strategies, based on the view that whenever two sentences reveal similar
properties, the corresponding contextualised vectors should also be similar.
One strategy is fully unsupervised, estimating the properties which are
expressed in a sentence from the neighbourhood structure of the contextualised
word embeddings. The second strategy instead relies on a distant supervision
signal from ConceptNet. Our experimental results show that the resulting
vectors substantially outperform existing concept embeddings in predicting the
semantic properties of concepts, with the ConceptNet-based strategy achieving
the best results. These findings are furthermore confirmed in a clustering task
and in the downstream task of ontology completion.},

Abstract      = {Event detection (ED) is aimed to identify the key trigger words in

models are too data-hungry to accommodate real applications with scarce labeled

Therefore, we focus on the true few-shot paradigm to satisfy the low-resource
scenarios. In particular, we propose a multi-step prompt learning model
(MsPrompt) for debiasing few-shot event detection, that consists of the
following three components: an under-sampling module targeting to construct a
novel training set that accommodates the true few-shot setting, a multi-step
prompt module equipped with a knowledge-enhanced ontology to leverage the event
semantics and latent prior knowledge in the PLMs sufficiently for tackling the
context-bypassing problem, and a prototypical module compensating for the
weakness of classifying events with sparse data and boost the generalization
performance. Experiments on two public datasets ACE-2005 and FewEvent show that
MsPrompt can outperform the state-of-the-art models, especially in the strict
low-resource scenarios reporting 11.43% improvement in terms of weighted

task due to its applications in predicting missing facts and knowledge-enhanced
learning in fields such as bioinformatics. The underlying semantics of OWL
ontologies are expressed using Description Logics (DLs). Initial approaches to
generate embeddings relied on constructing a graph out of ontologies,
neglecting the semantics of the logic therein. Recent semantic-preserving
embedding methods often target lightweight DL languages like
$\mathcal{EL}^{++}$, ignoring more expressive information in ontologies.
Although some approaches aim to embed more descriptive DLs like
$\mathcal{ALC}$, those methods require the existence of individuals, while many
real-world ontologies are devoid of them. We propose an ontology embedding
method for the $\mathcal{ALC}$ DL language that considers the lattice structure
of concept descriptions. We use connections between DL and Category Theory to
materialize the lattice structure and embed it using an order-preserving
embedding method. We show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in several knowledge base completion tasks. Furthermore, we incoporate
saturation procedures that increase the information within the constructed
lattices. We make our code and data available at

Abstract      = {Universal source separation (USS) is a fundamental research task for
computational auditory scene analysis, which aims to separate mono recordings
into individual source tracks. There are three potential challenges awaiting
the solution to the audio source separation task. First, previous audio source
separation systems mainly focus on separating one or a limited number of
specific sources. There is a lack of research on building a unified system that
can separate arbitrary sources via a single model. Second, most previous
systems require clean source data to train a separator, while clean source data
are scarce. Third, there is a lack of USS system that can automatically detect
and separate active sound classes in a hierarchical level. To use large-scale
weakly labeled/unlabeled audio data for audio source separation, we propose a
universal audio source separation framework containing: 1) an audio tagging
model trained on weakly labeled data as a query net; and 2) a conditional
source separation model that takes query net outputs as conditions to separate
arbitrary sound sources. We investigate various query nets, source separation
models, and training strategies and propose a hierarchical USS strategy to
automatically detect and separate sound classes from the AudioSet ontology. By
solely leveraging the weakly labelled AudioSet, our USS system is successful in
separating a wide variety of sound classes, including sound event separation,
music source separation, and speech enhancement. The USS system achieves an
average signal-to-distortion ratio improvement (SDRi) of 5.57 dB over 527 sound
classes of AudioSet; 10.57 dB on the DCASE 2018 Task 2 dataset; 8.12 dB on the
MUSDB18 dataset; an SDRi of 7.28 dB on the Slakh2100 dataset; and an SSNR of
9.00 dB on the voicebank-demand dataset. We release the source code at

Abstract      = {This paper shines a light on the potential of definition-based semantic
models for detecting idiomatic and semi-idiomatic multiword expressions (MWEs)
in clinical terminology. Our study focuses on biomedical entities defined in
the UMLS ontology and aims to help prioritize the translation efforts of these
entities. In particular, we develop an effective tool for scoring the
idiomaticity of biomedical MWEs based on the degree of similarity between the
semantic representations of those MWEs and a weighted average of the
representation of their constituents. We achieve this using a biomedical
language model trained to produce similar representations for entity names and
their definitions, called BioLORD. The importance of this definition-based
approach is highlighted by comparing the BioLORD model to two other
state-of-the-art biomedical language models based on Transformer: SapBERT and
CODER. Our results show that the BioLORD model has a strong ability to identify
idiomatic MWEs, not replicated in other models. Our corpus-free idiomaticity
estimation helps ontology translators to focus on more challenging MWEs.},

  An Application in Healthcare},
Eprint        = {2305.05640v3},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.AI},
Abstract      = {Knowledge graphs (KGs) are a popular way to organise information based on
ontologies or schemas and have been used across a variety of scenarios from
search to recommendation. Despite advances in KGs, representing knowledge
remains a non-trivial task across industries and it is especially challenging
in the biomedical and healthcare domains due to complex interdependent
relations between entities, heterogeneity, lack of standardization, and
sparseness of data. KGs are used to discover diagnoses or prioritize genes
relevant to disease, but they often rely on schemas that are not centred around
a node or entity of interest, such as a person. Entity-centric KGs are
relatively unexplored but hold promise in representing important facets
connected to a central node and unlocking downstream tasks beyond graph
traversal and reasoning, such as generating graph embeddings and training graph
neural networks for a wide range of predictive tasks. This paper presents an
end-to-end representation learning framework to extract entity-centric KGs from
structured and unstructured data. We introduce a star-shaped ontology to
represent the multiple facets of a person and use it to guide KG creation.
Compact representations of the graphs are created leveraging graph neural
networks and experiments are conducted using different levels of heterogeneity
or explicitness. A readmission prediction task is used to evaluate the results
of the proposed framework, showing a stable system, robust to missing data,
that outperforms a range of baseline machine learning classifiers. We highlight
that this approach has several potential applications across domains and is
open-sourced. Lastly, we discuss lessons learned, challenges, and next steps
for the adoption of the framework in practice.},

Abstract      = {We develop computational models to analyze court statements in order to
assess judicial attitudes toward victims of sexual violence in the Israeli
court system. The study examines the resonance of "rape myths" in the criminal
justice system's response to sex crimes, in particular in judicial assessment
of victim's credibility. We begin by formulating an ontology for evaluating
judicial attitudes toward victim's credibility, with eight ordinal labels and
binary categorizations. Second, we curate a manually annotated dataset for
judicial assessments of victim's credibility in the Hebrew language, as well as
a model that can extract credibility labels from court cases. The dataset
consists of 855 verdict decision documents in sexual assault cases from
1990-2021, annotated with the help of legal experts and trained law students.
The model uses a combined approach of syntactic and latent structures to find
sentences that convey the judge's attitude towards the victim and classify them
according to the credibility label set. Our ontology, data, and models will be
made available upon request, in the hope they spur future progress in this
judicial important task.},

Abstract      = {Ontologies play a critical role in Semantic Web technologies by providing a
structured and standardized way to represent knowledge and enabling machines to
understand the meaning of data. Several taxonomies and ontologies have been
generated, but individuals target one domain, and only some of those have been
found expensive in time and manual effort. Also, they need more coverage of
unconventional topics representing a more holistic and comprehensive view of
the knowledge landscape and interdisciplinary collaborations. Thus, there needs
to be an ontology covering Science and Technology and facilitate
multidisciplinary research by connecting topics from different fields and
domains that may be related or have commonalities. To address these issues, we
present an automatic Science and Technology Ontology (S&TO) that covers
unconventional topics in different science and technology domains. The proposed
S&TO can promote the discovery of new research areas and collaborations across
disciplines. The ontology is constructed by applying BERTopic to a dataset of
393,991 scientific articles collected from Semantic Scholar from October 2021
to August 2022, covering four fields of science. Currently, S&TO includes 5,153
topics and 13,155 semantic relations. S&TO model can be updated by running
BERTopic on more recent datasets},

PrimaryClass  = {cs.CL},
Abstract      = {Existing task-oriented conversational search systems heavily rely on domain
ontologies with pre-defined slots and candidate value sets. In practical
applications, these prerequisites are hard to meet, due to the emerging new
user requirements and ever-changing scenarios. To mitigate these issues for
better interaction performance, there are efforts working towards detecting
out-of-vocabulary values or discovering new slots under unsupervised or
semi-supervised learning paradigm. However, overemphasizing on the conversation
data patterns alone induces these methods to yield noisy and arbitrary slot
results. To facilitate the pragmatic utility, real-world systems tend to
provide a stringent amount of human labelling quota, which offers an
authoritative way to obtain accurate and meaningful slot assignments.
Nonetheless, it also brings forward the high requirement of utilizing such
quota efficiently. Hence, we formulate a general new slot discovery task in an
information extraction fashion and incorporate it into an active learning
framework to realize human-in-the-loop learning. Specifically, we leverage
existing language tools to extract value candidates where the corresponding
labels are further leveraged as weak supervision signals. Based on these, we
propose a bi-criteria selection scheme which incorporates two major strategies,
namely, uncertainty-based sampling and diversity-based sampling to efficiently
identify terms of interest. We conduct extensive experiments on several public
datasets and compare with a bunch of competitive baselines to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method. We have made the code and data used in this paper

expertise. In this work we propose OpenFSP, a framework that allows for easy
creation of new domains from a handful of simple labels that can be generated
without specific NLP knowledge. Our approach relies on creating a small, but
expressive, set of domain agnostic slot types that enables easy annotation of
new domains. Given such annotation, a matching algorithm relying on sentence
encoders predicts the intent and slots for domains defined by end-users.
Extensive experiments on the TopV2 dataset shows that our model outperforms
strong baselines in this simple labels setting.},
