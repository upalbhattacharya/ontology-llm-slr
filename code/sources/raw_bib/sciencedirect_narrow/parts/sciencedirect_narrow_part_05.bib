abstract = {As an indispensable component of the emerging 6G networks, Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks (SAGINs) are envisioned to provide ubiquitous network connectivity and services by integrating satellite networks, aerial networks, and terrestrial networks. In 6G SAGINs, a wide variety of network services with the features of diverse requirements, complex mobility, and multi-dimensional resources will pose great challenges to service provisioning, which urges the development of service-oriented SAGINs. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive review of 6G SAGINs from a new perspective of service-oriented network. First, we present the requirements of service-oriented networks, and then propose a service-oriented SAGINs management architecture. Two categories of critical technologies are presented and discussed, i.e., heterogeneous resource orchestration technologies and the cloud-edge synergy technologies, which facilitate the interoperability of different network segments and cooperatively orchestrate heterogeneous resources across different domains, according to the service features and requirements. In addition, the potential future research directions are also presented and discussed.}

abstract = {Growth of urban population around the world and, particularly, within urban areas, has placed various pressing challenges on Food, Energy, and Water (FEW) such as food security, water safety as well as energy scarcity and so on. Current studies on urban FEW nexus are mainly focused on the correlation analysis of elements by pairs, while these works are developed separately. With respect to the methods, the existing researches mostly adopt the bottom-up approach, accounting for the direct relationship between the individual production sectors. While the associations between the internal elements of the system still lack of simulation. In this study, we aim at developing an online open access tool for cities, the Urban Circular Economy Calculator (UCEC), which enables to develop different circular economy scenarios associated to FEW management. UCEC v1.0 uses Beijing data as test case. In particular, more than 20 circular economy policies related on food, energy and water are selected and divided into 6 categories. Long-term simulations on the social, economic and environmental impacts are provided to test the trajectories of policy effects. Being an open access tool, UCEC can be used also for supporting participatory processes as an urban management instrument. The solution is economically and financially feasible, due to the low level of technical requirements. The necessity of such a tool is proved by the societal need of transition toward a low-carbon and sustainable framework, which can be effectively supported by the introduction of circular economy. This transition, such as the idea behind UCEC, should preserve (or even improve) the societal wellbeing, while increasing basic resources (i.e.: FEW) accessibility, security and preservation.}

We have carried out a statistical study on ontology reuse in the ontologies collected in Linked Open Vocabularies (LOV), in addition to a particular analysis of a use case. The results of the present work show that, when building an ontology, the heterogeneity between the needed conceptualization and that of available ontologies, as well as the deficiencies in some of such ontologies (concerning documentation, licensing, etc.) are important obstacles for reusing ontologies of the same domain of the ontology under development. A possible approach to lessen these problems could be the creation of communities similar to open software ones in charge of developing and maintaining ontologies.}

Information exchange among stakeholders is essential to enable energy sharing among buildings that form a NetZECs. However, traditional, centralised energy management usually places emphasis on the supply side and does not address data exchange among individual stakeholders. This paper proposes an information sharing strategy based on linked data for improved management of NetZEBs and NetZECs. This strategy systematically integrates stakeholders' engagement by using energy performance indicators as information carriers and linked data as engagement channels. A case study proves the advantages of the developed strategy for improving the energy balance at individual building level, building cluster level, and community level. It is found that the strategy could help achieve NetZEBs and NetZECs through empowering stakeholders' interaction and information sharing.}

Development of most annotation tools strongly focuses on providing novel functionality — end-user evaluations of interface and user interaction are rare. This article reports on the results of a series of user studies executed to explore how non-expert users understand the process of enriching texts with semantic annotations. We find that these users can easily create simple semantic annotations (e.g., assigning concepts to text passages) but have difficulties understanding complex semantic annotations (e.g., assigning semantic identifiers to text passages). We present the results of three user studies on manual semantic annotation and discusses the lessons learned about both the semantic enrichment process and our methodology of exposing non-experts to semantic enrichment.}

abstract = {The efficient processing of mass stream data has attracted wide attention in the database field. The skyline query on the sensor data stream can monitor multiple targets in real time, to avoid abnormal events such as fire and explosion, which is very useful in the practical application of sensor data monitoring. However, real-world stream data may often contain incomplete data attributes due to faulty sensing devices or imperfect data collection techniques. Skyline queries over incomplete data streams may lead to a lack of transitivity and loop domination issues. To solve the problem of the skyline query over incomplete data streams, firstly, this paper uses differential dependency rule (DD) to fill the missing attribute values of data in the incomplete data stream. Then, the hierarchical grid index (HGrid) is introduced into the field of skyline query to improve pruning efficiency. In the process of skyline calculation, this paper only keeps as few calculation results as possible for the data that may affect the result to avoid a large number of repeated calculations. Thus, S_IDS (Skyline query algorithm over Incomplete Data Stream) is proposed to query skyline results with high confidence from the incomplete data stream. Finally, by comparing with the most advanced skyline query algorithms over incomplete data streams, the correctness and efficiency of the proposed S_IDS algorithm are proved.}

Visual Analytics facilitates the understanding of the domain and tasks represented by ontologies, thus allowing to carry out exploratory analysis to optimize the comprehension of data semantics including non-explicit relationships between data. Through the DoI technique, we place the main concept in focus, distinguishing it from the unnecessary information and facilitating the analysis and understanding of correlated data. We evaluated all the devised solutions, and the results reinforce the importance of providing visualization and analysis techniques dedicated to the schema and instances levels of ontologies for the discovery of non-explicit information.}

This article addresses the challenge of improving efficiency and quality of operational production assets information management in industry customer company interaction with their production equipment vendors, with a design science research approach. The research was executed in collaboration between research organizations, forest industry companies, industrial production equipment vendors and information technology (IT) companies on two parallel and complementary research tracks, which are described with their key research results. The contributions are an ex-ante evaluated digital marketplace concept with preliminary requirements, and an ex-post evaluated semi-automated master data harmonization tool, as artefacts for improving efficiency and quality of production assets information management in industrial customer–vendors interaction. As theoretical contribution, the article provides a synthesis of the research results in the framework of information systems (IS) design theory as a nascent and novel design theory on designing IS artifacts for improving efficiency and quality of production assets information management, both in single industrial customer company and ecosystem settings. The contributions provide a starting point for further research and development of a digital marketplace for improving production assets information management in industrial customers – vendors interaction, potentially also applicable for similar ecosystems in other continuous production process -based manufacturing industries.}

In this paper, we introduce FLAGS, the Fused-AI interpretabLe Anomaly Generation System, and combine both techniques in one methodology to overcome their limitations and optimize them based on limited user feedback. Semantic knowledge is incorporated in a machine learning technique to enhance expressivity. At the same time, feedback about the faults and anomalies that occurred is provided as input to increase adaptiveness using semantic rule mining methods. This new methodology is evaluated on a predictive maintenance case for trains. We show that our method reduces their downtime and provides more insight into frequently occurring problems.}

(2009) adopt broader similarity definition, involving also hyponymy and antonymy relations. Paradigmatic association covers synonymy, antonymy and co-hyponymy relations (Lapesa et al., 2014) largely overlapping with this broader similarity definition. Two words are paradigmatically associated if they can replace one another without affecting the grammaticality or acceptability of the sentence. Paradigmatic association can be elicited by asking for word interchangeability, which we hypothesize might be more natural than instructing raters with a list of relations to consider. To validate the proposed approach, we reannotated WordSim353 and SimLex-999 using two new guidelines: one explicitly qualifying antonymy as a similarity relation, the second one eliciting word interchangeability. As additional datasets we present a crowdsourced version of WordSim353 and a Czech version of SimLex-999. The paper also includes detailed analysis of lexical content of SimLex-999 and benchmark of thesaurus-based and distributional algorithms on multiple word similarity and relatedness datasets.}

By reusing the National Center for Biomedical Ontologies (NCBO) BioPortal technology, we have designed AgroPortal, an ontology repository for the agronomy domain. The AgroPortal project re-uses the biomedical domain’s semantic tools and insights to serve agronomy, but also food, plant, and biodiversity sciences. We offer a portal that features ontology hosting, search, versioning, visualization, comment, and recommendation; enables semantic annotation; stores and exploits ontology alignments; and enables interoperation with the semantic web. The AgroPortal specifically satisfies requirements of the agronomy community in terms of ontology formats (e.g., SKOS vocabularies and trait dictionaries) and supported features (offering detailed metadata and advanced annotation capabilities). In this paper, we present our platform’s content and features, including the additions to the original technology, as well as preliminary outputs of five driving agronomic use cases that participated in the design and orientation of the project to anchor it in the community. By building on the experience and existing technology acquired from the biomedical domain, we can present in AgroPortal a robust and feature-rich repository of great value for the agronomic domain.}

Though several techniques exist for opinion mining based on decision making in this paper the approach is novel. In this paper the approach used is in addition to the opinions generated from the reviews collected from E-Commerce websites and calculating the overall sentiment for decision making, this paper also incorporates a priority for particular features of a product entered by the buyer for making the final decision. This has been incorporated in the form of additional weights which can be entered by the user and adjusted according to the priority. The reason to do this is that priority for a particular feature of a product may vary from person to person. Moreover, the final decision lay in the buyer’s hand in addition to the opinions collected and analysed from reviews.}

In particular, we consider (i) the extent to which countries specialise in AI and are relevant markets for corresponding IP protection (‘National Breeding Ground’); and (ii) the extent to which countries attract AI from abroad for IP protection and extend the protection of their AI-related IP to foreign markets (‘International Breeding Ground’). Our investigation confirms prior findings regarding substantial changes in the technological leadership in AI, besides drastic changes in the relevance of AI techniques over time. Particularly, we find that National and International Breeding Grounds overlap only partially. China and the US can be characterised as dominant National Breeding Grounds. Australia and selected European countries, but primarily the US, are major International Breeding Grounds. We conclude that China promotes AI development with a major focus on IP protection in its domestic market, whereas the US sustains its AI progress in the international context as well. This might indicate a considerable bifurcation in the structural patterns of IP protection in global AI development.}

For these technologies to be scalable, ontology must be adopted to semantically represent data generated by building mechanical systems, acting as conduit for connection to Smart Building applications. As the Building Automation System (BAS) industry considers Brick and Project Haystack ontologies for such applications, this paper provides a quantitative comparison of their completeness and expressiveness using a case study. This is contextualized within the broader set of ontological approaches developed for Smart Buildings, and critically evaluated using key ontology qualities outlined in literature. Brick achieved higher assessment values in completeness and expressiveness achieving 59% and 100% respectively, as compared to Haystacks 43% and 96%. Additionally, Brick exhibited five of six desirable qualities, where Haystack exhibited only three. Overall, this critical analysis has found Brick to be preferable to Haystack but still lacking in completeness; to overcome this, it should be integrated with other existing ontologies to serve as a holistic ontology for the longer- term development of Smart Building applications. These will support innovative approachesto sustainability in building operations across scales and as next- generation building controls and automation strategies.}

Information storage is organized in the form of a semantic network of concepts and relations on the "All about the concept" principle in a single repository, which facilitates the work of farmers with this resource. The paper covers storage, editing, verification, and visualization of knowledge representation about the domain of crop production, production resources, agricultural machinery, equipment and other material resources, as well as peculiarities of the tasks of precision farming. The knowledge base of plant production, built on ontological principles, will be useful to enterprise managers, agronomists, machine operators, planning services and other specialists of large, medium and small farms, as well as to individual farmers.}

abstract = {Ontologies and vocabularies are an effective way to promote data interoperability in open data and open science. The deep time knowledge graph is one of the most discussed and studied topics in geoscience ontologies and vocabularies. The continuous evolution of deep time concepts calls for a mechanism of version control and organization to reduce the semantic ambiguity. In this paper we propose a new structure for version control and tracking of concepts, attributes and topological relationships in the deep time knowledge graph. In our work we have reused the existing ontologies for geologic time scale and vocabularies for the International (Chrono)stratigraphic Chart (ISC). Through the new structure, we are able to represent the whole version history of the ISC charts (from 2004 to 2018) in a single knowledge graph. Moreover, the resulting knowledge graph is consistent with the existing ontologies and vocabularies. Experiments of SPARQL queries prove the efficiency of this structure for version tracking of concepts and attributes. We are now extending the knowledge graph with concepts from regional and local geologic time standards, such as North America, Europe, Britain, China, and Australia, and building a graphic user interface for the services. In a future work, we will implement the knowledge graph in data integration workflows. We hope this research will spur more discussion and development of methods for version control of knowledge graphs in geoscience and other disciplines.}

abstract = {Background
Behavioral science is now being integrated into diabetes self-management interventions. However, the challenge that presents itself is how to translate these knowledge resources during care so that primary care practitioners can use them to offer evidence-informed behavior change support and diabetes management recommendations to patients with diabetes.
Objective
The aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a computerized decision support platform called “Diabetes Web-Centric Information and Support Environment” (DWISE) that assists primary care practitioners in applying standardized behavior change strategies and clinical practice guidelines–based recommendations to an individual patient and empower the patient with the skills and knowledge required to self-manage their diabetes through planned, personalized, and pervasive behavior change strategies.
Methods
A health care knowledge management approach is used to implement DWISE so that it features the following functionalities: (1) assessment of primary care practitioners’ readiness to administer validated behavior change interventions to patients with diabetes; (2) educational support for primary care practitioners to help them offer behavior change interventions to patients; (3) access to evidence-based material, such as the Canadian Diabetes Association’s (CDA) clinical practice guidelines, to primary care practitioners; (4) development of personalized patient self-management programs to help patients with diabetes achieve healthy behaviors to meet CDA targets for managing type 2 diabetes; (5) educational support for patients to help them achieve behavior change; and (6) monitoring of the patients’ progress to assess their adherence to the behavior change program and motivating them to ensure compliance with their program. DWISE offers these functionalities through an interactive Web-based interface to primary care practitioners, whereas the patient’s self-management program and associated behavior interventions are delivered through a mobile patient diary via mobile phones and tablets. DWISE has been tested for its usability, functionality, usefulness, and acceptance through a series of qualitative studies.
Results
For the primary care practitioner tool, most usability problems were associated with the navigation of the tool and the presentation, formatting, understandability, and suitability of the content. For the patient tool, most issues were related to the tool’s screen layout, design features, understandability of the content, clarity of the labels used, and navigation across the tool. Facilitators and barriers to DWISE use in a shared decision-making environment have also been identified.
Conclusions
This work has provided a unique electronic health solution to translate complex health care knowledge in terms of easy-to-use, evidence-informed, point-of-care decision aids for primary care practitioners. Patients’ feedback is now being used to make necessary modification to DWISE.}

Utility compliance checking aims to detect spatial non-compliances in underground utilities by examining geospatial data of utilities and their surroundings against textual data of utility regulations. However, the integration of heterogeneous utility geospatial and textual data for compliance checking remains a big challenge. This paper presents a semantic approach to integrate heterogeneous data and enable automated compliance checking of underground utilities through logic and spatial reasoning. The approach consists of the following key components: (1) four interlinked ontologies that provide the semantic schema for heterogeneous data relevant to utility compliance checking, (2) two data convertors for the conversion of heterogeneous data from proprietary formats into a common and interoperable format following the semantic schema, and (3) a query mechanism with spatial extensions for the detection of non-compliant utility instances. The approach was tested on a sample utility database, and the results demonstrate the success of the proposed approach in the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple sources and automated detection of spatial non-compliances in underground utilities. In addition to utility compliance checking, the approach can be extended to other application cases where both data integration from multiple sources and spatial reasoning are required.}

Also, a transversal perspective is expected for aligning and reusing as many sensors as possible (based on an experimental design). Because of the hardware limitations, the experimental design should be communicated as simple, integrated, and consistent as possible under single content fostering the projects’ complementarity. This work describes a strategy for defining and communicating a set of measurement projects, following a conceptual hierarchy derived from a measurement ontology. Every project definition is obtained from the user requirements following a well-established strategy. BriefPD is introduced as a data interchange format that is self-contained, partially verifiable (through a Merkle tree insight), consistent, and does not require the use of tags to determine the content meaning. BriefPD generates a project definition in 6.27 ms (1.9 times quicker than JSON-equivalent), consuming 20.39% of JSON’s size. A Github library is provided with the reference implementation jointly with a ‘Code Ocean’ capsule for reproducing the simulation results.}

Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) is no longer a futuristic technology and has become a day-to-day reality with the increasing ease of availing modern internet services. IoMT services interconnect numerous healthcare ecosystem stakeholders, such as doctors, patients, pharmacists, etc., seamlessly under the light of Advanced Internet Communication Tools (AICT). Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) is a primary constituent of any IoMT device, offering a data acquisition environment through various bio-sensors deployed in edge devices. The data generated through such edge devices should be stored securely in Electronic Health Server (EHS) for further analysis and knowledge inference by medical professionals. Thus designing access control techniques that prevent unauthorised access at the cloud and device level is crucial. Interoperability concern in the IoMT development cycle is becoming a focus of interest for many researchers because most devices and underlying protocols are highly heterogeneous. Lack of worldwide acceptable protocol standards is another major issue in dealing with platform interoperability. In this study, the authors describe the various existing device and data access control strategies such as RBAC (Role Based Access Controlling), CaPBAC (Capability-Based Access Controlling), and ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Controlling), etc. This article majorly surveys the literature from 2000 to 2020 on various access controlling and Interoperability aspects as they are potential players of modern IoT applications. The study also comprehensively discusses the state-of-the-art strategies that provide platform interoperability followed by crucial implementation challenges.

Although this guide shows a strong focus on HRM, it does not illustrate, in a clear way, how to perform each process with the required competencies and the related T&T. Hence, by using only PMBOK processes, the project manager cannot be assisted to select the suitable team according to their skills, also the project team members are not able to interchange their competencies. To address these issues, we propose to use an ontological approach in order to build a common shared representation in the HRM domain. This approach fosters the interoperability among HRs as well as their efficient use of T&T; further it can provide whom using PMBOK a better understanding and guidance for managing HRs with evidence.}

First, we defined a dual taxonomy for the defects in printed and digitized photos. We represented our restoration domain with an ontology and we created some rules to suggest actions to perform in case of some specific events. Classes and properties of the ontology are included into a knowledge base, that grows dynamically with its use. A prototypal tool and a web application version have been implemented as an interface to the database, and to support non-expert users in the restoration process.}

For effective estimation, we need to consider various success factors associated with all possible dimensions. In this article, we look at Scrum-based Agile projects that are developed over multiple sprints. We proposed an extension to the existing algorithm based on a total of 36 success factors; Which estimates the development effort and cost required to complete the project.

Particularly, effective gamified learning needs to strike a balance between gameful design that promotes engagement and does not negatively affect content comprehension and absorption. The existing traditional user-type questionnaires approaches are time-consuming and intrusive, hampering the user’s focus. Previous research in gamification demonstrated how to automate player profile creation through log file analysis of gameful systems instead of traditional approaches, however, psychological archetypes and motivational groups can simplify the process of collecting data to achieve a balanced level of personalization for gamified systems, which are grounded on the user’s profile and preferences which can help with their immersion. To attend to the needs of a wide range of fields that introduce gamification to systems that are not classified as games, a new ludic approach was created to define user types based on user interaction using symbolic images. In this exploratory research, we tested this approach in two card-sorting studies (N=35 and N=19). Our results show that the images can be used to predict the users’ archetypes and motivational groups accurately. Thus, we contribute with validating an image-based user type classification method that is easier to deploy in systems that do not aim to behave as a game but are looking to reap the benefits of personalizing a user’s content and gameful experience where relevant. Our second contribution is delivering guidelines to replicate this validation method to other existing approaches. We expect that with this guideline, we facilitate personalization with other user typologies without disrupting the gameful experience.}

Participants ranging from laypersons to experts were surveyed in three workshops to evaluate both the public and expert interfaces of the EnArgus system in comparison to peer systems. The results showed that the EnArgus system was predominantly evaluated positively by the various participants. It contributes to making the energy sector more transparent and offers clear advantages for professional use compared to similar systems. The system’s semantic processing enables more precise hits and better coverage by including semantically related terms in search results; its intelligence makes it fail-safe, rendering it suitable for areas where poor results can have dire consequences. Reporting on an actual real-world system, the paper also provides a roadmap-view of how electronic filing of administrative project data can be semantically enhanced and opened-up to provide the basis for new ways into the data that are key for future breakthrough AI interfaces.}

Two-thirds of the building consumption is for residential buildings. To achieve energy efficiency, buildings are being integrated with IoT devices through the use of smart IoT services. For instance, a smart space heating service reduces energy consumption by dynamically heating apartments based on indoor and outdoor temperatures. The W3C recommends the use of the Web of Things (WoT) standard to enable IoT interoperability on the Web. However, in the context of a smart building, the ability to search and discover building metadata and IoT devices available in the WoT ecosystems remains a challenge due to the limitation of the current WoT Discovery, which only includes a directory containing only IoT devices metadata without including building metadata. Integrating the IoT device's metadata with building metadata in the same directory can provide better discovery capabilities to the IoT services providers. In this paper, we integrate building metadata into the W3C WoT Discovery through the construction of a Building Description JSON-LD file. This Building Description is integrated into the W3C WoT Discovery and based on the domOS Common Ontology (dCO) to achieve semantic interoperability in smart residential buildings for the WoT IoT ecosystem within the Horizon 2020 domOS project. This integration results in a Thing and Building Description Directory. dCO integrates the SAREF core ontology with the Thing Description ontology, devices, and building metadata. We have implemented and validated the WoT discovery on top of a WoT Thing and Building Description Directory. The WoT Discovery implementation is also made available for the WoT community.}

abstract = {The need for interoperable semantics in modern information systems forces to develop more and more intelligent solutions. The increasing demand for these solutions, the explosion of various types of information and the technological development pose new challenges and requirements. Ontologies are often viewed as the answer to this need. The connections between ontologies and Semantic Web become a very promising area. The Semantic Web’s success is dependent on the quality of its underline ontologies, whereas ontologies provide a shared and a common understanding of a domain enabling communication between people and heterogeneous and distributed systems. However, key issue helps ontologies to power the Semantic Web have made ontology learning from various data sources a very auspicious field of research. It aims at semi-automatically or automatically building ontologies from given data sources with a limited human exert. A huge number of available approaches for ontology learning and the prominent differences between them cause the necessity of knowledge systematization for this domain. The paper yields the author’s proposal of ontological elaboration for methods for ontology learning and their features, providing formal, practical and technological guidance to knowledge management based approach to methods supporting ontology learning.}

The authors argue the way Internet of Things (IoT) solutions are conceived as singularly focused “point solutions” undermine future opportunities. An evolutionary view is overlooked because extant literature describes technology in a particular epoch. An ecosystem perspective needs to influence IT strategy as an emerging “digital layer” transcends a smart city and continues to function long after a traditional construction project completes. We describe innovation as a succession of transformational waves in an evolutionary process that is currently manifesting as “Industry 4.0” and changing expectations for the construction industry. The paper concludes by listing emerging trends and warns existing UK construction companies must understand the transformational process they are in and learn how to adapt with a stronger drive for R&D.}

However, the current approach often fails to consider the multi-perspectives of structural design, such as safety, environmental issues and cost in a comprehensive way. This paper presents a holistic approach based on knowledge processing (ontology) to facilitate a smarter decision-making process for early design stage by informing designers of the environmental impact and cost along with safety considerations. The approach can give a reasoning based quantitative understanding of how the design alternatives using different concrete materials can affect the ultimate overall performance. Embodied CO2 and cost are both considered along with safety criteria as indicative multi-perspectives to demonstrate the novelty of the approach. A case study of a concrete structural frame is used to explain how the proposed method can be used by structural designers when taking multi performance criteria into account. The major contribution of the paper lies on the creation of a holistic knowledge base which links through different knowledge across sectors to enable the structural engineer to come up with much more comprehensive decisions instead of individual single objective targeted delivery.}

abstract = {The concept of weak signal (WS) was proposed by Igor Ansoff in the 1970s to describe early information about an emerging phenomenon in organizational environments. Surprising events can be avoided by methods for monitoring and analyzing these signals, continually. These methods enable the detection process of potential threats and opportunities that may arise from those surprising events. While this strategic process is very useful, conventional methods for WS monitoring and analysis do not avoid cognitive and motivational problems that can harm the competitive intelligence capacity of organizations. The solution of these problems can be related to methods that allow conducting the detection process collectively, quickly and with the least effort, through the eventual support of automatic tools. Ontologies, for example, are computational artifacts that represent organizational knowledge whose features can be used in a conceptual system for classification of WS. The purpose of this work is to present such system, which also uses Web crawling, competitive forces and PESTLE analysis in the detection of threats and opportunities. A case example also is discussed showing that this approach can be used as a viable alternative to support surveillance of strategic discontinuities that permeate the organizational environment.}

Due to the economic, environmental, social, and sustainability implications, proper waste management has become a worldwide concern. In response to this problem, strategies have been implemented to develop clean energy, improve the efficiency of industrial resources, and recycle and reuse materials. As a result, the concept of industrial symbiosis (IS) has emerged as a strategy for waste utilization in a productive chain, based on physical exchanges of waste and materials, which finds ways to use the waste from one industry as inputs or raw materials for the other, all supported by business collaboration. This work aims to identify the opportunities and challenges that emerging and frontier countries have for waste utilization through the IS approach through a literature review. The needs that triggered the IS and how researchers materialized this approach to integrate the harnessing resources and materials in economic activities were identified. This paper identifies how emerging and frontier countries realize solid waste management through IS, and highlights opportunities for governments, researchers, and stakeholders to make effective decisions to achieve sustainable development, reduce environmental concerns and address current waste management issues. The literature review identified IS as an excellent way to dispose of and use the solid waste but also showed that emerging and frontier countries face many challenges in solid waste management due to the lack of policies focused on sustainability, lack of communication and trust among stakeholders, low use of technology in the industrial sector and technical barriers.}

Currently, most sensor-based activity recognition techniques rely on supervised learning algorithms. However, the acquisition of comprehensive training sets of activities in smart homes is expensive and violates the individual’s privacy. In this work, we address this problem by proposing a novel hybrid approach that couples collaborative active learning with probabilistic and knowledge-based reasoning. The rationale of our approach is that a generic, and possibly incomplete, knowledge-based model of activities can be refined to target specific individuals and environments by collaboratively acquiring feedback from inhabitants. Specifically, we propose a collaborative active learning method exploiting users’ feedback to (i) refine correlations among sensor events and activity types that are initially extracted from a high-level ontology, and (ii) mine temporal patterns of sensor events that are frequently generated by the execution of specific activities. A Markov Logic Network is used to recognize activities with probabilistic rules that capture both the ontological knowledge and the information obtained by active learning. We experimented our solution with a real-world dataset of activities carried out by several individuals in an interleaved fashion. Experimental results show that our collaborative and personalized active learning solution significantly improves recognition rates, while triggering a small number of feedback requests. Moreover, the overall recognition rates compare favorably with existing supervised and unsupervised activity recognition methods.}

keywords = {COVID-19, medical informatics, sentinel surveillance},
abstract = {Background
Creating an ontology for COVID-19 surveillance should help ensure transparency and consistency. Ontologies formalize conceptualizations at either the domain or application level. Application ontologies cross domains and are specified through testable use cases. Our use case was an extension of the role of the Oxford Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) to monitor the current pandemic and become an in-pandemic research platform.
Objective
This study aimed to develop an application ontology for COVID-19 that can be deployed across the various use-case domains of the RCGP RSC research and surveillance activities.
Methods
We described our domain-specific use case. The actor was the RCGP RSC sentinel network, the system was the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outcomes were the spread and effect of mitigation measures. We used our established 3-step method to develop the ontology, separating ontological concept development from code mapping and data extract validation. We developed a coding system–independent COVID-19 case identification algorithm. As there were no gold-standard pandemic surveillance ontologies, we conducted a rapid Delphi consensus exercise through the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Health Care Informatics working group and extended networks.
Results
Our use-case domains included primary care, public health, virology, clinical research, and clinical informatics. Our ontology supported (1) case identification, microbiological sampling, and health outcomes at an individual practice and at the national level; (2) feedback through a dashboard; (3) a national observatory; (4) regular updates for Public Health England; and (5) transformation of a sentinel network into a trial platform. We have identified a total of 19,115 people with a definite COVID-19 status, 5226 probable cases, and 74,293 people with possible COVID-19, within the RCGP RSC network (N=5,370,225).
Conclusions
The underpinning structure of our ontological approach has coped with multiple clinical coding challenges. At a time when there is uncertainty about international comparisons, clarity about the basis on which case definitions and outcomes are made from routine data is essential.}

This paper presents DABGEO: a reusable and usable global ontology for the energy domain that provides a common representation of energy domains represented by existing energy ontologies. DABGEO can be reused by ontology engineers to develop ontologies for specific energy management applications. In contrast to previous global energy ontologies, it follows a layered structure to provide a balance of reusability–usability. In this work, we provide an overview of the structure of DABGEO and we explain how to reuse it in a particular application case.

The new decentralized manufacturing automation paradigm features ubiquitous communication and interoperable interactions between machines. However, peer-to-peer (P2P) interoperable communications at the semantic level between industrial machines is a challenge. To address this challenge, we introduce a concept of Semantic-aware Cyber-Physical Systems (SCPSs) based on which manufacturing devices can establish semantic M2M communications. In this work, we propose a generic system architecture of SCPS and its enabling technologies. Our proposed system architecture adds a semantic layer and a communication layer to the conventional cyber-physical system (CPS) in order to maximize compatibility with the diverse CPS implementation architecture. With Semantic Web technologies as the backbone of the semantic layer, SCPSs can exchange semantic messages with maximum interoperability following the same understanding of the manufacturing context. A pilot implementation of the presented work is illustrated with a proof-of-concept case study between two semantic-aware cyber-physical machine tools. The semantic communication provided by the SCPS architecture makes ubiquitous M2M communication in a network of manufacturing devices environment possible, laying the foundation for collaborative manufacturing automation for achieving smart manufacturing. Another case study focusing on decentralized production control between machines in a workshop also proved the merits of semantic-aware M2M communication technologies.}

The vast amount of data generated by these devices must be controlled totally securely. The centralized solutions are not capable of responding to these concerns due to security challenges and scalability problems. Thus, blockchain technology is an effective solution, and the “distributed” method has been employed to overcome these concerns to allow for entirely secure communication between devices. The present paper proposes a technique consisting of two steps. The first step deals with the authentication of each node using the identity-based signature to secure communication between devices on a blockchain platform. In the second step, blocks are sent by hashing. For this purpose, the identities of the devices have been used as public keys. The theory analysis and simulation results indicated the superiority of the proposed method in terms of average detection rate, throughput, scalability, time spent on block authentication, and consumption energy compared to S-LoRaWAN and DLBA-IoT. Also, the simulation results show how the proposed approach can significantly increase the security of each thing and network security.}

This paper presents the sequential routing framework which we believe is the first method to adapt a CapsNet-only structure to sequence-to-sequence recognition. Input sequences are capsulized then sliced by a window size. Each slice is classified to a label at the corresponding time through iterative routing mechanisms. Afterwards, losses are computed by connectionist temporal classification (CTC). During routing, the required number of parameters can be controlled by the window size regardless of the length of sequences by sharing learnable weights across the slices. We additionally propose a sequential dynamic routing algorithm to replace traditional dynamic routing. The proposed technique can minimize decoding speed degradation caused by the routing iterations since it can operate in a non-iterative manner without dropping accuracy. The method achieves a 1.1% lower word error rate at 16.9% on the Wall Street Journal corpus compared to bidirectional long short-term memory-based CTC networks. On the TIMIT corpus, it attains a 0.7% lower phone error rate at 17.5% compared to convolutional neural network-based CTC networks (Zhang et al., 2016).}
