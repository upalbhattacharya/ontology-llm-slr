  abstract={Developing software systems for various domains is a complex task. The quality of the system, corresponding to the domain requirements, can only be achieved via involving the model development of experts in the relevant fields. Traditional design methods based on the using professional tools and modeling languages are difficult for subject matter experts. Using Domain Specific Languages (DSL) have been increasingly gaining attention of developers because DSLs are created to cope with specific domain particularities. However, DSL development consists of several steps to be performed can be hard. Identifying the correct set of elements and constructions of DSL, defining their constraints can be very error-prone. Automation of the new DSLs development is relevant task. The designing of new DSLs should be based on the knowledge of experts, which can be represented using an ontology. An approach to DSM platform development based on using multifaceted ontology to DSL design is proposed. Examples of DSLs and models illustrating the applicability of the proposed methodology are described.},

  title={Classification and Mapping of Model Elements for Designing Runtime Reconfigurable Systems}, 
  year={2021},

  pages={156337-156360},
  abstract={Embedded systems are ubiquitous and control many critical functions in society. A fairly new type of embedded system has emerged with the advent of partial reconfiguration, i.e. runtime reconfigurable systems. They are attracting interest in many different applications. Such a system is capable of reconfiguring itself at the hardware level and without the need to halt the application’s execution. While modeling and implementing these systems is far from a trivial task, there is currently a lack of systematic approaches to tackle this issue. In other words, there is no unanimously agreed upon modeling paradigm that can capture adaptive behaviors at the highest level of abstraction, especially when regarding the design entry, namely, the initial high-level application and platform models. Given this, our paper proposes two domain ontologies for application and virtual platform models used to derive a classification system and to provide a set of rules on how the different model elements are allowed to be composed together. The application behavior is captured through a formal model of computation which dictates the semantics of execution, concurrency, and synchronization. The main contribution of this paper is to combine suitable formal models of computation, a functional modeling language, and two domain ontologies to create a systematic design flow from an abstract executable application model into a virtual implementation model based on a runtime reconfigurable architecture (virtual platform model) using well-defined mapping rules. We demonstrate the applicability, generality, and potential of the proposed model element classification system and mapping rules by applying them to representative and complete examples: an encoder/decoder system and an avionics attitude estimation system. Both cases yield a virtual implementation model from an abstract application model.},

  pages={143-152},
  abstract={Agile has become one of the most popular software development approaches thanks to its flexible and evolutive features. To find further suitable practices, teams start to follow the tailoring approach by choosing only the fragments of different methods that fit their needs and context. Many tailoring approaches have been proposed by orienting different aspects such as process, resource and goal. While the interaction between team members is very important in agile methods, none of these approaches focuses on the socio-intentional aspect. In the literature, we can find many case studies that link socio-intentional aspects to the tailoring of agile practices. Even though it is helpful to know it, locating relevant information can be effort and time-consuming. This research proposes a socio-intentional framework that can analyze agile practices and indicate how to tailor them with the help of an evidence-based tool and a modeling language. This framework will allow practitioners to identify the right practices to achieve their goals and analyze their suitability and vulnerability. It will also indicate how to successfully implement them in the software development process.},

  abstract={The design of a complex warship is a multidisciplinary effort which often encounters major challenges, particularly with respect to integration across interfaces in the System of Systems (SoS). In principle, the goal of Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) with respect to system design is to provide a means of capturing and communicating the system design in a structured, consistent, and coherent fashion; that can be easily assessed by engineering teams and quickly analysed using queries and toolsets. The focus of this paper is to investigate the potential to achieve a consistent description, identify a viable methodology that minimises mismatch in requirements and to avoid an extended design lifecycle. This study highlights the need to develop a generic Architectural Description (AD) that is based on a common ontology which would clearly define the fundamental tenets of applying state-of-the-art Architectural Frameworks (AFs) in naval ship design. An investigation on the effectiveness and accuracy of a graph-based approach is needed to assess whether it is possible to create a ‘Rosetta stone’ for AFs, which links any two or more different model viewpoints in different AF’s using the approach.},

  title={A Model-Based Systems Engineering Approach to Support Continuous Validation in PGE - Product Generation Engineering}, 
  year={2021},

  number={},
  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Increasing customer demands, especially regarding functionality, safety and environmental sustainability, are major drivers of nowadays product development processes. Those increasing demands as well as today’s product development context of distributed interdisciplinary development teams lead to an increasing complexity of systems as well as their respective development processes. MBSE - Model-Based Systems Engineering is regarded as a promising approach to cope with this complexity. MBSE aims at supporting during the whole product lifecycle in system analysis, requirements management, design as well as verification and validation. Especially validation plays a central role in product development as it is the only activity that can ensure customer satisfaction and thus a successful product on the market. However, comprehensive MBSE-approaches to support validation in product development seem to be missing. This paper describes such a MBSE approach to support validation in product development. The approach includes an ontology of terms and their interrelations in the context of validation. The ontology is used to construct viewpoints, views and a modeling framework to structure a system model in the understanding of MBSE. In addition, a modeling method interacting with the constructed views is developed and presented. The presented approach aims at enabling a continuous validation concept, starting in the early phase of PGE - Product Generation Engineering and continuing throughout the entire lifecycle. Furthermore, the approach should support in integrating the development of products and appropriate validation systems, creating a consistent traceability of information throughout the created models. Finally, a specific focus of the approach lies on usability in order to guarantee individual and organizational acceptance. This acceptance is of particular importance to realize a human centered development as it is envisioned in approaches such as ASE - Advanced Systems Engineering.},

  abstract={In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach for knowledge graph (KG) creation from conversational data. We make use of intent classification and slot-filling, the two important components of any dialogue agent, exploit their interconnectedness, and finally construct a KG. We build a supervised intent classifier to extract the intent classes, and then on top of this we run our occlusion based slot-information extraction algorithm. Our algorithm is able to make use of supervised training of intent classifiers for extracting the relevant slot-information in an unsupervised way. To test the effectiveness of our system, we perform both automatic and manual evaluation of our intent-classifier and slot-filling system on three dialog datasets. Finally, we construct a knowledge graph from the dialogue conversation using an algorithm that makes use of our occlusion based slot-information extraction module. Empirical evaluation shows that our occlusion based method is able to successfully extract slot information from conversations, resulting in a high-quality KG.},

  abstract={Text embedding has recently emerged as a very useful and successful method for semantic representation. Following initial word-level embedding methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and topic-based bag-of-words approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the focus has turned to language models and text encoders implemented as neural networks - ranging from word-level models to those embedding whole documents. The distinctive feature of these models is their ability to infer semantic spaces at all levels based purely on data, with no need for complexities such as syntactic analysis or ontology building. Many of these models are available pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, providing downstream applications with general-purpose semantic spaces. In particular, embedding models at the sentence level or higher are most useful in applications because the meaning of text only becomes clear at that level. Most text embedding methods produce text embeddings in high-dimensional spaces, with a dimensionality ranging from a few hundred to thousands. However, it is often useful to visualize semantic spaces in very low dimension, which requires the use of dimensionality reduction methods. It is not clear what language models and what method of dimensionality reduction would work well in these cases. In this paper, we compare four text embedding methods in combination with three methods of dimensionality reduction to map three related real-world datasets comprising textual descriptions of items in a particular domain (sports) to a 2-dimensional semantic visualization space. The results provide several insights into the utility of these methods for data of this type.},

  pages={573-578},
  abstract={Question answering can be considered as a key area in Natural Language Processing and Information Retrieval, where users construct queries in natural language and receive suitable answers in return. In the travel domain, most questions are “content questions”, where the expected answer is not the equivalent of “yes” or “no”, but rather factual information. Replying to a free-form factual question based on a large collection of text is challenging. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of question answering systems can be improved by adding a classification phase based on the expected answer type. This paper focuses on implementing a multi-level, multi-class question classification system focusing on the travel domain. Existing research for the travel domain is conducted using language-specific features and traditional Machine Learning models. In contrast, this research employs transformer-based state-of-the-art deep contextualized word embedding models for question classification. The proposed method improves the coarse class Micro F1-Score by 5.43% compared to the baseline. Fine-grain Micro F1-Score has also improved by 3.8%. We also present an empirical analysis of the effectiveness of different transformer-based deep contextualized word embedding models for multi-level multi-class classification.},

  abstract={The aim of information retrieval (IR) process is to respond effectively to user queries by retrieving information that are better meets their expectations. A gap could exist between user information needs and his/her defined context as the level of the user's expertise in the search domain is directly influencing the query richness. The information retrieval system (IRS) must be intelligent enough to identify information needs and respond effectively to meet the expected needs, regardless the level of user's expertise level. This process is difficult and it remains a major and open challenge in the domain of IR. IR models integrate many sources to achieve an effective retrieval system. Semantic IR is an environment in which semantic techniques were applied to sort the documents according to their degree of relevance to the query. The present work proposes a hybrid model to rank documents. The proposed model is based on a query likelihood language model and the semantic similarity between concepts to assess the relevance between query-document pairs. Concepts were extracted by projection on WordNet ontology then word sense disambiguation was conducted. A semantic index was built to validate the proposed model. The conducted empirical experiments show that the proposed model is outperformed the compared benchmarks in the measured IR metrics.},

  abstract={In recent years, various neural network architectures have been successfully applied to natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as named entity normalization. Named entity normalization is a fundamental task for extracting information in free text, which aims to map entity mentions in a text to gold standard entities in a given domain-specific ontology; however, the normalization task in the biomedical domain is still challenging because of multiple synonyms, various acronyms, and numerous lexical variations. In this study, we regard the task of biomedical entity normalization as a ranking problem and propose an approach to rank normalized concepts. We additionally employ two factors that can notably affect the performance of normalization, such as task-specific pre-training (Task-PT) and calibration approach. Among five different biomedical benchmark corpora, our experimental results show that our proposed model achieved significant improvements over the previous methods and advanced the state-of-the-art performance for biomedical entity normalization, with up to 0.5% increase in accuracy and 1.2% increase in F-score.},

  abstract={Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has been widely used in the development of complex systems. The system architectures, organizations, research and development processes using MBSE to design complex systems can be seen as a System of Systems (SoS), which has high complexity and hard to manage. The concept of digital thread is proposed to integrate all the models and data in the SoS. However, lack of cognition ability makes it hard to connect the models and data with human, processes and things in the SoS, which reduces the efficiency of complex system development. In this paper, a new concept named Cognitive Thread is first proposed as digital thread with augmented semantic capabilities for identifying the information of the SoS. Then a cognitive thread construction approach based on Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) specification and knowledge graphs is proposed to support decision-making and management in the SoS. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed approach is verified through a case study of the advanced driver-assistance system development.},

  title={Method for Biomedical Information Extraction of Immunosuppressive Cell Properties}, 
  year={2021},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={210-213},
  abstract={Automated extraction of cell populations' immunosuppressive properties from research articles is a basic problem, which requires specialized methods and tools for meta-analysis of publications. It is necessary to extract information about specific types of cells, their roles in the text, detect the immunosuppressive properties of cell populations, and certain types of relationships. It is also crucial to filter out those texts, which describe immunosuppressive features of different chemical compounds or drugs. Typically, efficient automatic information extraction requires a relatively large set of samples or marked-up texts. The paper presents a novel information extraction method that can be useful for such an analysis. This method uses external linguistic resources and can be trained on limited corpora. Namely, the method combines medical ontologies, rich unsupervised lexis representations (Fasttext word embeddings) with rule-based entity and relationship extraction, and supervised machine learning-based post-filtering. The developed method allows one to extract information about the target cells (for “in vitro” experiments), effector cells, diseases ("in vivo”), and arbitrary descriptions of immune suppression. In the paper, we also present a manually labeled corpus to train immunosuppressive information extraction methods. That corpus contains texts of 330 PubMed Central abstracts. The experiments on that corpus show the method has relatively high evaluation scores on the labeled dataset. Therefore, the proposed method makes it possible to identify descriptions of the immunosuppressive properties of cell populations in biomedical texts with sufficiently high quality. In the future, the method can be applied to perform an automatic meta-analysis of research in immunosuppressive cell therapy.},

  abstract={The vision of achieving digital engineering in the US Department of Defense has instigated work on defining the information content and structure of the system model. However, few seem to have asked what are the requirements for the system model? In this paper, we use a requirements process to elicit and define the requirements for the system model. The system model is a digital artifact containing descriptions of all the essential objects, their properties, and the relationships between them for the system-of-interest (SoI). The paper describes the context of the system model in relationships to the other components of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) consisting of a modeling language, schema, model-based process, presentation framework, MBSE tools, and knowledgeable workforce. The paper describes how these components interact to provide effective MBSE. Requirements are stated for each component. The paper additionally derives information requirements for the system model according to the systems engineering process’s information needs by examining the inputs and outputs of each activity in the systems engineering process. Lastly, the paper derives the quality characteristics for the system model from the literature on ontologies, modeling languages, and semiotics. The result is a set of requirements for the system model to support MBSE and the digital thread.},

  pages={54298-54309},
  abstract={Service clustering is an efficient method for facilitating service discovery and composition. Traditional approaches based on the self-description documents for services usually utilize service signatures. In Web service composition, service clustering can also be performed by the invocation relationship between services. Therefore, based on the successful development of several embedding techniques for words in several contexts, a novel deep learning-based service embedding using invocation sequences is devised for service clustering. Moreover, many microservices are being created because of the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge, and fog computing. Following these developments, Web service composition based on these environments has emerged in abundance. More efficient lightweight approaches to analyze large numbers of services are necessary for service clustering. Consequently, a lightweight deep learning-based approach for the semantic clustering of service composition is presented to address these requirements. In this paper, we first propose the concept of service embedding to capture semantic information from invocation sequences. Second, we suggest using state-of-the-art neural language sequence models for service embedding and develop a corresponding lightweight Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT)-based model. Next, combined with K-means clustering, the semantic clustering of service composition is evaluated. Finally, the experimental results show that the clustering process can be effectively performed by the lightweight BERT-based model.},

  abstract={Studying food recipes is indispensable to understand the science of cooking. An essential problem in food computing is the adaptation of recipes to user needs and preferences. The main difficulty when adapting recipes is in determining ingredients relations, which are compound and hard to interpret. Word embedding models can catch the semantics of food items in a recipe, helping to understand how ingredients are combined and substituted. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for adapting ingredient recipes to user preferences. To learn food representations and relations, we create and apply a specific-domain word embedding model. In contrast to previous works, we not only use the list of ingredients to train the model but also the cooking instructions. We enrich the ingredient data by mapping them to a nutrition database to guide the adaptation and find ingredient substitutes. We performed three different kinds of recipe adaptation based on nutrition preferences, adapting to similar ingredients, and vegetarian and vegan diet restrictions. With a 95% of confidence, our method can obtain quality adapted recipes without a previous knowledge extraction on the recipe adaptation domain. Our results confirm the potential of using a specific-domain semantic model to tackle the recipe adaptation task.},

This technology is really appealing in Internet of Things (IoT) domain because smart devices generate events for software agents involved in a smart contract execution, making full automation possible. However, smart contracts have to comply with national and international laws and accountability of participant's actions. Soundness of a smart contract has to be verified in terms of law compliance. Here, we propose a model for verification and validation of law compliance of smart contracts in IoT environments.

  abstract={In task-oriented dialogue systems the dialogue state tracker component (DST) is responsible for predicting the current state of the dialogue based on the dialogue history and the user utterance. Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology, a fact that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents, where the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback, we propose a domain-aware dialogue state tracker, that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to predict for dynamic service schemas, including zero-shot domains. Unlike approaches that propose separate models for prediction of intents, requested slots, slot status, categorical slots and non-categorical slots, we propose a single model in an end-to-end architecture. The proposed model utilizes domain and slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations from a given dialogue, and then uses such representations to predict the values of the corresponding slot in a given domain. Integrating this mechanism with pretrained language models, our approach can effectively learn semantic relations and effectively perform transfer learning between domains or zero-shot tracking for domains not present in training.},

  abstract={Software smells have negative impacts on the reliability and modifiability of software systems. The smells in architecture design can be cascaded down to the implementation level and cause issues that require much effort to fix. Therefore, early detection of the architecture smells can benefit the overall quality of the software system. This paper presents an integration of methods that formally define the software architecture design towards architecture smell detection. Our approach serves as a framework that allows the architectural structures and behaviours to be formally analysed based on a coherent technique. We evaluated the accuracy and performance of our approach with the models generated from open source projects. The results show that our approach is effective and functions well.},

  abstract={This chapter presents Methodical Approach to Executable Integrated Modeling (MAXIM) and its implementation environment, OPCloud. The MAXIM framework enables concurrent modeling of the hardware and software system aspects, avoiding the need to make the painful and information‐leaking transition from the abstract, qualitative conceptual system architecting stage to the concrete, detailed, quantitative design stage. The MAXIM environment aims to overcome the widening hardware‐software modeling gap, stepping toward bringing systems engineering and software engineering closer together. OPCloud is revolutionary in that it is the first and only modeling environment that enables modeling systems not just conceptually; the same environment also provides the modeler with the ability to proceed with detailed, quantitative design that is integrated into the qualitative model. The chapter discusses the sharing of model data and describes collaboration facilities as built into OPCloud.},

  abstract={Data normalization methodologies are extremely welcome to link extracted information from textual data to different semantic resources. These methodologies have been previously well researched especially in the biomedical domain, where health concepts were normalized and described using semantic tags. Recently, a methodology for normalizing food concepts has been proposed, based on Named-Entity Recognition methods resulting in the FoodOntoMap semantic resource. In this paper, we propose and evaluate a new architecture for linking phrases (i.e. textual name for foods) to concepts from semantic resources in the Food and Nutrition domain. We represent the food phrases (i.e. their textual name) in continuous vector space using state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) embedding algorithms, and evaluate their proximity with respect to the annotated semantic food concepts. Additionally, indexing was incorporated to improve efficiency.The GloVe embedding with mean pooling provided best evaluation results, with maximum recall of 74% for the Snomed CT semantic dataset, which is promising result, but also opens a space for future improvement of the phrase representations, and their incorporation in this system.},

  abstract={Manipulation tasks in daily life, such as pouring water, unfold through human intentions. Being able to process contextual knowledge from these Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) over time can help us understand manipulation intentions, which are essential for an intelligent robot to transition smoothly between various manipulation actions. In this paper, to model the intended concepts of manipulation, we present a vision dataset under a strictly constrained knowledge domain for both robot and human manipulations, where manipulation concepts and relations are stored by an ontology system in a taxonomic manner. Furthermore, we propose a scheme to generate a combination of visual attentions and an evolving knowledge graph filled with commonsense knowledge. Our scheme works with real-world camera streams and fuses an attention-based Vision-Language model with the ontology system. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can successfully represent the evolution of an intended object manipulation procedure for both robots and humans. The proposed scheme allows the robot to mimic human-like intentional behaviors by watching real-time videos. We aim to develop this scheme further for real-world robot intelligence in Human-Robot Interaction.},

  abstract={In the last years, the Internet of Things (IoT) know a huge widespread thanks to the increase of the connected objects number. The IoT technology has several benefits that make it among the proliferation technology. The major advantage of this technology is the communication between devices known as Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication allowing them to be connected without human intervention. Thanks to this advantage, the technology become able to facilitate the people's lives that it become smoother through a seamless cooperation between virtual objects and physical ones. As well as, the IoT sweep various fields (e.g., industry, health) thanks to its capacity to automate tasks.In this setting, a tremendous number of business managers are interesting to integrate the IoT devices into their Business Processes (BPs), known in literature as IoT-aware BP. This integration gives the opportunity to the business managers to avail from the IoT technology in their process through an enhancement of the business performance and an achievement of the business competitiveness. Thus, several researchers competed to identify approaches and methods to integrate the IoT technology within the BP paradigm. In this paper, we present a review of the different proposed approaches that deal with the integration of the IoT technology within the BP. Furthermore, we give in this paper, a rich comparative analysis based on a set of criteria. Finally, we identify some initiatives and challenges in the IoT-aware BP paradigm.},

  abstract={With the rise of artificial intelligence, it is time to shape the systems engineering tooling environment for the future. In the last decade, we have seen several emerging technologies that will potentially have a great impact in complex systems. These new technologies are expected to cause a disruptive impact not only in the products but also in to the tools used across the whole product life cycle. For this reason, is imperative to perform a critical review of the current systems engineering tooling ecosystem. This assessment should also map the open research problems that could prevent the complete integration of the new technologies into the systems engineering framework. This paper proposes a new architecture for a system engineering environment to operate in large scale projects. The objective of this research is twofold: it will first identify the capabilities for the next generation platform, and secondly, it will evaluate how artificial intelligence applications can be integrated in compliance with DO-330. The concept developed by this research will drive tool design recommendations enabling the use of artificial intelligence driven applications in a systems engineering tooling ecosystem.},

  abstract={Increasing digitization and automation is a widely accepted method to cope with the challenges of constantly increasing air traffic. The analogue communication of air traffic controllers (ATCo) to pilots has been excluded so far from the digitization process. However, the content of this communication is of decisive importance for various automation systems. Although Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) has recently significantly improved the recognition performance and, therefore, enables the digitization of ATCo-pilot-communication, its adaptation to other airports is a critical and costly process, This is even more important, if ATCos tend to deviate from the published ICAO phraseology: “start reducing to two fifty” instead of “reduce two five zero knots” is just an example. User acceptance requires that these deviations are also correctly recognized. Therefore, this paper presents an approach, which automatically learns a so-called Command Extraction Model from labelled controller utterances. The initial Command Extraction Model without learning only covers 60% of the commands, whereas the automatically learned Command Extraction Model covers more than 98%. With just six hours of training data we could achieve 94%.},

  abstract={The paper presents an efficient approach to the semantic enrichment of measured sensor data in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs), by bridging techniques from Model-driven Software Development (MDSD) and Semantic Web Technology (SWT). Our approach reinforces data interoperability, fostering data sharing and reuse, by utilizing SWT. Model-based and type-agnostic configuration reduces the overall effort for WSN setup and maintenance, which are traditionally complex and time-consuming tasks. The presented approach addresses the problem of large-scale WSN management through the application of SWT in WSN configuration and management without requiring expert knowledge. Additionally, we present a generic architecture and an implementation which is also supplemented by hands-on descriptions of an illustrative use case. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model-based approach provides non-intrusive semantic enrichment with sub-millisecond computational overhead, as well as partially automated configuration of WSNs.},

The first part of this paper is using criminal law domain knowledge and supreme court judgment results, to be the initial domain information and result is the rules that humans can understand. The second part of this paper is bringing training data set from the final judgment to train with deep learning methods. Due to the training set which have severe imbalances, the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) [1] is used to solve this problem. Models are trained on the training set using unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [2] networks and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) [3] are type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [2]. The word embeddings of the dataset can be learned while training a deep neural network. BiLSTM average F1 score is higher than LSTM. Pre-trained word embeddings are then used to make the average F1 score higher than before. Finally, using models to predict online crime news, the highest average probability of each model is selected by using Soft Voting as input to the rules. The test results compared with the predictions of our methods with the opinion of the lawyer, corresponding 76%.},

  abstract={A contract is a legally binding agreement that expresses high-level requirements of parties in terms of obligations, powers and constraints. Parties' actions influence the status of a contract and shall comply with its clauses. Manual contract monitoring is very laborious in real markets, such as transactive energy, where plenty of complex contracts are running concurrently. Furthermore, liability, right and performance transition through run-time operations such as subcontracting, assignment and substitution complicate contract interpretation. Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations. In this thesis research, I propose an innovative ontology that defines fundamental contractual notions (such as the ones mentioned above) and their relationships, on which is built a specification language, called Symboleo, that provides syntax and axiomatic semantics of contracts via first-order logic. Symboleo enables the development of advanced automation tools such as a compliance checker that monitors contracts at runtime, and a model checking verification method that analyzes liveness and safety properties of contracts. This paper reports on the problem domain, research method, current status, expected contributions, and main foreseen challenges.},

  abstract={Understanding manipulation scenarios allows intelligent robots to plan for appropriate actions to complete a manipulation task successfully. It is essential for intelligent robots to semantically interpret manipulation knowledge by describing entities, relations and attributes in a structural manner. In this paper, we propose an implementing framework to generate high-level conceptual dynamic knowledge graphs from video clips. A combination of a Vision-Language model and an ontology system, in correspondence with visual perception and contextual semantics, is used to represent robot manipulation knowledge with Entity-Relation-Entity (E-R-E) and Entity-Attribute-Value (E-A-V) tuples. The proposed method is flexible and well-versed. Using the framework, we present a case study where robot performs manipulation actions in a kitchen environment, bridging visual perception with contextual semantics using the generated dynamic knowledge graphs.},

  abstract={Knowledge Base, represents facts about the world, often in some form of subsumption ontology, rather than implicitly, embedded in procedural code, the way a conventional computer program does. While there is a rapid growth in knowledge bases, it poses a challenge of retrieving information from them. Knowledge Base Question Answering is one of the promising approaches for extracting substantial knowledge from Knowledge Bases. Unlike web search, Question Answering over a knowledge base gives accurate and concise results, provided that natural language questions can be understood and mapped precisely to an answer in the knowledge base. However, some of the existing embedding-based methods for knowledge base question answering systems ignore the subtle correlation between the question and the Knowledge Base (e.g., entity types, relation paths, and context) and suffer from the Out Of Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we focused on using a pre-trained language model for the Knowledge Base Question Answering task. Firstly, we used Bert base uncased for the initial experiments. We further fine-tuned these embeddings with a two way attention mechanism from the knowledge base to the asked question and from the asked question to the knowledge base answer aspects. Our method is based on a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture with a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to represent the asked question dynamically in multiple aspects. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the Bert pre-trained language model embeddings for question answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known embedding methods.},

  abstract={Models are first-class elements in Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In this paradigm, the most widespread approaches adopted by the development community are Object-Oriented and ontological, formalized using Unified Modeling Language (UML) and Resource Description Framework (RDF), respectively. However, Object Management Group (OMG) does not provide a specific standard language for validating UML models against Object Constraints Language (OCL) constraints; meanwhile, World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has defined Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL) as a standard validation language. Although the transformation between UML and RDF can be performed at the structural level, no effort has been made to transform OCL to SHACL. This paper addresses the transformation of OCL and text-based constraints to SHACL shapes in the context of Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES), a UML-based standard for electric utilities in Europe. This paper presents several contributions to the software engineering community. First, solving the validation problem in a standardized way. Second, facilitating European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) the construction of an ontology associated with the CGMES standard. Third, allowing developers to integrate the two complementary approaches. Finally, Promoting the adoption and integration of the ontological approach in the software community.},

  abstract={Remote-controlled or autonomous multi-rotor air vehicles, or drones, have become common and commercially available even to individual consumers, mostly for imaging purposes. Drones appeal to mission architects looking to extend the toolbox provided to operators performing challenging missions such as public safety operations. However, careful analysis of the operational context and concept of operations must take place before major acquisitions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model-based operational architecture definition framework, which is based on the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) ontology and uses Object Process Methodology (OPM) as its underlying modeling language. Through careful mapping of DoDAF Operational Viewpoint (OV) ontology to OPM ontology, we were able to show that the entire OV ontology can be covered by a small set of objects, processes, relations among them, and constructs comprising them. We then show how to instantiate the ontology to create a model of an actual architecture of interest (AoI) while maintaining strong typing of the model elements to ensure validity, integrity, consistency, and continuous compliance with the OV. We demonstrate our approach on the case of using drones in public safety enterprises for the purpose of crowd management in massively attended events and locations. The proposed framework allows for capturing ConOps and OpsCon in a lightweight, yet robust and consistent manner, and improve communication and concept validation between operational stakeholders and enterprise architects.},

  abstract={With the rapid growth of Web services, the demand for discovering the optimal services to satisfy the users' requirements is no longer an easy task. The critical issue in the process of service discovery is to conduct a similarity calculation. To solve such an issue, this study proposes an effective approach that combines the Embeddings from Language Models (ELMo) representation and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to obtain a more accurate similarity score for retrieving target Web services. More specifically, first, the study adopts the ELMo model to generate effective word representations for capturing the sufficient information from services and queries. Then, the word representations are used to compose a similarity matrix, which will be taken as the input for the CNN to learn the matching relationships. Finally, the combination of the ELMo representation and CNN is used to address the representation and interaction processes within the matching task to improve the service discovery performance. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach for retrieving better targeted Web services.},

By using the IoT, a BP can, e.g.: 1) take into account real-world data to take more informed business decisions, and 2) automate and/or improve BP tasks. To achieve these benefits, the integration of IoT and BPs needs to be successful. The first step to this end is to support the modeling of IoT-enhanced BPs. Although numerous researchers have studied this subject, it is unclear what is the current state of the art in terms of current modeling solutions and gaps. In this work, we carry out a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) to find out how current solutions are modelling IoT into business processes. After studying 600 papers, we identified and analyzed in depth a total of 36 different solutions. In addition, we report on some important issues that should be addressed in the near future, such as, for instance the lack of standardization.},

On the other hand, metamodel is a more classical, but more powerful model in which concepts and relationships are represented in a prescriptive way. This study firstly clarifies the difference between the two approaches, then explains their advantages and limitations, and attempts to explore a general ontological metamodeling framework by integrating each characteristic, in order to implement semantic simulation model engineering. As a proof of concept, this paper takes the combat effectiveness simulation systems as a motivating case, uses the proposed framework to define a set of ontological composable modeling frameworks, and presents an underwater targets search scenario for running simulations and analyzing results. Finally, this paper expects that this framework will be generally used in other fields.},

  abstract={Complex simulation systems often comprise multiple distributed simulators that need to interoperate and synchronize states and events. In many cases, the simulation logics which are developed by different teams with specific expertise, need to be integrated to build a complete simulation system. Thus, supporting composability and reusability of simulation functionalities with minimal integration and performance overhead is a challenging but required capability. Middleware for game engines are promising to realize both the modular and reusable development criteria as well as the high performance requirements, while data-centric publish/subscribe middleware can support seamless integration and synchronization of the distributed artifacts. However, differences in the level of abstraction at which these middleware operate and the semantic differences in their underlying ontologies make it hard and challenging for simulation application developers and system integrators to realize a complete, operational system. To that end this paper presents a model-driven approach to blending the two middleware, wherein the modeling capabilities provide intuitive and higher-level abstractions for developers to reason about the composition and validation of the complete system, and the generative capabilities address the inherent and accidental complexities incurred in reconciling the semantic differences between the gaming and pub/sub middleware. We present a concrete implementation of our approach and illustrate its use and performance results using simple use cases.},

  abstract={Designing a software system that applied the microservice architecture style is a challenging task, as its characteristics are vulnerable to various security attacks. Software architect, therefore, needs to pinpoint the security flaws in the design before the implementation can proceed. This task is error-prone as it requires manual analysis on the design model, to identify security threats and trace possible attack scenarios. This paper presents an automated security analysis approach for microservice architecture. Our approach can automatically identify security threats according to a collection of formally defined security characteristics and provide an insightful result that demonstrates how the attack scenarios may happen. A collection of formally defined security characteristics can be extended to support other security characteristics not addressed in this paper.},

  abstract={Image captioning is the task of generating textual descriptions of a given image, requiring techniques of computer vision and natural language processing. Recent models have utilized deep learning techniques for this task to gain performance improvement. However, these models can neither fully use information included in a given image such as object and attribute, nor generate a domain-specific caption because existing methods use open dataset such as MSCOCO which include general images. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a domain-specific image caption generator, which generates a caption based on attention mechanism with object and attribute information, and reconstruct a generate caption using a semantic ontology to provide natural language description for given specific-domain. To show the effectiveness of the proposed model, we evaluate the image caption generator with a dataset, MSCOCO, quantitatively and qualitatively.},

  pages={8034-8038},
  abstract={In a task-oriented dialog system, the goal of dialog state tracking (DST) is to monitor the state of the conversation from the dialog history. Recently, many deep learning based methods have been proposed for the task. Despite their impressive performance, current neural architectures for DST are typically heavily-engineered and conceptually complex, making it difficult to implement, debug, and maintain them in a production setting. In this work, we propose a simple but effective DST model based on BERT. In addition to its simplicity, our approach also has a number of other advantages: (a) the number of parameters does not grow with the ontology size (b) the model can operate in situations where the domain ontology may change dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that our BERT-based model outperforms previous methods by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the standard WoZ 2.0 dataset 1. Finally, to make the model small and fast enough for resource-restricted systems, we apply the knowledge distillation method to compress our model. The final compressed model achieves comparable results with the original model while being 8x smaller and 7x faster.},

  year={2020},
  volume={17},

  pages={1250-1265},
  abstract={Software-intensive cyber-physical systems (CPS) perform essential tasks such as controlling automated production processes in industrial production plants. The required levels of autonomy, openness, and self-adaptation, as well as the dynamic nature of the context of such CPS, result in challenging tasks for their engineering. During operation, unexpected situations in which the system has insufficient knowledge about the current state of the system itself as well as its context may occur. Engineering CPS, e.g., for industrial production sites, must account for such uncertainties the system will have to cope with during its lifetime in a structured and systematic way. Since the development of CPS requires consideration of different system perspectives, current uncertainty modeling approaches cannot be applied right away, as they do not explicitly consider uncertainty aspects that affect different artifacts. To aid the engineering of CPS, this article presents a model-based approach to document uncertainty. We propose “Orthogonal Uncertainty Models,” which closely integrate with other engineering artifacts from different perspectives, as a means for capturing a dedicated uncertainty viewpoint. Our approach has been evaluated in the industry automation domain. The application shows that the idea of regarding uncertainty within a dedicated perspective is highly beneficial. Particularly, our approach helps to uncover and document uncertainties related to behavioral, functional, and structural properties of a system, as well as uncertainties related to business models that would otherwise possibly remain covert. Note to Practitioners-Identifying and documenting uncertainties, which may occur during operation of a system, is a common problem in engineering processes. Such uncertainties may lead to severe damage, and thus need to be mitigated appropriately. It is crucial to account for these uncertainties during engineering, especially in the early phases. Depending on the specific project characteristics, a multitude of different diagram types are used to model a system. Uncertainties thus reflect in many artifacts, which leads to: 1) redundancies in the specified uncertainty attached to diagram elements and 2) uncertainty information (e.g., about the cause or effect of uncertainty) that is spread across different diagrams. The latter makes it difficult to structure uncertainty information and trace it throughout the engineering process so that uncertainty can be systematically considered. Our approach provides a graphical modeling language that employs a dedicated perspective on uncertainty in separate diagrams that can be linked to any engineering artifact.},

As a result, the integration of these diverse constituents poses key challenges such as task for identifying interactions of components to be synthesized for a function in the systems. Although existing studies such as ontology and integration semantic languages have been used for specifying interactions of components in a Cyber-Physical System, these are still not applicable to discover the component interactions in collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems. It is due to the fact that functionalities of Cyber-Physical Systems are generally realized through interactions among multiple systems in a collaborative environment. This paper proposes a model interaction language, CyPhyML+ which can identify component interactions of realized functions in collaborative Cyber-Physical Systems.

  abstract={Object-oriented modeling is concerned with capturing common properties of objects. The dominant thinking in this realm is to classify objects that share certain properties into what is called a class, which in turn enables us to instantiate additional objects. Deep modeling takes a step further by introducing the notion of clabject that might be instantiated multiple times until its instantiation potency runs out. This initiative has gained a lot of momentum of late, primarily due to the inadequacy of the classical mechanics of two-level object instantiation. There exists a less familiar way of reasoning in object-orientation that takes its root from the prototype theory. We believe that they co-exist as two sides of the same coin. Unfortunately, prototype-based modeling still stays on the sidelines in the mainstream of conceptual modeling and related areas (e.g., enterprise modeling). In this paper, we argue that the two methods actually complement each other. We propose a hybrid modeling suite that allows for both instantiation and cloning in enterprise modeling. We formally state that a clabject not only features the so-called potency (i.e., for how many levels this clabject might further be classified) but also carries the notion of characteristics (i.e., the extent to which this clabject resembles those being represented). We demonstrate our novel ways of modeling for capturing business processes in a service-oriented enterprise architecture.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a growth in the use of reference conceptual models to capture information about complex and critical domains. However, as the complexity of domain increases, so does the size and complexity of the models that represent them. Over the years, different techniques for complexity management in large conceptual models have been developed. In particular, several authors have proposed different techniques for model abstraction. In this paper, we leverage on the ontologically well-founded semantics of the modeling language OntoUML to propose a novel approach for model abstraction in conceptual models. We provide a precise definition for a set of Graph-Rewriting rules that can automatically produce much-reduced versions of OntoUML models that concentrate the models' information content around the ontologically essential types in that domain, i.e., the so-called Kinds. The approach has been implemented using a model-based editor and tested over a repository of OntoUML models.},

Due to the heterogeneous nature of data on the semantic web, entities belonging to different sources are compared by assessing the similarity of features that are common in order to identify matches. With the increasing size of data sets Candidate generation methods are generally employed to avoid quadratic time complexity that would otherwise be incurred if pairwise similarity of all entities are computed. Here we propose a novel index based approach for candidate generation and reduction. The evaluation shows that the proposed method scales well and improves recall significantly.},

We illustrate our approach with the example of the development of Electric Vehicle Testbeds (EVTs), i.e. systems for testing high-voltage electric vehicle components. Companies in the electric vehicle industry (automobile, aircraft and rail vehicle manufacturers) mainly use such systems. Like many other mechatronic systems, EVTs are typically tailor-made solutions. Our approach automates manual development steps and can thus contribute to quality improvement, development time reduction and finally cost reduction.},

  abstract={In this paper, a process improvement approach, which provides automated assistance in designing and developing Inference Enterprise Models (IEM), is described. An IEM forecasts and evaluates the performance of the modeled enterprise and can be used to improve the operational quality of an enterprise making mission-focused inferences. As part of developing the IEM methodology, a team of researchers built several Inference Enterprise Models and acquired a breadth of knowledge in the domain of modeling insider threat detection systems. Although there are many different ways this type of inference enterprise can be modeled, there are common elements that are reused from case to case. We propose a solution for formalizing and reusing this IEM domain knowledge by developing an IEM Process Ontology and Workflow Generator.},

  abstract={In recent years, while the Internet has brought various technological evolutions, a lot of ontology is required to organize and systemize knowledge, and its generation is necessary. Especially, classification of hypernym-hyponym relation which describes taxonomy of ontology has received a lot of attention. As a method to automate the generation, word embedding based method was proposed recently. Although the method enabled high accuracy classification by using semantics, it does not correspond to complex term consisting of multiple words. Based on this background, in this paper, we proposed a new model combined word embedding and Recurrent Neural Network(RNN), evaluated the classification performance with data extracted from WordNet. For the result, it is indicated that the RNN approach is more effective and general for ontology generation.},

  abstract={Business is looking for technological and investment possibilities in research and development (R&D). Here the basic problems are to find R&D's results and/or teams for solving the professional tasks and for making investment. But business has no personal view on scientific problems. So business is seeking the objective tools for forecasting and evaluation of R&D prospects and results. Experts have own interests and require a lot of funding. R&D reflections are the texts. The modern methods of computer analysis of texts can do a lot of the experts' work for making it more objective and cheaper. The tools for search, systematization and ranking R&D's results and teams are computer analysis of texts and the map of science. The map of science is the distribution of the collection of texts of a scientific nature by the topics. The map of science is a way to navigate through the world of scientific publications and R&D's teams, a tool for identifying trends and assessing R&D directions. The usual ways for the map of science formation use bibliometric/scientometric data, general probability models of the texts, expert's opinion or artificial intelligence (AI) models and methods based on the thesaurus or on the ontology of the subject domains. The interests of business are not in line with the orientation on a priori established ideas about possible topics or there number for rapidly changing scientific fields. Precisely these fields are of the greatest interest to business. On the basis of mathematical modeling of texts and large-scale text collections, an approach is proposed for the computational formation of the adaptive dynamic map of science that does not use a priori classification schemes and data of the scientific publications' citation. Topics (thematic groups), their number and the distribution of texts over the topics are determined computationally without experts' involvement. Examples of the maps of science for various collections of scientific publications are given. The original method is proposed for checking the adequacy of the text models and the map of science. The method uses the categorization of articles and their abstracts as the separate objects on the basis of computationally generated map (its topics). The results of the large-scale experiment confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed mathematical modeling of texts and text collections. The possibilities of practical use of the map of science for business applications are considered.},

System architects are always trying to find easier, complex and more united way of information system development. Although the Model Driven Architecture (MDA) provides a set of guidelines for the structuring of specifications it also comes with challenging tasks of transformations between the various levels of abstraction. The primary objective of this work is to design a universal automated approach within the Computer Independent Model (CIM) and Platform Independent Model (PIM) manual transformation. The manual process of the transformations within MDA could be automated using ontology model with the combination of mapping rules and Extensible Markup Process Definition Language (XPDL) and Extensible Markup Language Metadata interchange (XMI) conversion.},

  title={A Novel Framework to Automatically Generate Executable Web Services From BPMN Models}, 
  year={2019},
  volume={7},
  number={},
  pages={93653-93677},
  abstract={Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is a business process management system in which integrated applications are used to manage business processes in a shared data environment. ERP systems usually deal with the two types of business processes, i.e., exchange and conversion. In the exchange process, economic resource, such as product, exchanges to another economic resource, such as the sales process. In a conversion process, an enterprise consumes resources in order to produce new resources, such as the distribution process. Generally, the communication between ERP applications, based on the conversion and exchange processes, is accomplished through Web services. In this context, the implementation of Web services in ERP systems is a complex task. To manage this, the business process model and notation (BPMN) are frequently utilized to simplify the development of ERP applications. However, state-of-the-art BPMN approaches usually deal with the modeling of exchange processes without considering the conversion process. Furthermore, the model transformation solution to automatically generate Web services from the BPMN models are hard to find in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed that supports the modeling of both exchanges as well as conversion processes through BPMN. Particularly, a modeling approach is introduced to represent the ERP processes through BPMN concepts. Subsequently, the rules are developed to convert source BPMN models into target Service-oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) models. Finally, transformation rules are developed to generate fully functional executable Java Web services from SoaML models. As a part of the research, a complete open-source BPMN to Web services transformation (B2W) tool is developed to automatically generate the Web services from the high-level BPMN models. The proposed framework is validated through multiple case studies. The experimental results prove that the proposed framework accurately generates Web services from the BPMN models, which eventually helps in developing the ERP systems with simplicity.},

Analyzing requirements correctly and creating design model sequentially could be critical to the whole process of a product development. Nevertheless, requirement text handling and model transferring could be really time-consuming and error-prone. Thus, we proposed an artificial intelligence based framework to deal with textual requirement handling and model creation. With deep learning and natural language process skills, our approach could be able to analyze textual requirements automatically, and then create the related models. This would indeed alleviate the work of engineers and promote the efficiency and quality of product development process.

  abstract={The integration of IoT infrastructures across production systems, together with the extensive digitalisation of industrial processes, are drastically impacting manufacturing value chains and the business models built on the top of them. By exploiting these capabilities companies are evolving the nature of their businesses shifting value proposition towards models relying on product servitization and share, instead of ownership. In this paper, we describe the semantic data-model developed to support a digital platform fostering the reintroduction in the loop and optimization of unused industrial capacity. Such data-model aims to establish the main propositions of the semantic representation that constitutes the essential nature of the ecosystem to depict their interactions, the flow of resources and exchange of production services. The inference reasoning on the semantic representation of the ecosystem allows to make emerge nontrivial and previously unknown opportunities. This will apply not only to the matching of demand and supply of manufacturing services, but to possible and unpredictable relations. For instance, a particular kind of waste being produced at an ecosystem node can be linked to the requirements for an input material needed in a new product being developed on the platform, or new technologies can be suggested to enhance processes under improvement. The overall architecture and individual ontologies are presented and their usefulness is motivated via the application to use cases.},

  abstract={The Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) is a general modeling formalism with sound semantics founded on a system theoretic basis. It can be used as a base for the development of specialized modeling formalisms. Usually, the extensions of DEVS expand the classes of systems models that can be represented in DEVS. However, with a growing number in new variants of DEVS and an increasing number of problems to be solved using discrete simulation techniques, it is necessary to define the relations among different approaches. This paper presents a conceptual modeling perspective applied to DEVS extensions that structure a framework over the traditional modeling and simulation approach. The framework provides a multilevel structure to analyze the features required for each extension type. Two main types of extensions are identified: variants and subclasses. In order to illustrate the proposed guidelines, the Routed DEVS formalism is presented as example of the subclass type.},

  abstract={Digital twins (DTs) are a powerful mechanism for representing complex industrial assets such as oil platforms as digital models. These models can facilitate temporal analyses and computer simulations of assets. In order to enable this, DTs should be able to capture characteristics of an asset as specified by the manufacturer, its state during the run time, as well as how the asset interacts with other assets in a complex system. We argue that semantic technologies and in particular semantic models or ontologies is promising modelling paradigm for DTs. Semantic models allow to capture complex systems in an intuitive fashion, can be written in standardised ontology languages, and come with a wide range of off-the-shelf systems to design, maintain, query, and navigate semantic models. In this work we report our preliminary results on developing a system that would support semantic-based DTs. In particular, we plan to augment the PI System developed by OSIsoft with ontologies and show how the resulting solution can help in simplifying analytical and machine learning routines for DTs.},

  abstract={Business process and requirement specification are crucial phases in the software development process. Yet, business and requirement modeling are often carried out separately by different languages and design teams, leading to misaligned models. The degree of misalignment grows continuously with their independent evolution. Thus, the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully exploited. There is a considerable agreement among researchers about the integration technique roles to bridge the gap between heterogeneous models. Therefore, this approach is based on this technique to align the business world represented by BPMN and the software requirement world represented by the UML use case. We define an integrated meta-model that incorporates all BPMN and use case elements as well as new others to map traceable elements. Further, we define a new diagram that provides a means to visualize and combines their use within an integrated model. Our approach supplements CASE tools with additional information and relationships to maintain the global system consistency. To illustrate it, we implement an editor for designing the proposed diagram, and we apply it in a topical case study.},

Software-defined networking (SDN) has provided many network solutions in the electrical counterpart. SDN for optical networks can provide new opportunities to make the above mentioned tasks easier and faster. As a first step towards this goal, we develop an optical network description language (ONDL). We use it to describe various network components, and their configuration and run-time states, such as modulation schemes, wavelength and spectral-width of a transponder, switching matrix of an optical switch etc. The language is based on resource description framework (RDF). Furthermore, we develop a controller which understands and sends instructions in this language to different network devices to provide/change their states. We show the applicability of ONDL by simulating a network, controlling and managing its nodes using ONDL and developed controller.},

  year={2018},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={160-169},
  abstract={Nowadays, the usefulness of the formal verification and validation of system specifications is well established, at least for critical systems. However, one of the main obstacles to their adoption lies in obtaining the formal specification of the system, and, in the case of refinement-based formal methods such as B System or Event-B, in obtaining the most abstract specification that heads the development of the system. The SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method is proposed to overcome this difficulty. It includes a goal modeling language to model requirements from stakeholders needs. Translation rules from a goal model to a B System specification have already been defined. They allow to obtain a skeleton of the system specification. To complete it, a language has been defined to express the domain model associated to the goal model. Its translation gives the structural part of the B System specification. However, it very often appears that new elements must be added in the B System specification obtained from SysML/KAOS models, discovered for instance when specifying the body of events and/or by using formal validation and/or verification tools. We have therefore defined a set of rules allowing the back propagation, within domain models, of every newly added element. This paper describes these rules and how they are specified in Event-B. Their consistency is proved using the Rodin tool. We show that they are structure preserving: two related elements within the B System specification remain related within the domain model. This is done by proving various isomorphisms between the B System specification and the domain models.},

Our main contributions are: to develop a refactoring technique related to the correct by construction approach; to use the domain specific knowledge in a system model explicitly; to define a set of modelling patterns; and to define a restructuring mechanism in the formal development. Finally, this proposed approach is evaluated through a complex medical case study: ECG clinical assessment protocol.},

Industry 4.0 sets the foundations for a completely connected factories that are characterized by the digitization and interconnection of supply chains, production equipment and production lines, and the application of the latest advanced digital information technologies to manufacturing activities. To fully realize the promise of Industry 4.0, disparate manufacturing systems, devices, data and processes need to connect, communicate, and interoperate. This paper has dual purpose. It first introduces a model-based engineering that enables a concurrent, collaborative design process where users examine and define requirements, propose solution architectures, demonstrate and exchange ideas with stakeholders, and consider product feature tradeoffs. Subsequently, it proposes a novel programming paradigm and a flexible environment that helps developers develop design-to-production industrial automation solutions by employing structured higher-level modular software techniques.},

  abstract={The industrial cyber-physical production system contains a variety of heterogeneous devices and models, which increase the complexity of system design, particularly in software programming. Although the proposed model-driven engineering (MDE) is applied to industrial automation for this issue, the inherent complex dependencies and constraints between models and the availability of suitable tools for code generation limit the application of the model-driven approach in practice, especially as the system becomes more enormous. The component-based design (CBD) approach, which is a bottom-up approach, in contrast to the MDE that is top-down, is proposed to manage the complexity of software aspect based on the idea that building a system from existing components instead of the scratch.

This paper presents an integrated design approach based on the combination of CBD and MDE to realize auto-design for cyber-physical production systems.},

  abstract={Nowadays Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) applications are increasingly successful in the air traffic (ATC) domain. Paramount to achieving this is collecting enough data for speech recognition model training. Thousands of hours of ATC communication are recorded every day. However, the transcription of these data sets is resource intense, i.e. writing down the sequence of spoken words, and more importantly, interpreting the relevant semantics. Many different approaches including CPDLC (Controller Pilot Data Link Communications) currently exist in the ATC community for command transcription, a fact that e.g. complicates exchange of transcriptions. The partners of the SESAR funded solution PJ.16-04 are currently developing on a common ontology for transcription of controller-pilot communications, which will harmonize integration of ASR into controller working positions. The resulting ontology is presented in this paper.},

  abstract={The concept of resource and value in the archimate that is too general allows for modeling and communication problems. Therefore, an ontological analysis is needed to evaluate and redesign the concept of resource and value on the archimate. In this paper, Unified foundational ontology (UFO) is used in conducting an ontological analysis on the concept of resource and value. An ontological analysis is done by considering the mapping between the concept on Archimate and ontology concept on UFO. Semantic problems in resource and value concepts are found when the ontological analysis is performed. The result of this study is Archimate extension with the improvement of resource and value concept. The resulting extension was successfully applied in case studies and was able to handle semantic problems that were identified.},

  abstract={Due to the rapid increase of intermittent energy resources (IERs), there is a need to have dispatchable production available to ensure secure operation and increase opportunity for energy system flexibility. Gas turbine-based power plants offer flexible operation that is being improved with new technology advancements. Those plants provide, in general, quick start together with significant ramping capability, which can be exploited to balance IERs. Consequently, to understand the potential source of flexibility, better models for gas turbines are required for power system studies and analysis. In this paper, both the required semantic information and physical behavior models of such multi-domain systems are considered. First, UML class diagrams and RDF schemas based on the common information model standards are used to describe the semantic information of the electrical power grid. An extension that exploits the ISO 15926 standard is proposed herein to derive the multi-domain semantics required by integrated electrical power grid with detailed gas turbine dynamic models. Second, the Modelica language is employed to create the equation-based models, which represent the behavior of a multi-domain physical system. A comparative simulation analysis between the power system domain model and the multi-domain model has been performed. Some differences between the turbine dynamics representation of the commonly used GGOV1 standard model and a more detailed gas turbine model are shown.},

  abstract={Social Internet-of-Things (SIoT) environment comprises not only smart devices but also the humans who interact with these IoT devices. The benefits of such system are overshadowed due to the cyber security issues. A novel approach is required to understand the security implication under such a dynamic environment while taking both the social and technical aspects into consideration. This paper addressed such challenges and proposed a 3-D security modeling platform that can capture and model the security requirements in the SIoT environment. The modeling process is graphical notation based and works as a security extension to the Business Process Model and Notation. Still, it utilizes the latest 3-D game technology; thus, the security extensions are generated through the third dimension. Consequently, the introduction of security extensions will not increase the complexity of the original SIoT scenario, while keeping all the key information on the same platform. Together with the proposed security ontology, these comprehensive security notations created a unique platform that aims at addressing the ever complicated security issues in the SIoT environment.},

  abstract={Risk analysis is a complex and critical activity in various contexts, ranging from strategic planning to IT systems operation. Given its complexity, several Enterprise Architecture (EA) frameworks and modeling languages have been developed to help analysts in representing and analyzing risks. Yet, the notion of risk remains overloaded and conceptually unclear in most of them. In this paper, we investigate the real-world semantics underlying risk-related constructs in one of such approaches, namely ArchiMate's Risk and Security Overlay (RSO). We perform this investigation by means of ontological analysis to reveal semantic limitations in the overlay, such as ambiguity and missing constructs. Building on the results of this analysis, we propose a well-founded redesign of the risk modeling aspects of the RSO.},

  year={2018},
  volume={6},

  pages={63890-63904},
  abstract={Due to the high popularity of Twitter, spammers tend to favor its use in spreading their commercial messages. In the context of detecting twitter spams, different statistical and behavioral analysis approaches were proposed. However, these techniques suffer from many limitations due to: 1) ongoing changes to Twitter's streaming API which constrains access to a user's list of followers/followees; 2) spammer's creativity in building diverse messages; 3) use of embedded links and new accounts; and 4) need for analyzing different characteristics about users without their consent. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel ontology-based approach for spam detection over Twitter during events by analyzing the relationship between ham user tweets versus spams. Our approach relies solely on public tweet messages while performing the analysis and classification tasks. In this context, ontologies are derived and used to generate a dictionary that validates real tweet messages from random topics. Similarity ratio among the dictionary and tweets is used to reflect the legitimacy of the messages. Experiments conducted on real tweet data illustrate that message-to-message techniques achieved a low detection rate compared with our ontology-based approach which outperforms them by approximately 200%, in addition to promising scalability for large data analysis.},

  abstract={Requirements elicitation requires extensive knowledge and deep understanding of the problem domain where the final system will be situated. However, in many software development projects, analysts are required to elicit the requirements from an unfamiliar domain, which often causes communication barriers between analysts and stakeholders. In this paper, we propose a requirements ELICitation Aid tool (ELICA) to help analysts better understand the target application domain by dynamic extraction and labeling of requirements-relevant knowledge. To extract the relevant terms, we leverage the flexibility and power of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in dynamic modeling of natural language processing tasks. In addition to the information conveyed through text, ELICA captures and processes non-linguistic information about the intention of speakers such as their confidence level, analytical tone, and emotions. The extracted information is made available to the analysts as a set of labeled snippets with highlighted relevant terms which can also be exported as an artifact of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The application and usefulness of ELICA are demonstrated through a case study. This study shows how pre-existing relevant information about the application domain and the information captured during an elicitation meeting, such as the conversation and stakeholders' intentions, can be captured and used to support analysts achieving their tasks.},

  abstract={In recent years, several goal modeling approaches have been used and extended to capture the complexity of legal requirements and help modeling them in notations familiar to the requirements engineers and analysts. Legal-GRL, which is an extension of the Goal-oriented Requirements Language (GRL), is used for modeling and analyzing legal requirements. However, creating Legal-GRL models is still a manual process, which limits its effectiveness and scalability. In this paper, we propose a new goal modeling framework based on GRL to facilitate the automation of the legal requirements modeling process. Our FOL-based Legal-GRL (FLG) framework uses a legal ontology, which entails a modal theory and First-order Logic (FOL) approach, for the purpose of extraction, refinement, and representation of legal requirements. Our FLG framework consists of a database design and a set of methods for automating the modeling process. We evaluate our work by modeling several statements from HIPAA, PHIPA, the EU GDPR and EU-US Privacy Shield.},

  abstract={In this paper, the challenges of maintaining a healthy IT operational environment have been addressed by proactively analyzing IT Service Desk tickets, customer satisfaction surveys and social media data. A Cognitive solution goes beyond the traditional structured data analysis solutions by deep analyses of both structured and unstructured text. The salient features of the proposed platform include language identification, translation, hierarchical extraction of the most frequently occurring topics, entities and their relationships, text summarization, sentiments and knowledge extraction from the unstructured text using Natural Language Processing techniques. Moreover, the insights from unstructured text combined with structured data allows the development of various classification, segmentation and time-series forecasting use-cases on incident, problem and change datasets. The text and predictive insights together with raw data are used for visualization and exploration of actionable insights on a rich and interactive dashboard. However, it is hard not only to find these insights using traditional Analytics solutions but it might also take very long time to discover them, especially while dealing with massive amount of unstructured data. By taking actions on these insights, organizations can benefit from significant reduction of ticket volume, reduced operational costs and increased customer satisfaction. In various experiments, on average, up to 18-25 % of yearly ticket volume has been reduced using the proposed approach.},

This implies shifting from a traditional view of manufacturing processes focused on production line in order to reduce costs, to a more flexible and customized product manufacturing. On the other hand, Multi Agent Systems (MAS) have been proved to be a suitable way to fulfill these requirements. However, a key aspect of the use of novel technologies is to offer methodologies and tools for supporting the implementation of such systems. In this sense, this paper uses Model Driven Engineering and MAS technology to propose an architecture that is able to launch and execute a manufacturing execution plan. It focuses on the information models managed by architecture agents that can be customized to particular manufacturing plants as well as on the definition of agent templates.},

  abstract={Business models (BM) describe mechanisms of value creation, delivery and capture. Business Model Representation (BMRs) in terms of conceptual models systematically and formally visualize BMs. The field of BMRs is characterized by conceptual inconsistencies such as heterogeneous notations and insufficiently described semantics. Describing and constructing structured and comparable BMs capturing concrete business cases is hampered. Even the success of the most prominent BMR approach - the business model canvas (BMC) - could only lead to slight advances. So, we aim to mature research on BMRs by enhancing the BMC with further conceptual modeling's concepts. We will focus on Health Information Technology (HIT) initiatives that are prone to fail. Analyses showed that the domain's networked nature of value creation requires to link and interrelate the BM's building blocks. Current BMR approaches, including the BMC, can only hardly provide such. For addressing BMC's conceptual weaknesses, we propose to substantiate the BMC by means of a layered concept making use of conceptual modeling's principles and considering the domain's specifics to a greater extent. Systematic and HITspecific BM(R) approaches are worthwhile as these identify and map all relevant stakeholders as well as their interrelations for value creation. That is a primary prerequisite for sustainable HIT solutions. So, we aim at bringing necessary complex information into a structured concept that allows to make profound managerial decisions. In turn, this provides more profound guidance for the implementation of HIT solutions that may lead to a higher success rates of such.},

  abstract={Providing reminders to elderly people in their home environment, while they perform their daily activities, is considered as a user support activity, and thus a relevant topic in Active and Assisted Living (AAL) research and development. Determining such reminders implies decision-making, since the actions' flow (behavior) usually involves probabilistic branches. An automated system needs to decide which of the next actions is the best one for the user in a given situation. Problems of this nature involve uncertainty levels that have to be dealt with. Many approaches to this problem exploit statistical data only, thus ignoring important semantic data as, for instance, are provided by Ontologies. However, ontologies do not support reasoning over uncertainty natively. In this paper, we present a probabilistic semantic model that enables reasoning over uncertainty without losing semantic information. This model will be exemplified by an extension of the Human Behavior Monitoring and Support [HBMS] approach that provides a conceptual model for representing the user's behavior and its context in her/his living environment. The performance of this approach was evaluated using real data collected from a smart home prototype equipped with sensors. The experiments provided promising results which we will discuss regarding limits and challenges to overcome.},

  abstract={In recent years, there has been a growth in the use of reference conceptual models, in general, and domain ontologies, in particular, to capture information about complex and critical domains. These models play a fundamental role in different types of critical semantic interoperability tasks. Therefore, it is essential that domain experts are able to understand and reason using the models' content. In other words, it is important that conceptual models are cognitively tractable. However, it is unavoidable that when the information of the represented domain grows, so does the size and complexity of the artifacts and models that represent them. For this reason, more sophisticated techniques for complexity management in ontology-driven conceptual models, need to be developed. Some approaches are based on the notion of model modularization. In this paper, we follow the work on model modularization to present an approach for view extraction for the ontology-driven conceptual modeling language OntoUML. We provide a formal definition for ontological views over OntoUML conceptual models that completely leverages on the ontologically well-grounded real-world semantics of that language. Moreover, we present a plug-in tool, particularly developed for an OntoUML model-based editor that implements this formal view structure in terms of queries defined over the OntoUML metamodel embedded in that tool.},

  abstract={Cyber-physical systems that interact with each other and form groups to achieve joint goals, are referred to as collaborative cyber-physical systems. They are exposed to highly dynamic and open contexts only partly known at design time. While model-based systems engineering already helped overcome various challenges regarding the development of conventional cyber-physical systems, challenges remain with respect to highly collaborative systems. This paper proposes an approach for modeling the context of collaborative cyber-physical systems and generating ontologies that they can use at runtime to communicate with each other and perform context-related reasoning. To account for the broad domain scope of such systems and unforeseeable future applications, the approach is not limited to a static set of prescribed ontological concepts. Instead, it facilitates the incorporation of custom concepts to meet the individual requirements of a broad spectrum of development projects concerned with collaborative cyber-physical systems.},

  abstract={The complexity of searching and indexing spoken document retrieval depends closely on content structure and access strategies. However, Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) approaches based on the transcription of content by LVCSR systems must treat the impact of recognition errors on the performance of the information retrieval system. Currently, several multimedia resources (spoken document) are unexploited, because the errors generated in the transcription process, decrease the performance of the systems of searches for spoken documents. Our contribution in this paper is the proposition a novel approach semantic based indexing content of multimedia documents by using the results of a partial automatic transcription to ride out research and indexing problems on these resources. In this context, the main hypothesis is developed around the following question: is it possible to identify and retrieve spoken document by using a semantic content indexing system based on his partial transcription? Also, does the partial content transcription of a spoken document is sufficient for his indexing? First, we are interested to look for a linguistic syntactic representation of the whole of the content spoken document. Then, it will be used to define the most discriminating indexing terms for his content. Nevertheless, in our approach, we have an assumption that the use of segments of a spoken document with an efficient semantic enrichment process instead of the whole spoken document content is sufficient. Also, with this strategy, we can resolve OOV problems, recognition errors and technical terms. Finally, in validation and experimentation phase, we tested the different modules proposed on the TED-LIUM corpora. The results obtained are interesting and encourage us to lead off our future perspectives.},

Derived requirements are represented formally in models that are used to produce dependability evidence using theorem proving, model-based test vector generation, test execution with code coverage analysis, and requirement-to-test traceability. To address the challenges of heterogeneity of modeling tools and languages, Semantic Web Technologies are used for model composition and model transformation from modeling tools to formal analysis tools.},

  abstract={State-of-the-art intelligent assistant systems such as Siri & Co. struggle with conditionals. They reliably react to ordinary commands. However, their architectures are not designed to cope with complex conditional queries. We propose a system to overcome these limitations. Our approach models if-then-else constructs in spoken utterances explicitly. The model bridges the gap between linguistic and programmatic semantics. To proof our concept, we apply a rule-based approach to extract conditionals. For our prototype we use part-of-speech and chunk tags provided by NLP tools. We make use of coreference information to determine the reference frame of a condition. The explicit modeling of conditionals allows us to evaluate the accuracy of our approach independently from other language understanding tasks. The prototype works well in the domain of humanoid robotics. In a user study we achieve F1 scores of 0.783 (automatic speech recognition) up to 0.898 (manual transcripts) on unrestricted utterances.},

  abstract={Software models are core artifacts in model driven engineering (MDE) and processable by computer. They are automatically transformed into other models and in MDE, programming code is also produced by the models. The automatic transformation provides a systematic reuse of existing artifacts. However, sometimes models are developed with defects and the defects can implicitly shift into the code, which may be difficult to discover and repair. A promising solution to this problem is model verification. UML class model is a key ingredient of MDE. However, UML only offers graphical components without the support of reasoning, due to lack of the formal foundation. Therefore, the verification of formal properties, such as consistency and finite satisfiability is not possible in UML. This paper proposes an ontology-based optimized verification method for important correctness property “finite satisfiability”of UML class model.},

  abstract={Interoperability is the capability of multiple parties and systems to collaborate and exchange information and matter to obtain their objectives. Interoperability challenges call for a model-based systems engineering approach. This paper describes a conceptual modeling framework for model-based interoperability engineering (MoBIE) for systems of systems, which integrates multilayered interoperability specification, modeling, architecting, design, and testing. Treating interoperability infrastructure as a system in its own right, MoBIE facilitates interoperability among agents, processes, systems, services, and interfaces. MoBIE is founded on ISO 19450 standard-object-process methodology, a holistic paradigm for modeling and architecting complex, dynamic, and multidisciplinary systems-and allows for synergistic integration of the interoperability model with system-centric models. We also discuss the implementation of MoBIE with the unified modeling language. We discuss the importance of interoperability in the civil aviation domain, and apply MoBIE to analyze the passenger departure process in an airport terminal as a case-in-point. The resulting model enables architectural and operational decision making and analysis at the system-of-systems level and adds significant value at the interoperability engineering program level.},

  abstract={The growing complexity of industrial automation demands the adoption of software engineering principles for improving the development process of control systems. This paper presents a methodological approach to the design and development of complex automation systems relying on model-driven engineering (MDE). A benefit of this approach is the integration of methods and techniques widespread within the automation discipline with modern MDE techniques guiding the designer through the development phases. A second advantage is to add flexibility enough to adapt the steps to the needs of the system under design. Finally, the architecture presented is prepared to be adapted to methodology extensions to cover other aspects of automation systems. The framework is based on domain models that are defined through the development phases using the terminology of the automation field. Using model transformations both documentation about system analysis and design and the skeleton of software units are automatically generated. A proof-of-concept tool has been developed that has been tested on the design of medium-complexity projects to assess the impact of its use with respect to project documentation and maintenance.Note to Practitioners—Control software development can be considered one of the challenges in automation field for achieving leadership in the future economic market. This work presents a model-driven engineering-based approach making use of both automation and software engineering methods and techniques for developing automation control systems. The framework implements the methodology for industrial automation systems ( ${\rm MeiA}_{\bullet }$ ) for guiding developers through the development phases and generates the analysis and design documentation using domain terminology, the design documentation that involves the minimal units of design, and the program organization units in one-to-one correspondence with the minimal units of design. From a practical point of view, it should be highly emphasized that developers of automation projects benefit from more structured designs, reduced number of errors, and improved project documentation.},
