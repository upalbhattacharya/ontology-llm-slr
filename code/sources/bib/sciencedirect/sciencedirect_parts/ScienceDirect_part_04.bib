This paper proposes a novel approach to give ontology-driven reasoning on predicted results by machine learning. Thus, we construct text embedding on the serious game data. Next, we use machine learning for prediction and DBpedia ontology for reasoning to analyze the enhancement in prediction results. We conduct a set of benchmarks using several well-known machine learning algorithms, leading to an accuracy of 97%.}

abstract = {Deep Learning (DL)-based visual analytic systems have demonstrated substantial potential in enhancing construction management. Yet, these systems should go beyond merely facilitating recognition-based tasks and strive to capture high-level semantics. While ontologies have emerged as foundational tools for semantic-enriched visual analytic systems, many existing application-oriented ontologies in the construction domain lack a comprehensive conceptualization and formalization of visual information, restricting their robustness and applicability. Furthermore, there is a notable gap in integrating low-level visual information and high-level semantics. To address these challenges, we introduce the Construction Semantic Enrichment ontology (ConSE). ConSE offers a formal representation of visual information relevant to construction site imagery. It is designed to support the development of semantic-enriched visual analytic systems in the construction domain. To evaluate the ontology, we implement an automated consistency-checking process internally. In addition, we execute three task-based use cases to validate the proposed ontology. The evaluation results demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of the ConSE, confirming its ability to bridge the identified research gaps and contribute to the advancement of semantic-enriched visual analytic systems in the construction domain.}

In the field of smart health services, semantic interoperability means the exchange and interpretation of data without ambiguity and uncertainty. However, existing classical ontologies are not able to represent vague and uncertain knowledge, especially in contexts of mental health disorders which are associated with varying degrees of uncertainty and inaccuracy of diagnosis, and in this case, the treatment is a complex and common mental process necessitating to share information accurately and unambiguously. Type-2 fuzzy set theory can offer a fruitful solution in order to control uncertainty or express ambiguous concepts in a dynamic and complex environment such as healthcare systems. Herein, a semantic framework for healthcare, and also monitoring mental health disorders using type-2 fuzzy set theory based on the Internet of Thing (IoT) is suggested, in which all depression-related concepts are semantically annotated to share detailed information with the treatment staff. This framework not only paved the way to increasing the accuracy of medical diagnosis and decision-making but also provides the possibility of inference and semantic reasoning using the languages of SPARQL query and DL query.}

The nature of how requirements are phrased and described in regulations often lacks a comprehensive and detailed description of one another. Interpreting complex interrelations from these sources requires the expertise of specialists. An automatic code compliance checking is hindered without interpretation and through the absence of a formalization of preventive fire safety domain knowledge. Moreover, the non-involvement of fire safety planners in earlier project phases and the absence of fire safety properties in commonly used building modelling software further complicate the matter. To address these issues, we developed an ontological knowledge formalization, the Fire Safety Ontology (FiSa), enabling the classification of buildings and their components based on fire safety considerations. Combining building codes, technical regulations, guidelines, and semi-structured interviews with fire safety planners, we put emphasis on a fire safety perspective for buildings. Subsequently, we related fire safety domain insights from experts to knowledge about building design from other domains, such as architecture. Through this collaborative effort and the instantiation of building data within the ontology, structural fire safety requirements from regulations were automatically inferred by reasoning with common inference engines, simulating an automatic compliance checking. Our results demonstrate the contribution of ontology knowledge formalization to the integration process.}

The variation in gall phenotypes is extraordinary across species but usually predictable for each species of inducer. We introduce here a new ontology, GallOnt, that facilitates consistent descriptions and the semantic representation of and reasoning over plant gall phenotype data. GallOnt was largely developed from ontologies in the Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry and stands to connect plant gall phenotypes to knowledge derived from model plant systems, including genotype-phenotype and agricultural research. We also introduce the idea of a new gall data standard — Minimum Information for the Description of Galls (MIDG version 0.1) — as a starting point for discussions regarding cecidology best practices.}

We also discuss the expansion of the ontology with the levels of design decomposition of a complex system, to support the management of traceability of the FMEA across the design process.

A tuning-free approach is proposed that integrates LLMs with a Nested Contract Knowledge Graph (NCKG) using a Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) framework for contract knowledge retrieval and reasoning. Tested on international EPC contracts, the method achieves more accurate risk evaluation and interpretable risk summaries than baseline models. These findings demonstrate the potential of combining LLMs and KGs for reliable reasoning in tasks that are knowledge-intensive and specialized, such as contract review.}

These obstacles include: (1) most data on the trophic interactions and feeding behaviour of soil organisms being scattered across disparate repositories, without well-established standard for describing and structuring trophic datasets; (2) the existence of various competing terms, rather than consensus, to delineate feeding-related concepts such as diets, trophic groups, feeding processes, resource types, leading to ambiguities that hinder meaningful data integration from different studies; (3) considerable divergence in the trophic classification of numerous soil organisms, or even the lack of such classifications, leading to discrepancies in the resolution of reconstructed food webs and complicating the reuse and comparison of food-web models within synthetic studies. To address these issues, we introduce the Soil Food Web Ontology, a novel formal conceptual framework designed to foster agreement on the trophic ecology of soil organisms. This ontology represents a collaborative and ongoing endeavour aimed at establishing consensus and formal definitions for the array of concepts relevant to soil trophic ecology. Its primary objective is to enhance the accessibility, interpretation, combination, reuse, and automated processing of trophic data. By harmonising the terminology and fundamental principles of soil trophic ecology, we anticipate that the Soil Food Web Ontology will improve knowledge management within the field. It will help soil ecologists to better harness existing information regarding the feeding behaviours of soil organisms, facilitate more robust trophic classifications, streamline the reconstruction of soil food webs, and ultimately render food-web research more inclusive, reusable and reproducible.}

To describe methods to approach application of data standards to integrate social determinants of health (SDoH) into EHRs through evaluation of a case of clinical decision support for pediatric asthma.
Materials and Methods
We identified a list of environmental factors important for managing pediatric asthma. We identified and integrated data from local outdoor air quality monitors with elements available from the clinic’s EHR and self-reported indoor air quality questionnaire data. We assessed existing SDoH frameworks, assessment tools, and terminologies to identify representative data standards for these environmental SDoH measures.
Results
We found many-to-many relationships between the multiple framework domains, the environmental exposure measures collected, and existing standards. The majority of concepts did not accurately align with environmental exposure measurements. We propose an ontology-driven information framework methodology to apply standards for SDoH measurements to support measuring, managing, and computing SDoH data.
Discussion
To support methods of integrating SDoH data in the EHR via an ontology-driven information framework, a common SDoH ecosystem should be developed descriptively and prescriptively integrating framework domains, assessment tools, and standard ontologies to support future data sharing, aggregation, and interoperability. A hierarchical object-oriented information model should be adopted to manage SDoH to extend beyond patient-centered orientation of EHRs to orient to households and communities.
Conclusion
SDoH data pose unique challenges and opportunities in collecting, measuring, and managing health information. Future work is needed to define data standards for implementing SDoH in a hierarchical, object-oriented information model representing multiple units of orientation including individuals, households, and communities.}

MOODY is designed to be particularly applicable in automatic algorithm configuration, which involves the search of the parameters of an optimization algorithm to optimize its performance. In this context, we observe a notable absence of standardized components, parameters, and related considerations, such as problem characteristics and algorithm configurations. This lack of standardization introduces difficulties in the selection of valid component combinations and in the re-use of algorithmic configurations between different algorithm implementations. MOODY offers a means to infuse semantic annotations into the configurations found by automatic tools, enabling efficient querying of the results and seamless integration across diverse sources through their incorporation into a knowledge graph.

This study proposes an ontology-based semantic GIS conceptual framework that can seamlessly combine ontology models, GIS elements and user actions for semantic GIS application development. In addition, a GIS components ontology that encompasses the five fundamental components of GIS is proposed to integrate GIS elements that can perceive GIS operations and processes semantically and to support customized GIS system designs.

abstract = {Summary
Background
Navigating the clinical literature to determine the optimal clinical management for rare diseases presents significant challenges. We introduce the Medical Action Ontology (MAxO), an ontology specifically designed to organize medical procedures, therapies, and interventions.
Methods
MAxO incorporates logical structures that link MAxO terms to numerous other ontologies within the OBO Foundry. Term development involves a blend of manual and semi-automated processes. Additionally, we have generated annotations detailing diagnostic modalities for specific phenotypic abnormalities defined by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). We introduce a web application, POET, that facilitates MAxO annotations for specific medical actions for diseases using the Mondo Disease Ontology.
Findings
MAxO encompasses 1,757 terms spanning a wide range of biomedical domains, from human anatomy and investigations to the chemical and protein entities involved in biological processes. These terms annotate phenotypic features associated with specific disease (using HPO and Mondo). Presently, there are over 16,000 MAxO diagnostic annotations that target HPO terms. Through POET, we have created 413 MAxO annotations specifying treatments for 189 rare diseases.
Conclusions
MAxO offers a computational representation of treatments and other actions taken for the clinical management of patients. Its development is closely coupled to Mondo and HPO, broadening the scope of our computational modeling of diseases and phenotypic features. We invite the community to contribute disease annotations using POET (https://poet.jax.org/). MAxO is available under the open-source CC-BY 4.0 license (https://github.com/monarch-initiative/MAxO).

abstract = {Speakers of Eastern Tukanoan languages in Brazil and Colombia construe linguistic differences as indices of group identity, intrinsic to a complex ontology in which language is a consubstantial, metaphysical product—a 'substance' in the development of the person. Through speech, speakers of the same language signal a corporality based in theories of shared ancestry and mutual belonging while speakers of different languages signal difference. For Tukanoans, then, one creates one’s self in the act of speaking. These ontological beliefs underlie speech practices, influencing language maintenance and contributing to one of the most extreme examples of multilingualism reported in the literature.}

This study aims to focus on the interpretation component of Peirce’s triadic model of sign to identify: the components affecting the interpretation of an object and the components affecting the meaning creation by people for use in ontologies. Ashura was selected because it is a historical event and a meaningful sign in Iranian religious culture.
Design/methodology/approach
This qualitative study was conducted in two steps. In the first step, the Instagram pages of five groups of people were chosen as the sample and examined using qualitative content analysis. In the second step, 18 creators of Ashura works were selected, their lived experience in creating these works was collected using in-depth semi-structured interviews and analysed through phenomenology method.
Findings
Based on the results, the concept is context-oriented; one cannot interpret the signs according to one’s personal preferences because the context, social rules and habits limit this interpretation. Accordingly, the use of reference systems and rules of logic, as well as artificial intelligence and computer science tools alone cannot help represent meaning in ontologies. Rather, individual characteristics, contexts, presuppositions and components existing in personal, social and technological worlds are effective on concept formation and meaning creation. Thus, these factors must be considered in ontology, especially for multi-faceted and context-oriented concepts, such as Ashura.
Originality/value
This research adopted a new approach and method to study ontology. This study focused on interpretation and adopted Peirce’s sign model for ontology design.}

Simultaneously, recognizing and considering part deformation during operational usage also plays a critical role, exerting a profound impact on component performance, reliability, and safety throughout its operational lifecycle. Traditional approaches have often dealt with each of these two phenomena independently, leading to fragmented understanding and ineffective solutions. To bridge this gap, a novel ontology is proposed to address the intricate relationship between different types of part deviation during manufacturing processes, as well as the possibility of part deformations throughout operational usage, while emphasizing their significance in tolerance analysis. By integrating knowledge from various domains, including engineering design, manufacturing, and materials science, the ontology facilitates a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing part deviations. Furthermore, the ontology considers the probabilities of part deformations during the operational life, encompassing factors such as loading conditions, environmental exposure, and thermal fluctuations. By leveraging this ontology, engineers and researchers can better predict, assess, and manage the effects of geometrical part variation on product performance, resulting in improved design robustness, manufacturing efficiency, and operational reliability.}

To address this issue, we propose a methodology that represents heterogeneous organization data in a high-level space by combining them into single ontology represented by knowledge graph. The graph is constructed autonomously using semi-structured data from various sources. Our method identifies links between sources based on several similar metric between keys sets of each collection. Then document collections are combined into merged entities if collections’ key sets are similar. The experiments demonstrate the applicability of the developed approach for constructing a knowledge graph based on partially structured data from various sources, performing with high F1 measure (0.8 on average) when compared to the expert markup.}

abstract = {Background
Novel surveillance approaches using digital technologies, including the Internet of Things (IoT), have evolved, enhancing traditional infectious disease surveillance systems by enabling real-time detection of outbreaks and reaching a wider population. However, disparate, heterogenous infectious disease surveillance systems often operate in silos due to a lack of interoperability. As a life-changing clinical use case, the COVID-19 pandemic has manifested that a lack of interoperability can severely inhibit public health responses to emerging infectious diseases. Interoperability is thus critical for building a robust ecosystem of infectious disease surveillance and enhancing preparedness for future outbreaks. The primary enabler for semantic interoperability is ontology.
Objective
This study aims to design the IoT-based management of infectious disease ontology (IoT-MIDO) to enhance data sharing and integration of data collected from IoT-driven patient health monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and disparate heterogeneous infectious disease surveillance.
Methods
The ontology modeling approach was chosen for its semantic richness in knowledge representation, flexibility, ease of extensibility, and capability for knowledge inference and reasoning. The IoT-MIDO was developed using the basic formal ontology (BFO) as the top-level ontology. We reused the classes from existing BFO-based ontologies as much as possible to maximize the interoperability with other BFO-based ontologies and databases that rely on them. We formulated the competency questions as requirements for the ontology to achieve the intended goals.
Results
We designed an ontology to integrate data from heterogeneous sources, including IoT-driven patient monitoring, clinical management of individual patients, and infectious disease surveillance systems. This integration aims to facilitate the collaboration between clinical care and public health domains. We also demonstrate five use cases using the simplified ontological models to show the potential applications of IoT-MIDO: (1) IoT-driven patient monitoring, risk assessment, early warning, and risk management; (2) clinical management of patients with infectious diseases; (3) epidemic risk analysis for timely response at the public health level; (4) infectious disease surveillance; and (5) transforming patient information into surveillance information.
Conclusions
The development of the IoT-MIDO was driven by competency questions. Being able to answer all the formulated competency questions, we successfully demonstrated that our ontology has the potential to facilitate data sharing and integration for orchestrating IoT-driven patient health monitoring in the context of an infectious disease epidemic, clinical patient management, infectious disease surveillance, and epidemic risk analysis. The novelty and uniqueness of the ontology lie in building a bridge to link IoT-based individual patient monitoring and early warning based on patient risk assessment to infectious disease epidemic surveillance at the public health level. The ontology can also serve as a starting point to enable potential decision support systems, providing actionable insights to support public health organizations and practitioners in making informed decisions in a timely manner.}

The feasibility and effectiveness of CEMO were demonstrated through a case study, showcasing its utility in carbon intensity calculation and evaluation of earned carbon value. CEMO facilitates seamless integration of data from disparate sources, enabling real-time and automated management of onsite carbon emissions as well as disclosure of carbon-related information.}

abstract = {Due to the widespread presence of knowledge in factories, integrating various types of knowledge to solve different tasks in industrial production processes, including prediction, diagnosis, and control tasks, is of great significance and challenging. Knowledge graph, as a method of knowledge representation, holds significant promise for addressing challenges within industrial contexts. However, current research on knowledge graph has a limitation in that task related knowledge graph focus on structure information, while ignoring semantic and logical information in knowledge. Additionally, the existing ontologies designed for industrial production lack adaptability to cater to the diverse needs of different industrial tasks. This paper proposes a multi-level knowledge graph defined by ontology to introduce semantics and further explore the methods for combining semantics to complete practical industrial tasks. To ensure the accurate sampling of heterogeneous nodes, four semantic templates are generated using if-then rule logic. Different kinds of neighbor nodes are defined through the if-then rule logic, leading to a accelerated generation of target subgraphs related to different tasks. In this way, the plant-wide distributed computing for fault diagnosis tasks can be easily realized. Furthermore, this paper introduces a framework for semantics extraction and graph embedding based on multi-information fusion. This framework integrates semantic information, structural information, and node attribute information within the graph to deliver a holistic feature representation for prediction and control tasks. We take blast furnace ironmaking process as an industrial case study and the experimental results demonstrate the crucial role of semantics in enhancing the knowledge expression capability of graphs. Based on the blast furnace simulation experiment platform, the proposed method achieves 92.76% accuracy in the blast furnace fault diagnosis task, and the diagnosis time is reduced by 58.44% compared with the traditional rule-based method. In the self-healing control task of the blast furnace, the proposed graph embedding method can achieve a complete control process in three types of blast furnace faults: blowing out, tuyere failure, and low stockline. The control effect can be comparable to manual operation.}

This research addresses this gap by presenting a conceptualised model for understanding corrosion detection through ontology development. This is implemented in an ontology development environment using Protege 5.5.0 and ELK 0.5.0 reasoner. Evaluation is done using expert competency questions and hypothetical scenarios thereby establishing a robust framework that is beneficial to Engineering design in terms of terminology standardisation, design process facilitation, and building corrosion inspection systems that are interoperable. The Ontology also enables sharing and reusing knowledge between automated corrosion detection systems as well as integration with existing industrial standards such as Industrial Ontology Foundry (IOF) and semantic web standards. Hence, offering a significant contribution to the digitalisation of engineering design. Besides the enhancement of damage detection, this work also advances the engineering field to utilise visual data more effectively in design, maintenance, and product lifecycle management.}

One key challenge is the abundance of domain-specific terminology, which an LLM is not trained to extract in accordance with the underlying physical laws. Such black-box models can also lead to unreliable results or hallucinations. Hybrid AI, which combines data-driven and symbolic methods, leverages domain knowledge to add explainability and reliability to answers. Our group has previously developed a domain-informed ontology-based information extraction tool called SUSIE, which extracts key terms and their context to present them to the user as knowledge graphs (KGs). Although KGs are used to visualize relationships between different entities, they are not easily accessible for user questions. However, they serve as a structured input for LLMs. Thus, KGs can efficiently query a corpus of pharmaceutical documents, streamlining drug discovery and manufacturing processes. In this work, we propose methods to improve the information extraction capabilities of SUSIE by expanding its knowledge base and improving its ability to understand scientific material through a sentence-restructuring module. Additionally, we present a customized question-and-answer module that enables the user to query from generated KGs and get an answer in natural language. Unlike black-box models such as those purely powered by OpenAI’s models and the LangChain GraphQA packages, combining our KGs with Neo4j limits hallucinations and provides reliable and traceable answers in a user-friendly chatbot interface.}

On the other hand, graph-based methods can obtain embeddings of clinical concepts from ontologies, but they cannot obtain embeddings for clinical terms and words. In this paper, a novel method is presented to obtain embeddings for clinical terms and words from the SNOMED CT ontology. The method first obtains embeddings of clinical concepts from SNOMED CT using a graph-based method. Next, these concept embeddings are used as targets to train a deep learning model to map clinical terms to concepts embeddings. The learned model then provides embeddings for clinical terms and words as well as maps novel clinical terms to their embeddings. The embeddings obtained using the method out-performed corpus-based embeddings on the task of predicting clinical term similarity on five benchmark datasets. On the clinical term normalization task, using these embeddings simply as a means of computing similarity between clinical terms obtained accuracy which was competitive to methods trained specifically for this task. Both corpus-based and ontology-based embeddings have a limitation that they tend to learn similar embeddings for opposite or analogous terms. To counter this, we also introduce a method to automatically learn patterns that indicate when two clinical terms represent the same concept and when they represent different concepts. Supplementing the normalization process with these patterns showed improvement. Although clinical term embeddings obtained from SNOMED CT incorporate ontological knowledge which is missed by corpus-based embeddings, they do not incorporate linguistic knowledge which is needed for sentence-based tasks. Hence combining ontology-based embeddings with corpus-based embeddings is an avenue for future work.}

These benefits critically depend on the provision of a suitable ontology. We observe the context of supporting requirement analysis provides both opportunities and restrictions when choosing the most appropriate ontology retrieval mechanisms. Requirement models are the basis for retrieving the most influential ontologies and are not the typical retrieval domain ontologies. For instance, a retrieval ontology derived from the requirement is not expected only to be a hierarchical taxonomy, nor is it limited to the boundaries of a single domain, nor does it cover any particular domain completely. Hence, retrieval methods cannot be based on classes only and computational constraints do not necessarily apply as the retrieval process is expected to run only once at the outset of the analysis phase. It is also important to assume that the retrieval in this context is targeting multiple ontologies describing multiple but related domains. In this paper, we deduce that avoiding structural based retrieval mechanisms in fact benefits to the requirement models. Instead, we formulate a new retrieval method based on the PageRank algorithm that takes into account the indirect influences of various concepts within plausible supporting ontologies. This paper provides an empirical analysis that evidences the strength of our retrieval algorithm in supporting the identification of ontologies to support requirement analysis.}

Notably, the latter is usually forbidden in expressive description logics. As the main contribution, we show decidability of ontology-mediated query answering in that setting and establish tight complexity bounds, namely 2ExpTime-completeness in combined complexity and coNP-completeness in data complexity. Since the lower bounds are inherited from the fragment ALC, we concentrate on providing upper bounds. As main technical tools we establish a tree-like countermodel property and a characterization of when a query is not satisfied in a tree-like interpretation. Together, these results allow us to use an automata-based approach to query answering.}

Even if English is the leading language for international communication, it is essential to keep in mind that research runs at the local level by local teams generally communicating in their local/national language, especially in Europe among European projects.
Objective
Therefore, the European Federation for Medical Informatics - Working Group on Health Informatics for Inter-regional Cooperation” has one objective: To develop a multilingual ontology focusing on Health Informatics and Digital Health as a collaboration tool that improves international and, in particular, European collaborations.
Results
We have developed the Medical Informatics and Digital Health Multilingual Ontology (MIMO). Hosted on the Health Terminology/Ontology Portal (HeTOP), MIMO contains around 1,000 concepts, 460 MeSH Descriptors, 220 MeSH Concepts, and more than 300 newly created concepts. MIMO is continuously updated to comprise as recent as possible concepts and their translations in more than 30 languages. Moreover, the MIMO’s development team constantly improves MIMO content and supporting information. Thus, during workshop discussions and one-on-one exchanges, the MIMO team has collected domain experts’ opinions about the community’s interests and suggestions for future enhancements. Moreover, MIMO will be integrated to support the annotation and categorization of research products into the HosmartAI European project involving more than 20 countries around Europe and worldwide.
Conclusion
MIMO is hosted by HeTOP (Health Terminology/Ontology Portal), which integrates 100 terminologies and ontologies in 55 languages. MIMO is freely available online. MIMO is portable to other knowledge platforms as part of MIMO’s main aims to facilitate communication between medical librarians, translators, and researchers as well as to support students’ self-learning.}

Automatic ontological relation extraction from text is an important factor for representing documents and their contents in a useful computerized manner. This paper proposes a model for automatic ontology extraction from Arabic text by parsing sentences and extracting part of speech (POS). Then, the proposed rule-based model is applied to extract the triple attributes of a sentence (subject, predicate, and object) from the parsing tree. Finally, the semantic relations can be used to extract new triples inferred from the initially extracted triples. The results were evaluated using two methods: the first method was based on a comparison with manual extraction because there is no standard method for measuring Arabic triple extraction; the second method is based on translating the dataset into English and comparing the output results using the Stanford dependencies extraction web tool. The proposed model achieved an accuracy of 73.6% for Arabic triple extraction and a 35% increase in overall triples owing to new inferred triples. However, when the dataset was translated into English and tested by the Stanford dependencies extraction web tool, the accuracy was 71.8% without inferred triples.}

The pigeon swarm optimization algorithm is applied to optimize the performance of the Dendritic Neural Network approach for hyperparameter tuning. The experimental evaluation of the proposed method occurs utilizing a web database, and the outcomes are studied under various aspects.

abstract = {Introduction
Patient safety classifications/ontologies enable patient safety information systems to receive and analyze patient safety data to improve patient safety. Patient safety classifications/ontologies have been developed and evaluated using a variety of methods. The purpose of this review was to discuss and analyze the methodologies for developing and evaluating patient safety classifications/ontologies.
Methods
Studies that developed or evaluated patient safety classifications, terminologies, taxonomies, or ontologies were searched through Google Scholar, Google search engines, National Center for Biomedical Ontology (NCBO) BioPortal, Open Biological and Biomedical Ontology (OBO) Foundry and World Health Organization (WHO) websites and Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Science Direct. We updated our search on 30 February 2021 and included all studies published until the end of 2020. Studies that developed or evaluated classifications only for patient safety and provided information on how they were developed or evaluated were included. Systems with covered patient safety terms (such as ICD-10) but are not specifically developed for patient safety were excluded. The quality and the risk of bias of studies were not assessed because all methodologies and criteria were intended to be covered. In addition, we analyzed the data through descriptive narrative synthesis and compared and classified the development and evaluation methods and evaluation criteria according to available development and evaluation approaches for biomedical ontologies.
Results
We identified 84 articles that met all of the inclusion criteria, resulting in 70 classifications/ontologies, nine of which were for the general medical domain. The most papers were published in 2010 and 2011, with 8 and 7 papers, respectively. The United States (50) and Australia (23) have the most studies. The most commonly used methods for developing classifications/ontologies included the use of existing systems (for expanding or mapping) (44) and qualitative analysis of event reports (39). The most common evaluation methods were coding or classifying some safety report samples (25), quantitative analysis of incidents based on the developed classification (24), and consensus among physicians (16). The most commonly applied evaluation criteria were reliability (27), content and face validity (9), comprehensiveness (6), usability (5), linguistic clarity (5), and impact (4), respectively.
Conclusions
Because of the weaknesses and strengths of the development/evaluation methods, it is advised that more than one method for development or evaluation, as well as evaluation criteria, should be used. To organize the processes of developing classification/ontologies, well-established approaches such as Methontology are recommended. The most prevalent evaluation methods applied in this domain are well fitted to the biomedical ontology evaluation methods, but it is also advised to apply some evaluation approaches such as logic, rules, and Natural language processing (NLP) based in combination with other evaluation approaches. This research can assist domain researchers in developing or evaluating domain ontologies using more complete methodologies. There is also a lack of reporting consistency in the literature and same methods or criteria were reported with different terminologies.}

abstract = {Jazz is a musical tradition that is just over 100 years old; unlike in other Western musical traditions, improvisation plays a central role in jazz. Modelling the domain of jazz poses some ontological challenges due to specificities in musical content and performance practice, such as band lineup fluidity and importance of short melodic patterns for improvisation. This paper presents the Jazz Ontology – a semantic model that addresses these challenges. Additionally, the model also describes workflows for annotating recordings with melody transcriptions and for pattern search. The Jazz Ontology incorporates existing standards and ontologies such as FRBR and the Music Ontology. The ontology has been assessed by examining how well it supports describing and merging existing datasets and whether it facilitates novel discoveries in a music browsing application. The utility of the ontology is also demonstrated in a novel framework for managing jazz related music information. This involves the population of the Jazz Ontology with the metadata from large scale audio and bibliographic corpora (the Jazz Encyclopedia and the Jazz Discography). The resulting RDF datasets were merged and linked to existing Linked Open Data resources. These datasets are publicly available and are driving an online application that is being used by jazz researchers and music lovers for the systematic study of jazz.}

To deal with such a volatile environment, different software tools are available to simulate, study, test, and support the decisions of the various entities involved in the sector. However, being developed for specific subdomains of PES, these tools lack interoperability with each other, hindering the possibility to achieve more complex and complete simulations, management, operation and decision support scenarios. This paper presents the Intelligent Energy Systems Ontology (IESO), which provides semantic interoperability within a society of multi-agent systems (MAS) in the frame of PES. It leverages the knowledge from existing and publicly available semantic models developed for specific domains to accomplish a shared vocabulary among the agents of the MAS society, overcoming the existing heterogeneity among the reused ontologies. Moreover, IESO provides agents with semantic reasoning, constraints validation, and data uniformization. The use of IESO is demonstrated through a case study that simulates the management of a distribution grid, considering the validation of the network’s technical constraints. The results demonstrate the applicability of IESO for semantic interoperability, reasoning through constraints validation, and automatic units’ conversion. IESO is publicly available and accomplishes the pre-established requirements for ontology sharing.}

Therefore, this research examines the development and evaluation of ontology-based recommender systems. The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments.}

Most of the existing approaches used to design secure NoSQL databases are limited to the final implementation stage, and do not involve the design of security and access control issues at higher abstraction levels. Ensuring security and access control for Graph-based databases is difficult, as each approach differs significantly depending on the technology employed. In this paper, we propose the first technology-ascetic framework with which to design secure Graph-based databases. Our proposal raises the abstraction level by using ontologies to simultaneously model database and security requirements together. This is supported by the TITAN framework, which facilitates the way in which both aspects are dealt with. The great advantages of our approach are, therefore, that it: allows database designers to focus on the simultaneous protection of security and data while ignoring the implementation details; facilitates the secure design and rapid migration of security rules by deriving specific security measures for each underlying technology, and enables database designers to employ ontology reasoning in order to verify whether the security rules are consistent. We show the applicability of our proposal by applying it to a case study based on a hospital data access control.}

This study aims to develop an FFH-specific knowledge graph (FFH-KG) to support FPS design. By structuring accident data, the FFH-KG provides empirical insights to help designers improve FPS frameworks, aiding safety planning and decision-making. It serves as a decision support system for FPS designers and safety professionals, guiding the selection and design of appropriate protection solutions for diverse WAH scenarios. The FFH-KG was constructed using a hybrid natural language processing approach, combining manual extraction, entity recognition, text segmentation, and rule-based relation extraction. It was grounded in a schema layer (i.e., ontology) established by experts. A text-mining approach, integrating machine learning with a large language model, facilitated the categorization of fall types, refinement of WAH scenarios, and identification of fall causes, enhancing the content and applicability of knowledge graph. A total of 2,200 entities and 4,820 relationships were created based on fall protection equipment standard documents and fall-from-height accident investigation reports, forming a foundation for developing countermeasures. The retrieval performance of FFH-KG was validated through three case studies. This research has also made significant progress in intelligent safety engineering and management across industries.}

abstract = {Objective
To develop the FuseLinker, a novel link prediction framework for biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs), which fully exploits the graph’s structural, textual and domain knowledge information. We evaluated the utility of FuseLinker in the graph-based drug repurposing task through detailed case studies.
Methods
FuseLinker leverages fused pre-trained text embedding and domain knowledge embedding to enhance the graph neural network (GNN)-based link prediction model tailored for BKGs. This framework includes three parts: a) obtain text embeddings for BKGs using embedding-visible large language models (LLMs), b) learn the representations of medical ontology as domain knowledge information by employing the Poincaré graph embedding method, and c) fuse these embeddings and further learn the graph structure representations of BKGs by applying a GNN-based link prediction model. We evaluated FuseLinker against traditional knowledge graph embedding models and a conventional GNN-based link prediction model across four public BKG datasets. Additionally, we examined the impact of using different embedding-visible LLMs on FuseLinker’s performance. Finally, we investigated FuseLinker’s ability to generate medical hypotheses through two drug repurposing case studies for Sorafenib and Parkinson’s disease.
Results
By comparing FuseLinker with baseline models on four BKGs, our method demonstrates superior performance. The Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Area Under receiver operating characteristic Curve (AUROC) for KEGG50k, Hetionet, SuppKG and ADInt are 0.969 and 0.987, 0.548 and 0.903, 0.739 and 0.928, and 0.831 and 0.890, respectively.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates that FuseLinker is an effective novel link prediction framework that integrates multiple graph information and shows significant potential for practical applications in biomedical and clinical tasks. Source code and data are available at https://github.com/YKXia0/FuseLinker.}

abstract = {Objective:
This study introduces a novel tokenisation methodology, K-Tokeniser, to infuse clinical knowledge into language models for clinical text processing.
Methods:
Technically, at initialisation stage, K-Tokeniser populates global representations of tokens based on semantic types of domain concepts (such as drugs or diseases) from either a domain ontology like Unified Medical Language System or the training data of the task related corpus. At training or inference stage, sentence level localised context will be utilised for choosing the optimal global token representation to realise the semantic-based tokenisation. To avoid pretraining using the new tokeniser, an embedding initialisation approach is proposed to generate representations for new tokens.
Results:
Using three transformer-based language models, a comprehensive set of experiments are conducted on four real-world datasets for evaluating K-Tokeniser in a wide range of clinical text analytics tasks including clinical concept and relation extraction, automated clinical coding, clinical phenotype identification, and clinical research article classification. Overall, our models demonstrate consistent improvements over their counterparts in all tasks. In particular, substantial improvements are observed in the automated clinical coding task with 13% increase on Micro F1 score. Furthermore, K-Tokeniser also shows significant capacities in facilitating quicker convergence of language models.
Conclusion:
Models built using K-Tokeniser have shown faster convergence. Specifically,the language models would only require 50% of the training data to achieve the best performance of the baseline tokeniser using all training data in the concept extraction task and less than 20% of the data for the automated coding task. It is worth mentioning that all these improvements require no pre-training process, making the approach generalisable. Code availability: Our full implementation is openly available at https://github.com/abulhasanbbk/K-Tokenizer.}

Relations among objects get embedded as object properties, whereas the category of an object as a class. Features and attributes of objects encode the data properties of the ontology. The proposed ontology is compared with existing multimedia ontologies and evaluated with regard to its capability to represent relations occurring in benchmark datasets, demonstrating the completeness and thorough coverage of the domain concepts. Spatial reasoning rules are established using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) rules, and information retrieval is demonstrated using Description Logic (DL) and SPARQL queries. The proposed NLP-guided ontology generation approach is general enough to help in the development of ontologies for other domains as well, by providing video and textual data of the domain of interest, with limited human involvement.}

However, their adoption in business applications is still limited, with existing Ontology Engineering Methodologies (OEMs) lacking adequate support during knowledge elicitation, authoring and reuse phases. This paper introduces a novel agile ontology engineering methodology (AgiSCOnt) to support ontologists (especially novice ones) in ontology development workflow, fostering collaboration with domain experts in an iterative, flexible and customizable approach. AgiSCOnt combines macro-level instructions with micro-level guidance, leveraging existing techniques and a management framework to help novice ontologists throughout the whole ontology engineering process. The methodology is compared to existing OEMs and assessed with three other agile methodologies (UPONLite, SAMOD, and RapidOWL). The evaluation is conducted with a sample of novice ontologists in a learning environment on Industry 4.0 technologies. Both the development process with a methodology from a user perspective and the quality of the developed ontologies were considered in the evaluation. Preliminary results show that AgiSCOnt effectively supports authoring and reuse, with developed ontologies of good quality. It is perceived as clear and simple, while being flexible and adaptable enough, thus supporting knowledge management and sharing in industrial organizations through the documentation of the ontologies.}

abstract = {Although industrial automation has advanced significantly at the level of manufacturing units and production lines, system-level automation remains constrained by the limited cognitive abilities of current manufacturing systems. To address this challenge, this work proposes a cognitive agent (CA) that leverages a large language model (LLM) as its core to facilitate self-aware manufacturing. The cognitive capabilities of CA are facilitated through the combination of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and in-context learning. RAG allows CA to retrieve relevant subgraphs from an industrial knowledge graph (IKG) after interpreting natural language commands, thereby establishing focused context awareness and autonomously generating executable manufacturing instructions. Meanwhile, in-context learning enables CA to adapt to specific requirements based on contextual examples without retraining. These techniques empower CA with domain-specific cognition, fostering self-awareness in a flexible and cost-effective manner. Two case studies on pick-and-place and disassembly validate CA's effectiveness in task planning within a lab-scale manufacturing unit. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach surpasses traditional LLM-based methods in task executability and goal achievement, offering a novel perspective on advancing manufacturing systems.}

abstract = {Background
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a chronic condition among the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, representing a burden on health care systems. Scientific literature highlights that nutrition is pivotal in respiratory inflammatory processes connected to COPD, including exacerbations. Patients with COPD have an increased risk of developing nutrition-related comorbidities, such as diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and malnutrition. Moreover, these patients often manifest sarcopenia and cachexia. Therefore, an adequate nutritional assessment and therapy are essential to help individuals with COPD in managing the progress of the disease. However, the role of nutrition in pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) programs is often underestimated due to a lack of resources and dedicated services, mostly because pneumologists may lack the specialized training for such a discipline.
Objective
This work proposes a novel knowledge-based decision support system to support pneumologists in considering nutritional aspects in PR. The system provides clinicians with patient-tailored dietary recommendations leveraging expert knowledge.
Methods
The expert knowledge—acquired from experts and clinical literature—was formalized in domain ontologies and rules, which were developed leveraging the support of Italian clinicians with expertise in the rehabilitation of patients with COPD. Thus, by following an agile ontology engineering methodology, the relevant formal ontologies were developed to act as a backbone for an application targeted at pneumologists. The recommendations provided by the decision support system were validated by a group of nutrition experts, whereas the acceptability of such an application in the context of PR was evaluated by pneumologists.
Results
A total of 7 dieticians (mean age 46.60, SD 13.35 years) were interviewed to assess their level of agreement with the decision support system’s recommendations by evaluating 5 patients’ health conditions. The preliminary results indicate that the system performed more than adequately (with an overall average score of 4.23, SD 0.52 out of 5 points), providing meaningful and safe recommendations in compliance with clinical practice. With regard to the acceptability of the system by lung specialists (mean age 44.71, SD 11.94 years), the usefulness and relevance of the proposed solution were extremely positive—the scores on each of the perceived usefulness subscales of the technology acceptance model 3 were 4.86 (SD 0.38) out of 5 points, whereas the score on the intention to use subscale was 4.14 (SD 0.38) out of 5 points.
Conclusions
Although designed for the Italian clinical context, the proposed system can be adapted for any other national clinical context by modifying the domain ontologies, thus providing a multidisciplinary approach to the management of patients with COPD.}

Attempts to use BIM tools to CH have shown the limits of the ability to correctly represent and transmit information, especially on cultural value and conservation activities, and on the presence of available objects, due to the lack of specific content in IFC, which means a lack of interoperability. The provision of ontologies is necessary to allow interoperability. Ontologies permit the conceptualization of a representative model of reality by defining classes, attributes, and relationships that describe a domain. The research experiments and proposes a flowchart to connect a specific ontological model for Cultural Heritage in a BIM environment.

To enhance the production capabilities of the aquaponics system and maximize crop yield on a commercial level, integration of Industry 4.0 technologies is needed. Industry 4.0 is a strategic initiative characterized by the fusion of emerging technologies such as big data and analytics, internet of things, robotics, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. The realization of aquaponics 4.0, however, requires an efficient flow and integration of data due to the presence of complex biological processes. A key challenge in this essence is to deal with the semantic heterogeneity of multiple data resources. An ontology that is regarded as one of the normative tools solves the semantic interoperation problem by describing, extracting, and sharing the domains’ knowledge. In the field of agriculture, several ontologies are developed for the soil-based farming methods, but so far, no attempt has been made to represent the knowledge of the aquaponics 4.0 system in the form of an ontology model. Therefore, this study proposes a unified ontology model, AquaONT, to represent and store the essential knowledge of an aquaponics 4.0 system. This ontology provides a mechanism for sharing and reusing the aquaponics 4.0 system’s knowledge to solve the semantic interoperation problem. AquaONT is built from indoor vertical farming terminologies and is validated and implemented by considering experimental test cases related to environmental parameters, design configuration, and product quality. The proposed ontology model will help vertical farm practitioners with more transparent decision-making regarding crop production, product quality, and facility layout of the aquaponics farm. For future work, a decision support system will be developed using this ontology model and artificial intelligence techniques for autonomous data-driven decisions.}

Automated manufacturability analysis can reduce the number of iterations at the design stage. However, existing approaches that leverage design for manufacturing and assembly (DfMA) do not consider detailed product features and production capabilities. To address this limitation, this paper utilizes an ontology-based approach to connect design and manufacturing knowledge. The developed manufacturability analysis system (MAS) involves semantic reasoning to analyze manufacturability by combining feature-based modelling, production capability modelling and manufacturing rules. The system was tested on a timber panelized project to demonstrate complex manufacturability analysis capability. The testing proves that the system could provide real-time feedback to the designers, leading to fewer design iterations. Thus, the paper is a first step towards automated fabrication-aware design and the results from the study lay the foundation for future research on connecting knowledge for interdisciplinary rule checking}

This study aims to construct a knowledge graph for modeling CI protection. While the previous research has focused on threat intelligence modeling and open knowledge bases, they miss considering the defense side. Accordingly, we propose a knowledge graph for critical infrastructure protection, CIPKG, that extends the management ontology to include the defense side. It addresses the cross-industry and cross-time information gaps that occur in the process of CI protection management, making it more comprehensive in structure than the existing knowledge graph. We employ simplified Structured Threat Information Expression as attack ontology and design a new ontology for the defense side, which could combine with the existing threat ontology to form the CI protection knowledge graph. To dynamically extract information from emerging knowledge, we employ a Bi-directional Long Short-Term Memory and Conditional Random Field model with pre-trained cybersecurity domain-specific Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers to recognize the named entities from CI regulations and standards. To associate the threat part with the management portion of the knowledge graph, we adopt the Knowledge Graph Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model to capture the semantic information and predict the relationship between threat and management. After information extraction and relation prediction, we build a knowledge graph with 529,360 nodes and about 3,335,000 edges.}

abstract = {Types are fundamental for conceptual modeling and knowledge representation, being an essential construct in all major modeling languages in these fields. Despite that, from an ontological and cognitive point of view, there has been a lack of theoretical support for precisely defining a consensual view on types. As a consequence, there has been a lack of precise methodological support for users when choosing the best way to model general terms representing types that appear in a domain, and for building sound taxonomic structures involving them. For over a decade now, a community of researchers has contributed to the development of the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) - aimed at providing foundations for all major conceptual modeling constructs. At the core of this enterprise, there has been a theory of types specially designed to address these issues. This theory is ontologically well-founded, psychologically informed, and formally characterized. These results have led to the development of a Conceptual Modelling language dubbed OntoUML, reflecting the ontological micro-theories comprising UFO. Over the years, UFO and OntoUML have been successfully employed on conceptual model design in a variety of domains including academic, industrial, and governmental settings. These experiences exposed improvement opportunities for both the OntoUML language and its underlying theory, UFO. In this paper, we revise the theory of types in UFO in response to empirical evidence. The new version of this theory shows that many of OntoUML’s meta-types (e.g. kind, role, phase, mixin) should be considered not as restricted to substantial types but instead should be applied to model endurant types in general, including relator types, quality types, and mode types. We also contribute with a formal characterization of this fragment of the theory, which is then used to advance a new metamodel for OntoUML (termed OntoUML 2). To demonstrate that the benefits of this approach are extended beyond OntoUML, the proposed formal theory is then employed to support the definition of UFO-based lightweight Semantic Web ontologies with ontological constraint checking in OWL. Additionally, we report on empirical evidence from the literature, mainly from cognitive psychology but also from linguistics, supporting some of the key claims made by this theory. Finally, we propose a computational support for this updated metamodel.}

Freely available and easily accessible large online repositories are not indexed and are in an un-processable format. The major hindrance in developing and evaluating existing/new monolingual text in an image is that it is not linked and indexed. There is no method to reuse the online news images because of the unavailability of standardized benchmark corpora, especially for South Asian languages. The corpus is a vital resource for developing and evaluating text in an image to reuse local news systems in general and specifically for the Urdu language. Lack of indexing, primarily semantic indexing of the daily news items, makes news items impracticable for any querying. Moreover, the most straightforward search facility does not support these unindexed news resources. Our study addresses this gap by associating and marking the newspaper images with one of the widely spoken but under-resourced languages, i.e., Urdu. The present work proposed a method to build a benchmark corpus of news in image form by introducing a web crawler. The corpus is then semantically linked and annotated with daily news items. Two techniques are proposed for image annotation, free annotation and fixed cross examination annotation. The second technique got higher accuracy. Build news ontology in protégé using Ontology Web Language (OWL) language and indexed the annotations under it. The application is also built and linked with protégé so that the readers and journalists have an interface to query the news items directly. Similarly, news items linked together will provide complete coverage and bring together different opinions at a single location for readers to do the analysis themselves.}

The interplay between the building areas, the building elements involved in the deep renovation, and the renovation scenarios and activities present challenging situations for managing safety risks. Research on enhancing safety in building projects using digital approaches such as BIM has mainly focussed on new construction works, yet limited research is available for deep building renovation projects. Using a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology, this paper develops an ontology for representation and identification of hazards in deep building renovations, instantiates the ontology through the development of a digital tool, and demonstrates its usefulness in hazard representation and identification by performing tests with real industry data from deep renovation projects, as part of a Horizon Europe 2020 research project, called RINNO. The testing involved a multi-residence apartment case study and three different renovation scenarios and successfully demonstrated the ability to automatically identify potential hazards relating to a particular renovation strategy. While the proposed ontology can be used to reduce the risk of accidents and injuries in building retrofit projects, its main implication is in laying the foundation for future digitally enabled approaches for managing safety in building renovation projects.}

Then, we give an overview of popular ontology management tools.}

abstract = {Humans are able to estimate the depth of objects in their environment even using only one eye through the use of what are known as monocular cues. In this paper, we aim to integrate human knowledge and human-like reasoning used for monocular depth estimation within deep neural networks. The idea is to support the network in order to help it learn in an explicit and fast way the essential cues for the target task. For this purpose, we investigate the possibility of directly integrating geometric, semantic, and contextual information into the monocular depth estimation process. We propose exploiting an ontology model in a deep learning context to represent the urban environment as a structured set of concepts linked with semantic relationships. Monocular cues information are extracted through reasoning performed on the proposed ontology and are fed together with the RGB image in a multistream way into the deep neural network for depth estimation. Our approach is validated and evaluated on widespread benchmark datasets: KITTI, CityScapes, and AppolloScape. The obtained results show that the proposed method improves upon the state-of-the-art monocular depth estimation deep models and shows promising results regarding cross-evaluation, mainly for unseen driving scenarios.}

It aims to enhance care and quality of life for all patients, including those with a disability. However, when applied to the health sector, AI may be perceived as not transparent: the Explainable AI (xAI) paradigm attempts to solve this issue by providing more understandable, reliable, and human-interpretable AI-based applications. In a field such as disability – characterized by various impairments, limitations in performing activities, or other kinds of restrictions – the possibility to rely on computable representations of domain knowledge in the form of ontologies can support the development of xAI for healthcare. This work proposes a systematic literature review to identify which disabilities are currently represented in domain ontologies, examining which applicative contexts the ontologies were developed for. This review also investigates how the domain ontologies are modelled, underlining several relevant aspects that may foster their adoption in xAI systems. The review process results allow for shedding light on the main disabilities represented in ontologies, tracing the research trends that were at the basis of their development. Results also enable the identification of research lines that can support semantic interoperability – thus enabling ontologies to play a significant role in explaining decision processes performed by AI-based systems in healthcare.}

Observing the substantial literature on these platform types, both in academia and professional contexts, there is lack of consensus on the definition of these digital platform types. On top of that, there is a lack of knowledge in the literature on the requirements and design of these digital platform types. We address the observed lack of shared conceptualizations by creating a taxonomy for digital platforms, by classifying digital platforms according to their distinctive features. Further, we address the lack of design knowledge with a digital platform reference ontology that describes the construction and operation of the different types of digital platform that are distinguished in the taxonomy. This reference ontology, developed using the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and several of its core ontologies, is organized into different ontology modules, allowing to describe functionalities that are common to any digital platform and more specific functionalities that have their origin in the distinctive features that were used to construct the taxonomy. The taxonomy that we contribute helps to clearly define the different types of digital platform that can be observed today. It also helps analysing further evolutions in the platform domain. The contribution of a well-founded digital platform reference ontology is a step towards a better understanding of digital platform functionality, better communication between stakeholders, and eventually may facilitate future research and development of new types of digital platform.}

This system must ensure farming activities and monitoring procedures. This work concentrates on the farming activities such as pest control, disease protection, crop cultivation, treatment, etc, and their representation in the system. Ontology is used as a technology to represent the structured information in terms of concepts and the establishment of semantic relations among them. While many existing ontologies focus on agriculture management, the greenhouse domain lack comprehensive coverage, particularly in the operational farming activities that are necessary to ensure the agriculture sustainability. Therefore, there is a need to develop a greenhouse ontology-based system that address the stakeholders’ inquiries related to greenhouse construction and essential farming activities for greenhouse management. This paper presents a synthesis analysis of the existing ontologies in the domain of agriculture and greenhouses as well as a novel modular ontology that covers the greenhouse farming module.}

Furthermore, they are constrained by the professional backgrounds of their users, which hinders updates and communication. Therefore, the research constructed an “event-object-state” three-domain associated GDT-oriented KG, proposed a large language model (LLM) −driven KG dynamic update algorithm, and established a KG intelligent Q&A method integrating LLM. We developed a prototype system and selected an earthquake disaster as a typical geographic event for experimental analysis. The results showed that the proposed method can reflect the space, time, state, evolution process, and interrelationships of geographic entities in a more comprehensive way, support users to build, update, and query KGs using natural language, with an updating efficiency of less than 1 min, and an updating quality comparable to that of manual updating by experts. Compared with the traditional KGs, our method can represent virtual geographic entities and has significant advantages in intelligence and automation, which effectively breaks down professional barriers and supports the construction of GDTs with the need for rapid updating of knowledge.}

To enhance phenotype recognition in clinical notes of genetic diseases, we developed two models—PhenoBCBERT and PhenoGPT—for expanding the vocabularies of Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. While HPO offers a standardized vocabulary for phenotypes, existing tools often fail to capture the full scope of phenotypes due to limitations from traditional heuristic or rule-based approaches. Our models leverage large language models to automate the detection of phenotype terms, including those not in the current HPO. We compare these models with PhenoTagger, another HPO recognition tool, and found that our models identify a wider range of phenotype concepts, including previously uncharacterized ones. Our models also show strong performance in case studies on biomedical literature. We evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of BERT- and GPT-based models in aspects such as architecture and accuracy. Overall, our models enhance automated phenotype detection from clinical texts, improving downstream analyses on human diseases.}

This leads to a major problem concerning semantic interoperability. To address this issue, this paper introduces a Common Reference Ontology for Steelmaking (CROS). CROS serves as a shared steelmaking resource and capability model that aims to facilitate knowledge modelling, knowledge sharing and information management. In contrast to most of the existing steelmaking ontologies which merely focus on conceptual modelling, our work pays special attention to the real-world implementation and utilisation aspects of CROS.

Integrating external knowledge from Large Language Models (LLMs) offers a promising path toward enhancing healthcare prediction models. However, LLM responses for EHR data can exhibit high variability due to issues such as ambiguity and inconsistency, which hinder their practical application. To address these challenges, we propose IntelliCare, a novel framework that effectively leverages LLMs to generate high-quality, patient-level external knowledge and enhance existing EHR models. IntelliCare first identifies relevant patient cohorts and incorporates task-specific statistical information to improve LLM understanding and generation for clinical prediction tasks, thereby mitigating ambiguity. Furthermore, it refines LLM-derived knowledge through a hybrid strategy that calibrates multiple LLM responses using both EHR model embeddings and perplexity measures. Experimental evaluations across three clinical prediction tasks on two large-scale EHR datasets demonstrate that IntelliCare significantly improves performance over existing methods, underscoring its potential for advancing personalized healthcare predictions and decision support systems for physicians.

abstract = {Background
The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of making research data from all German hospitals available to scientists to respond to current and future pandemics promptly. The heterogeneous data originating from proprietary systems at hospitals' sites must be harmonized and accessible. The German Corona Consensus Dataset (GECCO) specifies how data for COVID-19 patients will be standardized in Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) profiles across German hospitals. However, given the complexity of the FHIR standard, the data harmonization is not sufficient to make the data accessible. A simplified visual representation is needed to reduce the technical burden, while allowing feasibility queries.
Objective
This study investigates how a search ontology can be automatically generated using FHIR profiles and a terminology server. Furthermore, it describes how this ontology can be used in a user interface (UI) and how a mapping and a terminology tree created together with the ontology can translate user input into FHIR queries.
Methods
We used the FHIR profiles from the GECCO data set combined with a terminology server to generate an ontology and the required mapping files for the translation. We analyzed the profiles and identified search criteria for the visual representation. In this process, we reduced the complex profiles to code value pairs for improved usability. We enriched our ontology with the necessary information to display it in a UI. We also developed an intermediate query language to transform the queries from the UI to federated FHIR requests. Separation of concerns resulted in discrepancies between the criteria used in the intermediate query format and the target query language. Therefore, a mapping was created to reintroduce all information relevant for creating the query in its target language. Further, we generated a tree representation of the ontology hierarchy, which allows resolving child concepts in the process.
Results
In the scope of this project, 82 (99%) of 83 elements defined in the GECCO profile were successfully implemented. We verified our solution based on an independently developed test patient. A discrepancy between the test data and the criteria was found in 6 cases due to different versions used to generate the test data and the UI profiles, the support for specific code systems, and the evaluation of postcoordinated Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine (SNOMED) codes. Our results highlight the need for governance mechanisms for version changes, concept mapping between values from different code systems encoding the same concept, and support for different unit dimensions.
Conclusions
We developed an automatic process to generate ontology and mapping files for FHIR-formatted data. Our tests found that this process works for most of our chosen FHIR profile criteria. The process established here works directly with FHIR profiles and a terminology server, making it extendable to other FHIR profiles and demonstrating that automatic ontology generation on FHIR profiles is feasible.}

abstract = {Background
Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are important for the quality and safety of health care delivery. Although CDSS rules guide CDSS behavior, they are not routinely shared and reused.
Objective
Ontologies have the potential to promote the reuse of CDSS rules. Therefore, we systematically screened the literature to elaborate on the current status of ontologies applied in CDSS rules, such as rule management, which uses captured CDSS rule usage data and user feedback data to tailor CDSS services to be more accurate, and maintenance, which updates CDSS rules. Through this systematic literature review, we aim to identify the frontiers of ontologies used in CDSS rules.
Methods
The literature search was focused on the intersection of ontologies; clinical decision support; and rules in PubMed, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library, and the Nursing & Allied Health Database. Grounded theory and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines were followed. One author initiated the screening and literature review, while 2 authors validated the processes and results independently. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were developed and refined iteratively.
Results
CDSSs were primarily used to manage chronic conditions, alerts for medication prescriptions, reminders for immunizations and preventive services, diagnoses, and treatment recommendations among 81 included publications. The CDSS rules were presented in Semantic Web Rule Language, Jess, or Jena formats. Despite the fact that ontologies have been used to provide medical knowledge, CDSS rules, and terminologies, they have not been used in CDSS rule management or to facilitate the reuse of CDSS rules.
Conclusions
Ontologies have been used to organize and represent medical knowledge, controlled vocabularies, and the content of CDSS rules. So far, there has been little reuse of CDSS rules. More work is needed to improve the reusability and interoperability of CDSS rules. This review identified and described the ontologies that, despite their limitations, enable Semantic Web technologies and their applications in CDSS rules.}

The hybrid models produce greatly reduced errors in their forecasts of the timing breakup events, with the best performance being a mean absolute error of 12.47 days for MWBs and 10.68 days for spring breakup. The results demonstrate the utility of the MWB Ontology as a tool for collating data and a means for analysis and forecasting of these events.}

However, little attention has been given to the standardization of the experimentations. Proper standardization can promote the reusability, replicability, and repeatability of VR experiments and accelerate the maturity of this emerging experimentation method. Responding to such needs, the authors proposed a virtual human-building interaction experimentation ontology (VHBIEO). It is an ontology at the domain level, extending the ontology of scientific experiments (EXPO) to standardize virtual human-building interaction experimentation. It was developed based on state-of-the-art ontology development approaches. Competency questions (CQs) were used to derive requirements and regulate the development. Semantic Web technologies were applied to make VHBIEO machine-readable, accessible, and processable. VHBIEO incorporates an application view (APV) to support the inclusion of unique information for particular applications. The authors performed taxonomy evaluations to assess the consistency, completeness, and redundancy, affirming no occurrence of errors in its structure. Application evaluations were applied for investigating its ability to standardize and support generating of machine-readable, accessible, and processable information.

Domain experts’ knowledge and the motivations for decision-making is a crucial asset for enterprises which is challenging to be captured and capitalised. Ontology-based Engineering (OBE) systems emerge as a new generation of Knowledge-based Engineering techniques with advancements of ontology engineering methods and computer science technologies. Ontologies enable to capture both explicit and implicit domain knowledge from historical records and domain experts. These Ontology-based Engineering systems can stand highly complex collaborative design processes involving multidisciplinary stakeholders and various digital tools. This paper proposes a tradespace framework with Ontology-based Engineering features included on top of existing Model-Based System Engineering and interoperability capabilities. These additional Ontology-based Engineering features reuse formalised knowledge via knowledge graph technologies and generative algorithms, changing the cognitive process from the designer, to an automatic process which generates design alternatives for the designer. The tradespace framework is demonstrated in a case study to design the aircraft fuselage orbital joint process, helping the designer to take better strategic decisions at conceptual phase and proving to be an advantageous paradigm for the design process.}

abstract = {Ontology matching plays a pivotal role in aligning entities across diverse ontologies, enhancing interoperability and data exchange. Similarity features are the foundation of ontology matching, which assess entity similarities from multiple perspectives. Selecting relevant similarity features tailored to specific matching tasks is crucial due to the intricate heterogeneity of entities. However, traditional similarity feature selection methods face significant limitations, such as reliance on extensively curated datasets, the need for extensive human intervention, and inconsistencies in handling complex high-dimensional data structures. To address these challenges, we develop a novel transfer learning approach for automatic similarity feature selection. Our approach includes a new transfer learning framework to enhance similarity feature selection for ontology matching, a novel similarity feature alignment extraction method utilizing mutual information to align feature subsets using an entropy-based metric, and a real-value compact genetic algorithm to adjust the feature space and train an ordered weighting aggregation-based classifier. We compared our method with advanced techniques on OAEI’s Benchmark and Bio-ML datasets. Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms the competitors across various tasks. By automating similarity feature selection and reducing dependency on manual interventions, our method addresses the complexities of traditional approaches, enhancing the practical utility of ontology matching.}

The DARPA depicted an explainable system, where an explainable model interacts with an explanation interface to generate explanations adapted to a user. We propose an explainable image classification system that follows this combination of explainable model and explanation interface as described by the DARPA. It takes advantage of the explainability of ontologies as well as the performance of machine learning models. This system is able to predict the class and properties of an object in an image. The results of this classification system are displayed in an explanation interface to help users understand and analyze the predictions of the proposed system. Our system exploits an ontology to build models that classify an object and its properties. The class and properties predicted by these models are instantiated in the ontology and added as assertions to an individual in order to verify the consistency of these predictions. Therefore, the system is able to warn the user when a prediction is uncertain and explain why, by using the ontology. These capacities will help users trust this system and better understand the predictions.}

In this paper, I take on this “argument from ontological choice,” claiming that it equivocates on the notion of choice. An ontological choice can be understood either in terms of determining which taxonomic scheme is valid, or in terms of deciding which taxonomic scheme to deploy in a given context. I try to show that while the latter can be determined in part by social values, the former ought not to be so determined.}

abstract = {Operation and maintenance (O&M) of underground utilities is crucial to ensure normal functionality of utilities by performing different inspection and maintenance activities. A variety of data are required by maintenance staff to evaluate utility condition and make decisions in planning maintenance works. Nevertheless, data required for utility O&M are usually originated from different sources, with various formats or representations. Interpreting and integrating such heterogenous data for utility O&M remains a significant challenge. Therefore, this paper proposes an ontology-based framework for modelling lifecycle utility information such as to facilitate activities and support decision making during utility O&M. The framework consists of (1) a data layer to collect various types of utility lifecycle data, (2) a knowledge layer to extract common mechanisms and methods for utility O&M, (3) an ontology layer where a domain ontology, Utility Operation and Maintenance Ontology (UOMO), is developed with entities and semantic rules to represent different categories of information related to utility projects, (4) an application layer to automate manual tasks and support decision making by leveraging the query and reasoning capability of ontology. To validate the framework, a case study is performed using real-world inspection data where a user interface is developed to allow users to implement different functions without technical knowledge. The case study demonstrates that the framework can, efficiently and automatically, extract and integrate various information to assist different activities, e.g. defect rating, condition assessment and validation, as well as to support decision making in prioritizing maintenance works, and selecting appropriate maintenance methods. This study contributes by proposing the first ontology-based framework for improving efficiency in utility O&M, where the query and semantic reasoning capabilities of the ontology are fully utilized. The developed ontology with lifecycle utility information is expected to facilitate data interoperability in the utility domain and can be extended with other knowledge for large-scale infrastructure management.}

This challenge requires the use of a wide variety of manufacturing technologies, which leads to a high level of planning effort and a cross-technology understanding of the manufacturing process. The decision of manufacturing technology application is generally based on the many years of experiential knowledge of the individual employees. As a result of demographic change, it is expected that there will be a reduction in the number of experienced employees in the European toolmaking industry. In addition, the recruitment of qualified employees is challenging and uncertain, making it difficult to ensure the transfer of knowledge. Therefore, the necessary process knowledge is at risk to be no longer available. As a result, competitiveness and the realization of future improvement projects in mechanical manufacturing can be impaired. The challenge is to secure experiential knowledge in a machine-readable form that preserves the knowledge that can be used for decision-making processes. This requires the classification of workpieces and manufacturing characteristics to access existing machining processes and transfer insights to other processes. An ontology is considered as an effective approach to organize, share and reuse knowledge. Ontologies are capable of classifying domain knowledge and visualizing it in machine-readable form. This paper presents an approach to developing an ontology-based decision support system for toolmaking and one-off production that supports the selection of manufacturing technologies and preserves accumulated experiential knowledge. This paper is presenting the development of an ontology of mechanical manufacturing with an agile methodology for the development of domain-specific ontologies. Furthermore, the ontology is integrated into an application software. The structure of the ontology can be used to secure the growing experiential knowledge of toolmaking. The validation is conducted using a case study from the mechanical manufacturing of toolmaking.}

The illustrated findings show how the PMDco bridges semantic gaps between high-level, MSE-specific, and other science domain semantics. Additionally, it demonstrates how the PMDco lowers development and integration thresholds. Moreover, the research highlights how to fuel it with real-world data sources ranging from manually conducted experiments and simulations with continuously automated industrial applications.}

abstract = {Cloud of Things (CoT) emerges as a pivotal paradigm, connecting Internet of Things (IoT) devices to the Cloud Computing space, facilitating the efficient management of smart cities. In navigating the intricate landscape of smart city environments, this paper confronts two paramount challenges— heterogeneity and privacy preservation. Heterogeneity, rooted in the diverse origins of CoT devices from various vendors, intro- duces compatibility gaps and data format variations, impeding seamless communication among devices. Simultaneously, privacy preservation concerns itself with averting the inadvertent disclo- sure of sensitive data generated by CoT devices. Existing solutions often exhibit limitations in effectively addressing both challenges concurrently. To bridge this gap, our proposed solution employs a novel ontology-based approach, commencing with the introduc- tion of a groundbreaking ”Ontology” using the Protege software. This foundational tool serves a dual purpose—standardizing and unifying general and privacy-related information among diverse CoT devices. The ontology addresses the heterogeneity challenge by fostering a shared understanding and vocabulary, promoting interoperability for smoother communication among disparate devices. Complementing the ontology, a privacy-preservation method, implemented with ”MININET-WIFI” and grounded in Modular Arithmetic, dynamically adjusts the privacy-preserving rules of each CoT device. This adaptive mechanism signifi- cantly enhances security, mitigating the risk of unintentional data disclosure—a critical aspect evaluated extensively within the context of a widely used CoT application, specifically, the Autonomous Vehicle (AV) environment. The computational cost is meticulously evaluated, showcasing that our solution introduces a modest overhead, notably below 1.8 s, compared to alternative models. Furthermore, the penetration rate analysis reveals the solution's resilience against honest but curious Remote Service Units (RSUs). Communication overhead is quantified for various privacy-preserving methods, providing a comprehensive view of the solution's performance. Through rigorous simula- tions, encompassing assessments of communication overhead, computational costs, and penetration rates, our solution exhibits not only affordability for a diverse array of CoT devices in smart cities but also heightened resilience against malicious activities and adversaries, surpassing current studies. This paper, therefore, not only presents a novel ontology-based solution but also delves into the nuanced intricacies of heterogeneity and privacy preservation within CoT-based smart cities. The proposed approach, characterized by its dual focus on standardization and dynamic privacy adaptation, signifies a significant stride towards fostering secure, interoperable, and privacy-aware CoT ecosystems amid the dynamic landscape of smart cities.}

The research is segmented through systematic evaluation into ten application domains within the construction realm- process, cost, operation/maintenance, health/safety, sustainability, monitoring/control, intelligent cities, heritage building information modelling (HBIM), compliance, and miscellaneous. This categorisation aids in pinpointing ontologies suitable for various research objectives. Furthermore, the paper highlights prevalent limitations within current ontology studies in the AEC sector.

Moreover, the value of the prognostic information provided by a prognostic method, when applied to a given machine, depends on the system structure and the production and maintenance planning process. Therefore, it is necessary to consider the impact of such information on the system’s key performance indicators to assess the real benefits of each prognostic method. Based on knowledge from predictive maintenance approaches, manufacturing system simulation, and production and maintenance planning, an appropriate semantic model allows establishing a shared vocabulary and understanding among all these fields, along with a description of their relationship. Thus, this paper proposes an ontology of domain termed Ontological MetaMaintain (OntoMM), which specifies the description of concepts and their relationships to provide evolutionary knowledge on domain structure which further specializes in information flows.

However, once it relies on ontologies, proper representation of Link and Connection – entities that bind the communication nodes – is paramount. Unfortunately, although several network-related ontologies present these concepts, they are unclear on which entities they bind, nor do they present them simultaneously. Also, the same ambiguity can be perceived in vocabulary recommendations of several telecommunication standard bodies. Our main contribution is the ontological analysis that clarifies the definition of Link and Connection in telecommunication domain.

abstract = {Background
Web-based resources and social media platforms play an increasingly important role in health-related knowledge and experience sharing. There is a growing interest in the use of these novel data sources for epidemiological surveillance of substance use behaviors and trends.
Objective
The key aims were to describe the development and application of the drug abuse ontology (DAO) as a framework for analyzing web-based and social media data to inform public health and substance use research in the following areas: determining user knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to nonmedical use of buprenorphine and illicitly manufactured opioids through the analysis of web forum data Prescription Drug Abuse Online Surveillance; analyzing patterns and trends of cannabis product use in the context of evolving cannabis legalization policies in the United States through analysis of Twitter and web forum data (eDrugTrends); assessing trends in the availability of novel synthetic opioids through the analysis of cryptomarket data (eDarkTrends); and analyzing COVID-19 pandemic trends in social media data related to 13 states in the United States as per Mental Health America reports.
Methods
The domain and scope of the DAO were defined using competency questions from popular ontology methodology (101 ontology development). The 101 method includes determining the domain and scope of ontology, reusing existing knowledge, enumerating important terms in ontology, defining the classes, their properties and creating instances of the classes. The quality of the ontology was evaluated using a set of tools and best practices recognized by the semantic web community and the artificial intelligence community that engage in natural language processing.
Results
The current version of the DAO comprises 315 classes, 31 relationships, and 814 instances among the classes. The ontology is flexible and can easily accommodate new concepts. The integration of the ontology with machine learning algorithms dramatically decreased the false alarm rate by adding external knowledge to the machine learning process. The ontology is recurrently updated to capture evolving concepts in different contexts and applied to analyze data related to social media and dark web marketplaces.
Conclusions
The DAO provides a powerful framework and a useful resource that can be expanded and adapted to a wide range of substance use and mental health domains to help advance big data analytics of web-based data for substance use epidemiology research.}

abstract = {This study aims to investigate the mediating role of ontological well-being in the relationship between resilience, psychological well-being, and depression in refugee women. It is known that most refugee women experience different types of stress factors. It is assumed that refugees will feel depressed when they encounter negative situations and their psychological well-being will decrease. However, when the resilience levels of refugees are high, it is expected that their ontological welfare will increase and they will see their whole life as a project that includes past, present, and future time components. The sample of the study consisted of 288 refugee women. Demographic Information Form, Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale, Major Depression Inventory, Ontological Well-Beilng Scale, and WHO-5 Well-Being Scale were used as assessment tools. The data were tested using structural equation modeling. This study showed that the relationship between psychological resilience and well-being was fully mediated by the effect of ontological well-being on refugee women. It was also found that ontological well-being had a partial mediation effect on the relationship between resilience and depression.}

abstract = {Maintenance and Industrial Asset Management (AM) are fundamental business processes in guaranteeing the availability of physical assets at minimum risk and cost, while balancing the interests of several stakeholders. To reach operational excellence, intra- and inter-enterprise interoperability of systems is needed to support information management and integration between several involved parties. To this end, ontology engineering is relevant since it supports interoperability at technical and semantic levels. However, ontology modelling methodologies are varied, and several best practices exist, amongst which knowledge reuse. Nevertheless, reusing extant knowledge is not completely exploited so far, causing a heterogeneous ensemble of ontologies that are not orchestrated. The present work aims at promoting the adoption of knowledge reuse for ontology modelling in maintenance and AM. Therefore, an extensive review of existing ontologies for the two targeted business processes is performed with a twofold objective: firstly, to realise a cross-industrial ontological compendium, and secondly to understand the state of art of ontology modelling in maintenance and AM. To support the adoption of knowledge reuse, this practice is framed in AMODO (Asset Management Ontology Development methOdology). Finally, a laboratory-sized showcase is provided to prove the usefulness of relying on knowledge reuse during the ontology development. The results show that the developed ontology is realised faster and is inherently aligned with established ontologies, towards enterprise systems interoperability. Consequently, maintenance and AM business processes may rely on information management and integration to pursue operational excellence.}

abstract = {Video games have assumed an important place in our daily lives. This has led to an increasing interest on the use of games for non-entertainment purposes, introducing the concept of Serious Games (SGs). In particular, SGs are being explored because of their potential to provide reliable assessments, but also because they can measure competences that would be difficult to measure using traditional forms of assessment. However, one of the key issues is that assessment machinery has to be designed specifically for each game, increasing the time and effort when designing and implementing Game-Based Assessments (GBAs). In this research, we introduce a novel approach to develop interoperable GBAs by: (1) designing and creating an ontology that can standardize the GBA area; (2) conducting a validation study on literature metrics to replicate them and designing novel metrics using data from different SGs; (3) conducting a case study that illustrates how our approach can be used in a real life scenario with real data. Our results confirm that the designed ontology can be used to effectively perform GBAs, along with the metrics replicated and designed in the system. We expect our work to solve the current limitations regarding GBA interoperability, thus allowing the deployment of Game-Based Assessments as a Service (GBAaaS).}

abstract = {Ontology meta-matching techniques have been consolidated as one of the best approaches to face the problem of discovering semantic relationships between knowledge models that belong to the same domain but have been developed independently. After more than a decade of research, the community has reached a stage of maturity characterized by increasingly better results and aspects such as the robustness and scalability of solutions have been solved. However, the resulting models remain practically intelligible to a human operator. In this work, we present a novel approach based on Mamdani fuzzy inference exploiting a model very close to natural language. This fact has a double objective: to achieve results with high degrees of accuracy but at the same time to guarantee the interpretability of the resulting models. After validating our proposal with several ontological models popular in the biomedical field, we can conclude that the results obtained are promising.}
