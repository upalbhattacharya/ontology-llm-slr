"Integrating Ontology Rules with Large Language Models for Enhanced Reasoning","I. Paik","School of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Aizu","2025 International Technical Conference on Circuits/Systems, Computers, and Communications (ITC-CSCC)","2 Sep 2025","2025","","","1","8","Ontology-based reasoning enables structured inference and logical consistency in specialized domains. However, traditional ontology reasoning frameworks rely heavily on predefined inference engines and XML-based structured data, limiting their integration with Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite their strong general reasoning capabilities, LLMs struggle with structured ontological knowledge due to their reliance on unstructured text.This study proposes a novel approach to integrating ontology-based reasoning into LLMs by transforming ontological concepts and rules into structured natural language. By systematically defining ontology components—such as classes, properties, and rules—using a natural language-friendly format, we enable LLMs to process and infer knowledge from domain-specific ontologies without dedicated inference engines. The feasibility of this transformation is demonstrated through experiments on a domain-specific cocktail ontology. Our findings highlight the potential of natural language-driven ontology representation in bridging the gap between rule-based inference and flexible LLM reasoning.","2997-741X","979-8-3315-5363-0","10.1109/ITC-CSCC66376.2025.11137761","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11137761","Ontology;Large Language Model;Ontology Reasoning;Ontology in Natural Language;RAG","Computers;Limiting;Large language models;Scalability;Natural languages;Computer architecture;Ontologies;Cognition;Engines;Optimization","","","","14","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

OntoKGen leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) through an interactive user interface guided by our adaptive iterative Chain of Thought (CoT) algorithm to ensure that the ontology extraction process and, thus, KG generation align with user-specific requirements. Although KG generation follows a clear, structured path based on the confirmed ontology, there is no universally correct ontology as it is inherently based on the user's preferences. OntoKGen recommends an ontology grounded in best practices, minimizing user effort and providing valuable insights that may have been overlooked, all while giving the user complete control over the final ontology. Having generated the KG based on the confirmed ontology, OntoKGen enables seamless integration into schemeless, non-relational databases like Neo4j. This integration allows for flexible storage and retrieval of knowledge from diverse, unstructured sources, facilitating advanced querying, analysis, and decision-making. Moreover, the generated KG serves as a robust foundation for future integration into Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, offering enhanced capabilities for developing domain-specific intelligent applications.","2577-0993","979-8-3503-6774-4","10.1109/RAMS48127.2025.10935139","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10935139","Large Language Model;Ontology and Knowledge Graph Generator;Prompt Engineering;Neo4J","Large language models;Retrieval augmented generation;Pipelines;Random access memory;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;User interfaces;Reliability engineering;Generators;Prompt engineering","","","","7","IEEE","27 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our approach requires only a natural language description of a capability, which is then automatically inserted into a predefined prompt using a few-shot prompting technique. After prompting an LLM, the resulting capability ontology is automatically verified through various steps in a loop with the LLM to check the overall correctness of the capability ontology. First, a syntax check is performed, then a check for contradictions, and finally a check for hallucinations and missing ontology elements.

However, the current fault diagnosis methods primarily rely on data-driven approaches, which often result in a high threshold for application due to their lack of interpretability. To tackle this challenge, this paper introduces a novel approach based on large language models for knowledge mining from textual data to extract fault information related to the fire water system, thereby enhancing the interpretability of data-driven fault diagnosis methods. The methodology followed in this paper consists of two main steps: firstly, analyzing the characteristics and principles of fire water system faults to develop a fault ontology, and secondly, creating a knowledge mining model using a large language model guided by the established fault ontology. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed model achieves an F1 score of 0.944, meeting the necessary criteria for effective knowledge mining in fire water system fault analysis. Furthermore, a comparative experiment was conducted to evaluate the performance of various encoder models, including GRU, BiGRU, LSTM, BiLSTM, and pre-trained large language model BERT. The results revealed a significant improvement in performance with the BERT encoder, showing increases in F1 scores of $22.12 \%$, $2.27 \%, 17.41 \%$, and $3.16 \%$ compared to the other models, respectively.

This paper introduces a hybrid approach for extracting information on computational methods that combines domain-specific dictionaries with LLMs in order to improve the accuracy of method categorization. Our system incorporates explainability, allowing users to understand the reasoning behind method assignments. Furthermore, user-driven training is facilitated by allowing users to select theories and highlight relevant keywords, enhancing learning capabilities of the system.

However, due to limitations in understanding specialized literature in vertical fields, large language models face serious issues of “hallucination” and prior bias when responding to teachers' questions about specialized domains. To address this, this paper proposes an intelligent construction framework for ontology models based on knowledge tuple extraction, called OntoCons, which introduces entity extraction and relation extraction methods into the field of ontology model construction. OntoCons transforms the ontology model construction problem into a knowledge tuple extraction problem, enhancing the transparency and interpretability of ontology model construction methods, and introduces subgraph encoding strategies to improve the accuracy of relation extraction. This research provides a new method for the intelligent construction of ontology models in vertical fields, improving the understanding and response quality of large language models in specialized domains by combining machine learning and manual analysis.","","979-8-3315-0796-1","10.1109/NNICE64954.2025.11063905","Wuhan Business University(grant numbers:2023N013); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11063905","large language model;ontology model;knowledge extraction;entity extraction;relation extraction","Knowledge engineering;Accuracy;Large language models;Manuals;Machine learning;Transforms;Ontologies;Reliability theory;Encoding;Data mining","","","","12","IEEE","15 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using counts of ontology IDs in the PubMed Central (PMC) dataset as a surrogate for their prevalence in the biomedical literature, we examined the relationship between ontology ID prevalence and mapping accuracy. Results indicate that ontology ID prevalence strongly predicts accurate mapping of HPO terms to HPO IDs, GO terms to GO IDs, and protein names to UniProtKB accession numbers. Higher prevalence of ontology IDs in the biomedical literature correlated with higher mapping accuracy. Predictive models based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves confirmed this relationship. In contrast, this pattern did not apply to mapping protein names to Human Genome Organisation's (HUGO) gene symbols. GPT-4 achieved a high baseline performance (95 %) in mapping protein names to HUGO gene symbols, with mapping accuracy unaffected by prevalence. We propose that the high prevalence of HUGO gene symbols in the literature has caused these symbols to become lexicalized, enabling GPT-4 to map protein names to HUGO gene symbols with high accuracy. These findings highlight the limitations of LLMs in mapping ontology terms to low-prevalence ontology IDs and underscore the importance of incorporating ontology ID prevalence into the training and evaluation of LLMs for biomedical applications.","","979-8-3315-2400-5","10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00101","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11050705","Ontology mapping;machine codes;large language models;Zipf's Law;Gene Ontology;Human Phenotype Ontology;lexicalization;UniProt KB","Proteins;Training;Protein engineering;Accuracy;Phenotypes;Terminology;Large language models;Symbols;Training data;Ontologies","","","","38","IEEE","7 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While disease ontologies are useful for annotation, integration, and analysis of biological data, codified disease and procedure categories e.g. SNOMED-CT, ICD10, CPT, etc. rarely capture all of the nuances in a patient condition or, in the case of rare disease, may not even exist. Furthermore, there are multiple disease definitions used in data sources and publications, each having its own structure and hierarchy. Mapping between ontologies, finding disease clusters, and building a representation of the chosen disease area are resource-intensive, often requiring significant human capital. We propose the creation and curation of a patient knowledge graph utilizing large language model extraction techniques. In order to expand in volume and scale, knowledge graphs with generalized language capability allow for data to be extracted using natural language rather than being constrained by the exact terminology or hierarchy of existing ontologies. We develop a method of mapping back to existing ontologies such as MeSH, SNOMED-CT, RxNORM, HPO, etc. to ground the extracted entities to known entities in the medical community.We have access to one of the largest ambulatory care EHR databases in the country. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we benchmark our extraction in a test set with over 33.6M unique patients, in the area of patient search.

To address this, this paper proposes an ontology embedding framework based on graph language models, named GLMSubs, aimed at enhancing the prediction of subclass relationships. The GLMSubs framework adopts a two-stage strategy of “multi-semantic view partitioning” and “advanced training of graph language models”. Initially, it deconstructs the ontology's concepts, attributes, and instance information into five types of semantic views, such as class hierarchy view and class-attribute relationship view, through a multi-view partitioning mechanism, comprehensively capturing information from different semantic dimensions. Subsequently, the framework employs graph language models for joint training on the multi-view data to obtain embeddings that integrate both semantic and structural information. Experiments on datasets such as FoodOn and GO validate the effectiveness of GLMSubs, demonstrating that its performance in class hierarchy relationship prediction tasks significantly surpasses existing methods.","","979-8-3315-2882-9","10.1109/DSInS64146.2024.10992171","Natural Science Foundation of Chongqing(grant numbers:CSTB2023NSCQ-MSX0145); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10992171","knowledge representation learning;graph language models;OWL ontology;knowledge graph","Training;Proteins;Biological system modeling;Semantics;OWL;Knowledge graphs;Medical services;Ontologies;Predictive models;Resource description framework","","","","11","IEEE","20 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Our framework addresses this issue by leveraging existing, large knowledge bases for medicine to generate vast query and answer sets dynamically, which are less likely to be memorized by LLMs. The framework rests on designing a few key knowledge patterns, which can then generate millions (potentially billions) of queries.

The probability of a document generating the topics is estimated by the similarity between the document and each cluster. Then, the probability of the topics generating words is estimated using Expectation Maximization algorithm. At last, we integrate the above algorithms into aspect model to form our topic language model.

They are typically subject to a set of structural constraints restricting their content. However, manual taxonomy construction can be time-consuming, incomplete, and costly to maintain. Recent studies of large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated that appropriate user inputs (called prompting) can effectively guide LLMs, such as GPT-3, in diverse NLP tasks without explicit (re-)training. However, existing approaches for automated taxonomy construction typically involve fine-tuning a language model by adjusting model parameters. In this paper, we present a general framework for taxonomy construction that takes into account structural constraints. We subsequently conduct a systematic comparison between the prompting and fine-tuning approaches performed on a hypernym taxonomy and a novel computer science taxonomy dataset. Our result reveals the following: (1) Even without explicit training on the dataset, the prompting approach outperforms fine-tuning-based approaches. Moreover, the performance gap between prompting and fine-tuning widens when the training dataset is small. However, (2) taxonomies generated by the fine-tuning approach can be easily post-processed to satisfy all the constraints, whereas handling violations of the taxonomies produced by the prompting approach can be challenging.

Knowledge engineering, like compiling companies’ vast bodies of knowledge into these structures, however, still represents a time-consuming, largely manually performed process, esp. with significant amounts of knowledge often only recorded within unstructured text documents. Since the recently introduced Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on text summarization, this raises the question whether these could be exploited within dedicated knowledge fusion architectures to assist human knowledge engineers by automatically suggesting relevant classes, instances and relations extracted from textual corpora. We therefore propose a novel approach that leverages the taxonomic structure of a partially defined ontology to prompt LLMs for hierarchical knowledge organization. Unlike conventional methods that rely solely on static ontologies, our methodology dynamically generates prompts based on the ontology’s existing class taxonomy, prompting the LLM to generate responses that extract supplementary information from unstructured documents. It thus introduces the concept of using ontologies as scaffolds for guiding LLMs, in order to realize a mutual interplay between structured ontological knowledge and the soft fusion capabilities of LLMs. We evaluate our proposed algorithm on a real-world case study, performing a knowledge fusion task on heterogeneous technical documentation from a medical prosthesis manufacturer.","","978-1-7377497-6-9","10.23919/FUSION59988.2024.10706469","Austrian Science Fund; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10706469","Large Language Models;Knowledge Engineering;Ontology Population;Soft Fusion;Natural Language Processing","Knowledge engineering;Large language models;Taxonomy;Text summarization;Organizations;Manuals;Documentation;Ontologies;Manufacturing;Prosthetics","","3","","18","","11 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Existing compressor fault diagnosis methods mostly relies on data-driven, which leads to a high application threshold from the mechanism. To address this issue, this paper introduces the knowledge graph into the compressor fault diagnosis for the first time and proposes a compressor fault text data knowledge mining method based on large language model. Firstly, the characteristics and principles of compressor faults are analyzed. Then, a text data knowledge mining model called CFRTE for compressors is constructed. Experimental results show that the Fl score of the CFRTE model can reach 0.98, meeting the requirements of compressor fault knowledge mining. Finally, combined with the results of knowledge mining and the graph database, a new system for the storage and indexing of the compressor fault knowledge graph is proposed. To further verify the role of the large language model in compressor fault knowledge mining, this paper conducts a comparative experiment of CFRTE models based on RNN encoder and BERT encoder. Experimental results show that compared with GRU, BiGRU, LSTM, and BiLSTM as the encoder layer, the Fl score of the CFRTE model with BERT as the encoder layer has increased by 26.78%, 6.18%, 21.89%, and 5.49% respectively.

The contribution of large language models is that it adds semantic understanding capability to the predictive power provided through neural networks. Domain ontologies will be used in this hybrid model to enhance the accuracy and personalization of recommendations, considering complex user preferences and product attributes in e-commerce platforms. It takes a state-of-the-art pre-trained LLM, such as Llama-3, as input and generates personalized embeddings of users based on history, item descriptions, and contextual information. In this work, the Transformer architecture has been used in re-fining and ranking the products for relevance using attention mechanisms that select the most important features in each recommendation task. Besides, knowledge distillation will be used to conduct the small and efficient student model training process. The distilled model receives soft predictions that involve the teacher LLM, which greatly reduces computational overhead but preserves high recommendation accuracy.

As textual clinical reports are the richest source of phenotypes information, their automatic extraction is a critical task. The main challenges of this Information Extraction (IE) task are to identify precisely the text spans related to a phenotype and to link them unequivocally to referenced entities from a source such as the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). Recently, Language Models (LMs) have been the most suc-cessful approach for extracting phenotypes from clinical reports. Solutions such as PhenoBERT, relying on BERT or GPT, have shown promising results when applied to datasets built on the hypothesis that most phenotypes are explicitly mentioned in the text. However, this assumption is not always true in medical genetics. Hence, although the LMs carry powerful semantic abilities, their contributions are not clear compared to syntactic string-matching steps that are used within the current pipelines. The goal of this study is to improve phenotype extraction from clinical notes related to genetic diseases. Our contributions are threefold: First, we provide a clear definition of the phenotype extraction task from free text, along with a high-level overview of the involved functions. Second, we conduct an in-depth analysis of PhenoBERT, one of the best existing solutions, to evaluate the proportion of phenotypes predicted with simple string-matching. Third, we demonstrate how utilizing and incorporating large language models (LLMs) for span detection step can improve performance especially with implicit phenotypes.

However, some of the existing embedding-based methods for knowledge base question answering systems ignore the subtle correlation between the question and the Knowledge Base (e.g., entity types, relation paths, and context) and suffer from the Out Of Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we focused on using a pre-trained language model for the Knowledge Base Question Answering task. Firstly, we used Bert base uncased for the initial experiments. We further fine-tuned these embeddings with a two way attention mechanism from the knowledge base to the asked question and from the asked question to the knowledge base answer aspects. Our method is based on a simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture with a Multi-Head Attention mechanism to represent the asked question dynamically in multiple aspects. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the Bert pre-trained language model embeddings for question answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known embedding methods.","2161-4407","978-1-7281-6926-2","10.1109/IJCNN48605.2020.9206698","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9206698","knowledge base question answering;BERT;Language Model;KBQA;Multi-Head Attention","Knowledge based systems;Task analysis;Bit error rate;Knowledge discovery;Semantics;Natural languages;Context modeling","","10","","52","IEEE","28 Sep 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

RNA sequencing has become an essential method in the life sciences, providing a comprehensive means to quantitatively evaluate RNA levels in tissues and cells. From alignment to subsequent pathway analysis, the increasing usage of RNA-seq has inspired continuous creation of creative tools for all phases of study. For non-experts especially, it is difficult to use these analytical approaches in a scalable, repeatable, and easily available manner. We have established an intuitive, rapid, efficient, and thorough process for RNA-seq analysis using the workflow management system “Nextflow.” LYNX-RNA (Language-augmented Yield for Nextflow-based RNA eXpression analysis) enhances RNA-seq analysis involves the processing of raw sequencing data through alignment, quality control, and subsequent differential expression and pathway analysis. LYNX-RNA incorporates a distinctive integration with a Large Language Model (LLM) that autonomously produces concise, comprehensible summaries of results, thereby rendering RNA-seq data analysis accessible to a diverse audience, including clinicians, biomedical researchers, pharmaceutical scientists, public health professionals, educators, and students. This enhanced accessibility enables other sectors to extract relevant insights from RNA-seq data without necessitating substantial bioinformatics knowledge. The pipeline was verified with patient-derived xenografts from leukemia and lymphoma, identifying differentially expressed genes and enriched pathways pertinent to disease development and therapy response. LYNX-RNA's applications encompass oncology, virology, immunology, personalized medicine, neuroscience, and agriculture, facilitating biomarker discovery, therapeutic target identification, and sustainable agricultural innovations, thereby rendering RNA-seq analysis both accessible and significant across various fields. Looking forward, LYNX-RNA aims to incorporate multi-omics integration, single-cell and spatial transcriptomics support, and machine learning-based predictive analytics. Planned enhancements include cloud deployment, improved visualization, compatibility with long-read sequencing, and clinical application readiness.

Ontologies exist in a spectrum of formality, from lexical thesauri to knowledge graphs, to collections of statements of first-order logic. The recent proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has brought to bear interactive “knowledge bases” with general awareness of most things. As ontologists create ontologies from their understanding of reality; and as LLMs, presumably, possess some “understanding” of reality, embedded in their vector matrices corresponding to lexical terms from massive quantities of learned texts, a question is posed: what form of ontology can an LLM create when prompted about some novel facet of reality, without explicitly asking it for an ontology? I.e., will an LLM categorize things into bins, or a subsumption hierarchy, or perhaps something else? LLMs, as they are understood, respond when prompted with the most likely response, because they are predictors of next tokens, i.e., they are stochastic parrots. In any case, it is posited that, if prompted without any explicit request for an ontology, an LLM can produce an ontology of novel form, effectively granting insight into the “understanding” an LLM has of the world, as all humans possess an understanding of the world that ontologies are based upon. This paper explores the use of the flagship LLM, GPT-4, in forming an ontology of a novel domain.","","979-8-3503-5801-8","10.1109/TransAI60598.2023.00043","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387600","ontology;taxonomy;large language models;GPT","Visualization;Taxonomy;Natural languages;Supervised learning;OWL;Stochastic processes;Organizations","","1","","28","IEEE","16 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This research focuses on minimizing variability in the reporting of outcome measures through a comparative analysis of rule-based and advanced language modeling techniques. The rule-based method employs established ontologies, while the language model-based approach utilizes large language models. Findings indicate a low linkage of outcomes to traditional rule-based ontology, particularly for three-word outcomes, and underscore large language models’ efficacy in recognizing semantically similar outcomes across varying word counts. This supports the critical role of large language models in harmonizing outcome data, reducing redundancies, and improving data interoperability in clinical research contexts.","","979-8-3315-1984-1","10.1109/IEMCON62851.2024.11093511","University of Utah; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11093511","Clinical trial;Semantic variability;Large language model;GPT;SBERT;Outcome alignment","Analytical models;Terminology;Large language models;Semantics;Redundancy;Pipelines;Clinical trials;Ontologies;Mobile communication;Interoperability","","","","36","IEEE","30 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For this reason, this paper introduces Large-scale Language Model (LLM) and Knowledge Graph (KG) in the assembly sequence generation of micro-assembly robots, and puts forward the method of ""Thinking with Knowledge Graph"" (TwKG). By integrating external knowledge such as manual assembly experience, a priori information of parts, and robot information, the method enables the micro-assembly robot to generate assembly sequences autonomously, optimize the sequences based on assembly experience, and update the sequences autonomously in case of environmental changes. Since the sequences directly generated by this method cannot be directly used for device control, a Reactive Behavioral Trees method (RBT) based on dynamic behavioral trees is designed based on the analysis of rationality relationships among assembly sequences for automatically creating and updating assembly sequences to cope with abnormal situations. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving assembly efficiency and sequence rationality is verified by comprehensive tests in the equipment platform.","","979-8-3315-2452-4","10.1109/RAIIE65740.2025.11139975","China Academy of Engineering Physics; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11139975","assembly sequence planning;information fusion;knowledge graph;large language modeling;micro-target","Knowledge engineering;Training;Visualization;Large language models;Knowledge graphs;Manuals;Cognition;Planning;Assembly;Robots","","","","21","IEEE","2 Sep 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For example, novices have trouble learning how to use the language, and besides these inconsistencies prevent i* from being largely adopted in business settings. Based on positive results from previous work related to conceptual modeling languages, we believe that foundational ontologies may present a promising solution for this problem. Foundational ontologies may help clarifying the semantics of core i* constructs and provide practical guidelines for their use. Last, they may serve as the basis to propose a normative definition of the framework.

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel context-sensitive semantic smoothing method that decomposes a document into a set of weighted context-sensitive topic signatures and then maps those topic signatures into query terms. The language model with such a context- sensitive semantic smoothing is referred to as the topic signature language model. In detail, we implement two types of topic signatures, depending on whether ontology exists in the application domain. One is the ontology-based concept and the other is the multiword phrase. The mapping probabilities from each topic signature to individual terms are estimated through the EM algorithm. Document models based on topic signature mapping are then derived. The new smoothing method is evaluated on the TREC 2004/ 2005 Genomics Track with ontology-based concepts, as well as the TREC Ad Hoc Track (Disks 1, 2, and 3) with multiword phrases.

Automatically annotating protein functions by using GO-based computational models has been an area of active research for a long time. However, due to the limited functional annotation information and complex topological structures of GO, existing models cannot effectively capture the knowledge representation of GO. To solve this issue, we present a method that fuses the functional and topological knowledge of GO to guide protein function prediction. This method employs a multi-view GCN model to extract a variety of GO representations from functional information, topological structure, and their combinations. To dynamically learn the significance weights of these representations, it adopts an attention mechanism to learn the final knowledge representation of GO. Furthermore, it uses a pre-trained language model (i.e., ESM-1b) to efficiently learn biological features for each protein sequence. Finally, it obtains all predicted scores by calculating the dot product of sequence features and GO representation.

An approach to automating DSL creation and facilitating code generation based on using multifaceted ontology is proposed. The generalized description of the multifaceted ontology is given. Tools of automating generation of new DSL metamodels based on mapping the corresponding domain ontology onto the metamodels of the selected base languages are described. Metamodels of the visual languages, grammars of the target text languages and transformation rules are also included into the ontology. The proposed approach is implemented as a research prototype of the language toolkits. Examples of metamodels and rules described in the ontology, as well as the results of their application are shown. The results of experiments confirmed practical significance of the approach to the ontology-driven language toolkits development.","2472-8586","979-8-3503-0356-8","10.1109/AICT59525.2023.10313152","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10313152","domain-specific modeling;domain-specific languages;metamodeling;multifaceted ontology;metamodel generation;model transformation rules","Visualization;Codes;Prototypes;Metamodeling;Ontologies;Grammar;DSL","","1","","17","IEEE","13 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Finally, developers can amend ontology according to the feedback information. This process is repeated until the inconsistency of ontology is eliminated. Consequently, the above-mentioned methodology improves the accuracy and efficiency of domain ontology modeling.

However, security measures, often implemented late in the engineering process, lead to costly and complicated implementations. Thus, this article is concerned with the “security by design” principle in ICSs and facilitates compliance with ICS security standards, which can be legally mandated for some critical systems or adopted by asset owners to protect their assets. Current methods for compliance demand manual efforts from security experts, making the compliance process time-consuming and costly. To address this, we propose a framework for leveraging large language models (LLMs) combined with knowledge graphs to automate the interpretation of security requirements and system architecture as two main elements of the design phase. Our knowledge graph-augmented LLM framework converts system architectures into human natural language, enhancing the automation of various security analyses, especially those that need to handle textual requirements. The framework enables validating applicable security requirements provided by IEC 62443-3-3 (a widely-used ICS security standard) concerning system designs through a question-and-answer interface. To evaluate the framework, various questions with reference responses from human experts were prepared in the context of a use case, and the quality of the LLMs' responses was measured across various metrics. Moreover, we compared the framework with a baseline approach based on formal queries.

However, current CTI knowledge extraction methods lack flexibility and generalizability, often resulting in inaccurate and incomplete knowledge extraction. Syntax parsing relies on fixed rules and dictionaries, while model fine-tuning requires large annotated datasets, making both paradigms challenging to adapt to new threats and ontologies. To bridge the gap, we propose CTINexus, a novel framework leveraging optimized in-context learning (ICL) of large language models (LLMs) for data-efficient CTI knowledge extraction and high-quality cybersecurity knowledge graph (CSKG) construction. Unlike existing methods, CTINexus requires neither extensive data nor parameter tuning and can adapt to various ontologies with minimal annotated examples. This is achieved through: (1) a carefully designed automatic prompt construction strategy with optimal demonstration retrieval for extracting a wide range of cybersecurity entities and relations; (2) a hierarchical entity alignment technique that canonicalizes the extracted knowledge and removes redundancy; (3) an long-distance relation prediction technique to further complete the CSKG with missing links. Our extensive evaluations using 150 real-world CTI reports collected from 10 platforms demonstrate that CTINexus significantly outperforms existing methods in constructing accurate and complete CSKG, highlighting its potential to transform CTI analysis with an efficient and adaptable solution for the dynamic threat landscape.","2995-1356","979-8-3315-9493-0","10.1109/EuroSP63326.2025.00057","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11129447","Cyber Threat Intelligence;Large Language Model;In-Context Learning;Cybersecurity Knowledge Graph","Large language models;Redundancy;Knowledge graphs;Transforms;Organizations;Ontologies;Syntactics;Cyber threat intelligence;Computer security;Tuning","","","","90","IEEE","26 Aug 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the actual deployment of these systems is limited by the scarcity of labeled data that is required for training. Neuro-Symbolic AI (NeSy) provides an interesting research direction to mitigate this issue, by infusing common-sense knowledge about human activities and the contexts in which they can be performed into HAR deep learning classifiers. Existing NeSy methods for context-aware HAR rely on knowledge encoded in logic-based models (e.g., ontologies) whose design, implementation, and maintenance to capture new activities and contexts require significant human engineering efforts, technical knowledge, and domain expertise. Recent works show that pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively encode common-sense knowledge about human activities. In this work, we propose ContextGPT: a novel prompt engineering approach to retrieve from LLMs common-sense knowledge about the relationship between human activities and the context in which they are performed. Unlike ontologies, ContextGPT requires limited human effort and expertise, while sharing similar privacy concerns if the reasoning is performed in the cloud. An extensive evaluation using two public datasets shows how a NeSy model obtained by infusing common-sense knowledge from ContextGPT is effective in data scarcity scenarios, leading to similar (and sometimes better) recognition rates than logic-based approaches with a fraction of the effort.","2693-8340","979-8-3503-4994-8","10.1109/SMARTCOMP61445.2024.00029","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10595652","human activity recognition;context-awareness;large language models","Knowledge engineering;Deep learning;Training;Privacy;Computational modeling;Ontologies;Human activity recognition","","5","","32","IEEE","24 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The effectiveness of a modeling language for the aforementioned tasks is strongly related to the languages domain appropriateness, i.e., To the language's ability to express the relevant characteristics of the domain at hand. A language designer must, therefore, understand the phenomena (or domain) that should be covered by the language and propose symbolic structures that will empower prospective language users to efficiently carry out certain tasks concerning the represented phenomena. This requires the design of a language with some form of correspondence between its constructs and things in the external world, which we call real-world semantics. Although essential to language design and semantic interoperability tasks, the real-world semantics of conceptual modeling languages for the enterprise is often defined only informally with no rigor or methodological support for the language designer. As a consequence, a number of language issues may arise, including lack of semantic clarity and expressiveness, which ultimately affect the language's ability to serve as a basis for communication, analysis and transformation. In this tutorial, we will discuss advances in the last decade concerning the application of reference ontologies to address these issues. We will show how well-founded reference ontologies can serve to inform the design and revision of enterprise modeling languages. In order to provide a solid basis for reference ontologies, we will discuss the role of a foundational ontology in this process (the Unified Foundational Ontology, UFO). A number of concrete cases of language revision will be discussed involving Archi Mate and other languages, encompassing different enterprise architectural domains (such as services, capabilities, goals, organizational structure, etc.).","2325-6605","978-1-4673-9331-7","10.1109/EDOCW.2015.22","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7310690","modelling semantics;ontologies;Unified Foundational Ontology;enterprise modelling","Ontologies;Semantics;Computational modeling;Tutorials;Conferences;Computer science;Electronic mail","","","","","IEEE","29 Oct 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Accurately annotating their functions is essential for understanding cellular mechanisms and developing therapies for complex diseases. Computational methods have been proposed as alternatives to labor-intensive and expensive experimental approaches. Existing computational methods have demonstrated that protein evolution information and Protein-Protein Interactions (PPIs) are essential for protein function prediction. However, traditional computational approaches for generating evolution information are time-consuming. On the other hand, proteins lacking interactions are ignored in previous studies. To address these limitations, we propose a novel deep learning framework, named DeepFMB, which incorporates multi-type biological knowledge. DeepFMB leverages a pre-trained protein language model to extract evolution information. Moreover, DeepFMB generates PPI-related features and orthology-related features using graph neural networks on the constructed PPI and orthology networks. Then, these multi-type features are fused adaptively for protein function prediction. Compared to eight state-of-the-art methods, DeepFMB outperforms all of them in terms of F-max and AUPR. Additionally, with the combination of sequence similarity-based inference, our predicted model predicts protein functions more accurately. Experimental results also validate the superior performance of our methods in predicting low-frequency GO terms.

Preliminary results show that simple clustering based methods using distributed word vectors from these language models outperforms methods using models like LSI in ontology learning for closed domains.","","978-1-5090-6167-9","10.1109/ICMLA.2016.0027","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7838131","Language Modeling;Deep Learning;Natural Language Processing;Ontology Learning;Word Vectors;Clustering;Latent Semantic Indexing","Ontologies;Context;Drugs;Diseases;Large scale integration;Context modeling;Semantics","","5","","29","IEEE","2 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As impressive as the majority of interactions with ChatGPT are, this large language model has a number of acknowledged shortcomings, which in several cases, may be directly related to how ChatGPT handles uncertainty. The objective of this paper is to pave the way to formal analysis of ChatGPT uncertainty handling. To this end, the ability of the Uncertainty Representation and Reasoning Framework (URREF) ontology is assessed, to support such analysis. Elements of structured experiments for reproducible results are identified. The dataset built varies Information Criteria of Correctness, Non-specificity, Self-confidence, Relevance and Inconsistency, and the Source Criteria of Reliability, Competency and Type. ChatGPT’s answers are analyzed along Information Criteria of Correctness, Non-specificity and Self-confidence. Both generic and singular information are sequentially provided. The outcome of this preliminary study is twofold: Firstly, we validate that the experimental setup is efficient in capturing aspects of ChatGPT uncertainty handling. Secondly, we identify possible modifications to the URREF ontology that will be discussed and eventually implemented in URREF ontology Version 4.0 under development.","","979-8-89034-485-4","10.23919/FUSION52260.2023.10224086","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10224086","Uncertainty evaluation;Ontology;Information quality;Source quality;Large Language Models;NLP","Uncertainty;Ontologies;Media;Chatbots;Cognition;Reliability;Disruptive technologies","","9","","36","","25 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This study is focused on drug discovery using the Generative AI model. In this paper, a system is proposed for providing drug descriptions from drug pill images. The system is implemented by utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in combination with computer vision to detect and provide detailed information about drugs from pill images. In the proposed system, the identification process begins by taking the medicinal drug pills and their cover images. Then, the image is converted into binary values using a standard built-in function. In addition, the target language for providing audio descriptions about the drugs is also used. Then, the Google Gemini LLM model is customized by using binary values of the image, target language, and ontology-based prompt engineering. As a result, the LLM model provides drug descriptions in text. Then, the textual description of the drug is converted into the target language audio format by using the Google Text to Speech Converter. The system is experimented by using 807 medicinal drug images which are collected from web resources. The performance of the system is measured by using accuracy. The system achieved an accuracy of 95.04% which is a little higher when compared with the current state-of-the-art model.","","979-8-3315-3496-7","10.1109/ICERCS63125.2024.10895371","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10895371","Drug Pill Identification;Generative AI;Large Language Models;Pharmaceutical Image Analysis;Multimodal Learning;Medical Text Analysis","Drugs;Accuracy;Text analysis;Computational modeling;System performance;Medical services;Streaming media;Internet;Text to speech;Biomedical imaging","","","","17","IEEE","27 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This will cause the businesses and organizations to confront a large diversity of data (i.e. waste amount, types, locations, etc.). The generated data is often stored and processed through manual or semi-manual methods by each business or organization. However, an automated method which can also interpret and integrate the diverse data in WM fields across different organizations is still in its infancy. Often, such data is not organized and falls short of reaching its full potential in facilitating coordinated management and enabling Circular Economy initiatives. In this paper, we aim to address this need through automated interpretation and integration of municipal waste data by applying semantic data modeling. Our approach proposes to capture the semantical description of entities in the WM process and their relations, which can appear between waste producers, authorities and consumers. Then, the obtained semantic model will facilitate and automate the required interpretation and integration of waste data, both for intra- and inter-organization scenarios.

This paper describes a model to represent the technical knowledge for the agriculture field operations as a task ontology that can be used with a domain ontology to build an application ontology for agriculture domain purposes. The field operations were analyzed to determine who are the task agents, agent roles, the input resources, task and sub-task decomposition, control-flow, task concepts, attributes and relations. As a result, a formal representation of the agriculture field operations is presented and a conceptual model was built using UML class and activity diagrams. The model consistency was verified in a case study of the sugar cane harvest operation.

Behavior is, in essence, transforming the structure associated with the system. As a language for the object-oriented paradigm, Unified Modeling Language (UML) offers constructs for both aspects, for example, class diagrams for the structural aspect and activity diagrams for the behavioral aspect. However, without obtaining directly executable models, in glass-box terms, or reasoning support, on the other hand, when software engineering is approached with ontologies, only constructs for structural aspects are provided to develop a directly executable model, thanks to their reasoning capability. However, there are no constructs or approaches for this paradigm’s specification or definition of behavior. This lack appears mainly in the early stages of the software engineering process, where there are no constructs similar to, e.g., the activity diagram in the object-oriented domain. Object Management Group (OMG) already addressed the transformation between the two paradigms in structural terms throughout Ontology Definition Metamodel (ODM) from UML to Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). However, there is no transformation of the object-oriented behavioral constructs into ontologies because they are not defined in the ontological paradigm. This paper addresses the definition of behavior in the ontology paradigm and the transformation of behavioral constructs between the two paradigms. The foundation of behavior specification is the flow concept, and the basis of this is the transformation of the structural model in an evaluative sense. Therefore, once the behavior has been defined in the ontology domain, the artifacts obtained throughout the life cycle are directly executable, and their validation and testing are automatic. With this approach, the life cycle is reduced to a modeling process. Thus, the resulting software engineering process improves features such as agility, simplicity, productivity, and formalism. The target audience for this work is the software engineering community, especially in the Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm approached from object-oriented and ontology perspectives. The evaluation of the proposed approach has been performed in the electric utilities, solving the problem of the validation flow for the interoperability process specified by the Common Grid Model Exchange Standard (CGMES) standard.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3412656","Department of Computer Systems and Software Engineering at the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia, Spain; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552698","Behavioral modeling;CIM for ENTSO-E (CGMES);directly executable;ontology RDF/RDFS/OWL/SHACL","Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Object oriented modeling;Resource description framework;Software engineering;OWL;Cognition;Behavioral sciences","","3","","49","CCBYNCND","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current techniques face significant challenges due to syntactical and structural heterogeneity. To address this, matching techniques often employ semantic similarity to identify correspondences. Traditional semantic matchers, however, rely on ontology matching tools or lexical databases, which often struggle when metamodels use different terminologies or hierarchical structures. Inspired by the contextual understanding capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), this paper explores the capability of GPT-4 potentials as a semantic matcher and alternative to existing methods for metamodel matching. However, metamodels can be large, which can overwhelm LLMs if provided in a single prompt, leading to reduced accuracy. Therefore, we propose prompting LLMs with fragments of the source and target metamodels, identifying correspondences through an iterative process. The fragments to be provided in the prompt are identified based on an initial mapping derived from their elements’ definitions. Through experiments with 10 metamodels, our results show that our LLMbased approach improves the accuracy of metamodel matching, achieving an average F-measure of $\approx 91 \%$, outperforming both the baseline and hybrid approaches, which have a maximum average F-measure of $\approx \mathbf{2 9 \%}$ and $\approx \mathbf{7 4 \%}$, respectively. Moreover, our approach surpasses single-prompt LLM-based matching, which has an average $\mathbf{F}$-measure of $\mathbf{8 0 \%}$, by approximately $\mathbf{1 1 \%}$.","2574-3864","979-8-3315-0183-9","10.1109/MSR66628.2025.00040","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11025595","Model-driven Engineering;Metamodel Matching;Domain-Specific Languages;Model Migration","Accuracy;Costs;Terminology;Databases;Large language models;Semantics;Ontologies;Model driven engineering;Software;Iterative methods","","","","43","IEEE","13 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The integration of these state-of-the-art technologies is fueled by the necessity to improve language models' capacity to comprehend context and make precise decisions. This research paper presents a novel approach to revolutionize the staffing and recruiting industry by integrating Knowledge Graph (KG) and Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP) to formulate an end-to-end QNLP training pipeline. The proposed solution consists of three interdependent subsystems that work in unison to construct contextual KG and train language models. The Information Extraction subsystem extracts semantic relationships and connections between entities from large and complex recruitment data to construct domain specific contextual KG. The QNLP model training pipeline subsystem, which is fed with domain-rich KG data, runs on Quantum Circuits, accelerates the training process by effectively incorporating high-dimensional features to the deep layers of language models. Finally, the Information Retrieval subsystem is based on semantic data taxonomy, retrieving contextual data from the KG for the trained language models to be implemented on various distinctive use cases in the staffing and recruiting industry. This solution provides a faster and more contextual approach to analyze recruitment data, empowering recruiters to concentrate on strategic tasks such as candidate engagement and client relationship building, ultimately leading to better business decision-making capabilities.","","979-8-3503-0709-2","10.1109/ICKG59574.2023.00011","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10412761","Artificial Intelligence (AI);Knowledge Graph (KG);Quantum Natural Language Processing (QNLP);Large Language Models (LLM);Contextual Information Extraction & Retrieval Systems","Training;Industries;Knowledge graphs;Natural language processing;Data models;Integrated circuit modeling;Context modeling","","3","","15","IEEE","1 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, poorly designed ontologies can lead to errors and performance issues. While systems engineering has standardized evaluation guidelines (e.g., ISO/IEC), ontology engineering lacks such standards, leading to various independent evaluation methods. One frequent issue among novice developers is the misuse of ontology restrictions, particularly ‘allValuesFrom’ and ‘someValuesFrom’, which can significantly impact the correctness and reliability of ontologies. However, existing studies have not adequately addressed effective methods for detecting such errors. To address this gap, we propose a context-aware verification framework utilizing large language models to detect and correct misuse in ontology restrictions. Unlike conventional methods, our framework integrates contextual descriptions derived from ontological axioms, enabling more accurate verification. Additionally, we introduce a clustering-based description generation method that systematically organizes contextual information, further enhancing verification accuracy. Experimental evaluation conducted on diverse ontology datasets suggests that contextual integration improves verification performance. Moreover, the clustering-based description generation improves restriction misuse detection and correction compared to traditional approaches. By automating ontology restriction verification, this study contributes significantly to enhancing the reliability of ontology evaluation and provides a foundation for developing more scalable and standardized verification techniques.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562560","Korea Research Institute for Defense Technology Planning and Advancement (KRIT); Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA), South Korea (Technology for Automated Generation and Verification of the Conceptual Models of the Mission Space, South Korea)(grant numbers:16-202-210-025); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10971367","Ontology evaluation;ontology restriction verification;text generation;clustering","Ontologies;Accuracy;Reliability;ISO Standards;IEC Standards;Translation;Software;Semantics;Scalability;Quality assessment","","","","42","CCBYNCND","21 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This paper examines how LLMs handle uncertainty by analyzing outcomes based on an atomic fusion and reasoning problem. We establish a point of reference using the simplest of fusion topologies to facilitate transparency and understanding of how LLMs align with established theories. The reasoning approaches of different LLMs with varying complexities are compared to established normative frameworks, providing insights into which formalism best aligns with LLM reasoning and assessing its soundness and consistency. A deviation function for assessment is developed, and the results indicate that the tested LLMs' reasoning under uncertainty does not consistently align with established theories, even for the simplest information fusion topologies.

In this work, we propose a multi-modal approach utilizing protein sequence and 3D structure.

The protein sequence is encoded into a feature vector using a pre-trained language model. The feature vectors extracted from the two modalities are fused and then fed to the neural network classifier to predict the protein interactions.

This crucial process predominantly takes place during task planning, prior to the actual performance of service tasks. Therefore, it is vital that the robot is capable of formulating object-specific action sequences through task planning. In this letter, we propose the Fine-Grained Task Planning (FGTP) framework, an innovative method that combines object ontology knowledge with Large Language Models (LLMs) to create detailed action sequences. The FGTP framework is uniquely designed to process both text descriptions of service tasks and images of relevant objects, enabling a thorough comprehension of object attributes essential for task execution. Moreover, we have developed a set of rules based on these attributes to assist in the robot's decision-making process. In scenarios where service tasks fail because the object is in an unsuitable state, our framework deploys a logic-based reasoning method, concentrating on object attributes to identify suitable substitutes. This process leverages a pre-established semantic map to locate these alternatives, thus enabling a transition back to standard task planning. Our evaluations, conducted in both the VirtualHome simulation environment and with the TIAGo real robot, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. This confirms our framework's capability to generate practical and implementable plans for various service tasks.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2024.3412593","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62273203); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2018YFB1307101); Taishan Scholars Program of Shandong Province(grant numbers:ts201511005); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10553231","Task planning;service robotics","Task analysis;Planning;Ontologies;Service robots;Robot kinematics;Object recognition","","2","","30","IEEE","11 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Following this strategy, over the last decade, the foundational ontology UFO has been applied to create the OntoUML modeling language, an ontologically well founded version of UML. In the current work we present extensions to UFO in order to improve the ontological foundations concerning value spaces by employing the notion Semantic Reference Spaces.

The approach circumvents the need for extensive pre-training or fine-tuning, thereby enabling rapid development and deployment in a domain characterized by data scarcity. The methodology begins with the construction of a knowledge graph, which involves a comprehensive ontology design, followed by knowledge extraction from unstructured text sources, and culminates in knowledge representation and storage in a structured format. Subsequently, the framework facilitates dynamic risk understanding and analysis, encompassing risk factor identification, risk event inference, and the analysis of complex relationships between these elements, all supported by the structured knowledge base. Finally, the system provides knowledge-based risk interpretation and decision-making support, generating explanations for risk events, assessing their potential impacts, and offering actionable recommendations to stakeholders. By employing carefully crafted prompts and the inherent natural language processing capabilities of GPT-4, the framework facilitates the extraction of entities and relationships from unstructured textual data, effectively populating the knowledge graph. This knowledge graph, representing entities, attributes, and relationships pertinent to cross-border pipeline risks, serves as a foundation for dynamic risk assessment. This method presents a scalable, data-efficient approach tailored to the specialized domain of cross-border pipeline risk management, particularly advantageous in contexts with limited resources. The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of LLMs, specifically GPT-4, in conjunction with knowledge graph methodologies, to advance risk management practices in complex, data-sparse domains.","","979-8-3315-1091-6","10.1109/AEMCSE65292.2025.11042435","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11042435","LLM;China-Russia pipeline;knowledge graph","Large language models;Pipelines;Knowledge based systems;Zero shot learning;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Safety;Risk management;Stakeholders;Software engineering","","","","11","IEEE","24 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end, automatically learning vector representation for knowledge of an ontology i.e., ontology embedding has been widely investigated. Numerous papers have been published on ontology embedding, but a lack of systematic reviews hinders researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of this field. To bridge this gap, we write this survey paper, which first introduces different kinds of semantics of ontologies and formally defines ontology embedding as well as its property of faithfulness. Based on this, it systematically categorizes and analyses a relatively complete set of over 80 papers, according to the ontologies they aim at and their technical solutions including geometric modeling, sequence modeling and graph propagation.

Predicting the functions of isoforms is an essential topic in bioinformatics as it can provide valuable insights into the intricate mechanisms of gene regulation and biological processes. Conventionally, gene function labels are standardized in Gene Ontology (GO) terms. However, traditional methods for predicting isoform function are largely limited by the absence of isoform-specific labels, sparse annotations, and the vast number of GO terms. To address these issues, we propose HANIso, a deep learning-based method for isoform function prediction. HANIso leverages a pretrained protein language model to extract features from protein sequences. It also integrates heterogeneous information, such as isoform sequence features, GO annotations, and isoform interaction data, using a Heterogeneous Graph Attention Network (HAN). This allows the model to learn the importance of different sources of information and their semantic relationships through the attention mechanism. Our method can predict function labels at both the gene level and isoform level. We conduct experiments on two species datasets, and the results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing methods on both AUROC and AUPRC.

Determining such reminders implies decision-making, since the actions' flow (behavior) usually involves probabilistic branches. An automated system needs to decide which of the next actions is the best one for the user in a given situation. Problems of this nature involve uncertainty levels that have to be dealt with. Many approaches to this problem exploit statistical data only, thus ignoring important semantic data as, for instance, are provided by Ontologies. However, ontologies do not support reasoning over uncertainty natively. In this paper, we present a probabilistic semantic model that enables reasoning over uncertainty without losing semantic information. This model will be exemplified by an extension of the Human Behavior Monitoring and Support [HBMS] approach that provides a conceptual model for representing the user's behavior and its context in her/his living environment. The performance of this approach was evaluated using real data collected from a smart home prototype equipped with sensors.

Ontologies are a promising approach for formal knowledge representation and their number is growing rapidly. The semantic linking of these ontologies is a necessary prerequisite for establishing interoperability between the large number of services that structure the data with these ontologies. Consequently, the alignment of ontologies becomes a central issue when building a worldwide Semantic Web. There is a need to develop automatic or at least semi-automatic techniques to reduce the burden of manually creating and maintaining alignments. Ontologies are seen as a solution to data heterogeneity on the Web. However, the available ontologies are themselves a source of heterogeneity. On the Web, there are multiple ontologies that refer to the same domain, and with that comes the challenge of a given graph-based system using multiple ontologies whose taxonomy is different, but the semantics are the same. This can be overcome by aligning the ontologies or by finding the correspondence between their components.In this paper, we propose a method for indexing ontologies as a support to a solution for ontology alignment based on a neural network. In this process, for each semantic resource we combine the graph based representations from the RDF2vec model, together with the text representation from the BERT model in order to capture the semantic and structural features. This methodology is evaluated using the FoodOn and OntoFood ontologies, based on the Food Onto Map alignment dataset, which contains 155 unique and validly aligned resources. Using these limited resources, we managed to obtain accuracy of 74% and F1 score of 75% on the test set, which is a promising result that can be further improved in future. Furthermore, the methodology presented in this paper is both robust and ontology-agnostic. It can be applied to any ontology, regardless of the domain.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020417","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020417","Ontology Alignment;Natural language processing;Text representation;Embeddings;Data normalization;Data linking","Training;Semantic Web;Semantics;Neural networks;Taxonomy;Ontologies;Big Data","","2","","47","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Researchers typically use automatic analysis methods to evaluate the model limitations, such as statistics on stereotypical words. Since different types of issues are embedded in the model parameters, the development of automated methods that capture all relevant aspects remains a challenge. To tackle this challenge, we propose a visual analytics approach that supports the exploratory analysis of text sequences generated by causal language models. Our approach enables users to specify starting prompts and effectively groups the resulting text sequences. To this end, we leverage a unified, ontology-driven embedding space, serving as a shared foundation for the thematic concepts present in the generated text sequences. Visual summaries provide insights into various levels of granularity within the generated data. Among others, we propose a novel comparison visualization that slices the embedding space and represents the differences between two prompt outputs in a radial layout.

Recently, many RDB2RDF mapping tools, relying on mapping languages such as W3C's R2RML, provide the ability to view existing relational databases in the RDF model, and offer a virtual SPARQL endpoint over the mapped relational data. However, these mapping languages require the information provider to expose the underlying information structure, and to reconstruct the Web site. In this paper we propose a modeling language, WF2OML, for mapping Web forms to OWL or RDFS ontologies. Based on the WF2OML mapping, SPARQL endpoint queries against the back-end database of the Web form can be achieved. We introduce WF2OML, propose the architecture and algorithm design ideas of a WF2OML-based SPARQL query system, and demonstrate a mapping example using our implemented prototype.

The resulting KG structures the curriculum and links it to the domain models. We evaluate our approach through qualitative expert feedback and quantitative graph quality metrics. Domain experts validated the relevance and accuracy of the model, while the graph quality metrics measured the structural properties of our KG. Our results show that the LLM-assisted graph completion approach enhances the ability to connect related courses across disciplines to personalize the learning experience. Expert feedback also showed high acceptance of the proposed collaborative approach for concept extraction and classification.","2165-9567","979-8-3315-3949-8","10.1109/EDUCON62633.2025.11016377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11016377","Higher education;Knowledge graph (KG);Large language models (LLM);curriculum model;domain model;Recommender systems","Measurement;Embedded systems;Large language models;Pipelines;Collaboration;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Stakeholders;Field programmable gate arrays;Recommender systems","","2","","13","IEEE","3 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Each view expresses the elements and relationships of a system from the perspective of specific system concerns relevant to one or more of its stakeholders. As a result, each view needs to expressed in the architecture description language that best suits its concerns. Therefore, an enterprise architecture may be described using a set of different languages. However, current enterprise architecture modelling languages display two issues in this setting. First, they lack mechanisms to integrate multiple architecture description languages. This issue hinders the specification of views using different languages. Second, enterprise architecture models lack quantitative analysis support. This paper describes an ontology-based approach in order to have a modular ontology for the enterprise architecture domain, to specify and integrate multiple architecture modelling languages and to analyse the resulting integrated models. The approach relies on transformations between an upper-domain ontology based on the ArchiMate language and on a set of domain-specific ontologies to deal with the specific architecture modelling languages. The resulting models are quantifiable in the sense they provide the means to assess the consistency of the enterprise architecture models and to analyse their structure. The applicability of the approach is shown through a case study and the correctness of the ontology is shown by a set of competency questions.","2325-6605","978-1-4799-3048-7","10.1109/EDOCW.2013.8","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6690528","enterprise architecture;ontology;integration;modular ontology;ArchiMate;OWL","Ontologies;Computer architecture;OWL;Analytical models;Cognition;Software;Licenses","","11","","22","IEEE","23 Dec 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The intent of IE is to produce a knowledge base i.e. organize the information in a way that it is useful to people and arrange the information in a semantic way so that algorithms can make certain useful inferences from it. Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a sub-task of IE which finds and classifies the names/entities. Once these Named Entities (NE) are extracted, they can then be indexed and made searchable, relations can be derived, questions can be answered and many more. NER techniques are different for different domains, because of the uniqueness that exists in each of the domains, although the process depends on a number of fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) steps such as tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, parsing and model building. As an example, NER in the medical domain involves handling of a number of vital tasks such as identification of medical terms, attributes such as negation, severity, identification of relationships between entities and mapping terms in the document to concepts in domain specific ontologies. There is also a heavy dependence on domain specific resources such as medical dictionaries and ontologies such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)[34]. In this paper, we focus on NER in the clinical domain. In particular, we will focus on the NER challenges and the qualitative analysis of clinical reports on the approaches we took for the named entities: anatomies, findings, location qualifier, and procedures.","","978-1-4673-9005-7","10.1109/BigData.2016.7840814","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7840814","Natural Language Processing;Machine Learning;Text Analytics;Deep Learning;Ontologies;Language Modelling;Long short-term memory","Medical diagnostic imaging;Dictionaries;Unified modeling language;Medical services;Ontologies;Data mining","","37","1","45","IEEE","6 Feb 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, directly applying LLMs, even with large token-sized prompts, does not achieve the task planning performance required for an industrial-grade domain-specific use-case (DSU). This work aims to overcome the obstacles of a robotic task planner for DSUs by introducing a novel planning framework, LLM-RSPF (Large Language Model-based Robotic System Planning Framework). Central to the LLM-RSPF is a novel robotic system ontology that organizes the components of the robotic system in a coherent and a systematic manner. The ontology empowers the LLM-RSP F to efficiently capture a contextual representation of the DSU using the LLMs. Subsequently, the research introduces a LLM-tuning regimen referred as chain of hierarchical thought (CoHT), specifically crafted to complement the proposed system ontology. Integrating these two components, the LLM-RSPF aims to enhance the accuracy, robustness, and throughput of a robotic system in a cost-effective manner. In addition, the research presents an empirical methodology to generate the LLM-tuning dataset size for a guaranteed performance. The LLM-RSPF is validated on a retail order-fulfillment use-case thereby, illustrating the efficacy of the framework. Through rigorous evaluation, the LLM-RSPF demonstrates exceptional performance on the generated dataset, effectively meeting the DSU objectives.","2642-9381","979-8-3315-1083-1","10.1109/WACV61041.2025.00707","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10943742","coht;domain-specific use-case;large language model;robotic system ontology;task planning","Solid modeling;Accuracy;Three-dimensional displays;Systematics;Service robots;Ontologies;Throughput;Robustness;Planning;Robots","","","","24","IEEE","8 Apr 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Given that EA provides support for the IT environment by simulating alignment between dynamic business architectures, heterogeneous application systems and incongruent technologies, the need to ensure validation of conceptualized EA models has become also critical. As a relatively new discipline, its disparate and widespread methodologies makes it even more challenging to adopt a generic approach in which models can be verified sequel to the unavailability of unified EA modelling languages able to describe a wide range of Information Technology domains. This paper seeks to present an approach for addressing this challenge through the use of ontologies and queries based on constraints specified in the model's motivation taxonomy. The paper is experimental research-based and grounds its hypothesis on initial model created using the ArchiMate modelling language. By transforming its conceptual metamodel into a model instance, a process which can be achieved irrespective of the modeling language used in the design of the EA, it represents extracted triples as resource description framework schema (RDFS) by mapping the model artefacts directly into classes and slots using a more conventional web ontology language. The generated RDF is then queried using Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL) adopting the Behavior Driven Development (BDD) concept. A case study of the Student Internship Program (SIP) is deployed to translate information from business needs to IT solutions encapsulating a view of abstraction of the EA. The paper also proposes an implementation of the approach using an open source platform that allows construction of domain models and knowledge-based applications with ontologies and is a contribution towards effective validation of EA through taxonomy decomposition, systematic generation of testable EA artifacts, creation of structural triples of model elements and alignment of motivational goals to business behavior specifications.","","978-1-4799-3392-1","10.1109/ISKO-Maghreb.2013.6728200","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6728200","Ontology;Enterprise Architecture;Metamodel;Model;Viewpoints;Resource Description Framework;Schema and Query Language;ArchiMate;Validation","Ontologies;Business;Resource description framework;Computer architecture;Semantics;Collaboration;Data models","","","","26","IEEE","30 Jan 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Hence, understanding the application domain is critical to the success of information systems development. To support domain understanding, the application domain is represented in conceptual models. The correctness of conceptual models can affect the development outcome and prevent costly rework during later development stages. This paper proposes a method to restrict the syntax of a modeling language to ensure that only possible configurations of a domain can be modeled, thus increasing the likelihood of creating correct domain models. The proposed method, based on domain ontologies, captures relationships among domain elements via constraints on the language metamodel, thus restricting the set of statements about the domain that can be generated with the language. In effect, this method creates domain specific modeling languages from more generic ones. The method is demonstrated using the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Specifically, it is applied to the subset of UML dealing with object behavior and its applicability is demonstrated on a specific modeling example.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2005.15","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1392718","Index Terms- Analysis;methodologies;specification;object-oriented design methods;design concepts;CASE;ontology.","Object oriented modeling;Context modeling;Unified modeling language;Software design;Application software;Ontologies;Design methodology;Information systems;Computer aided software engineering;Software systems","","52","","62","IEEE","14 Feb 2005","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Due to the rapid growth of unstructured data on the web, studying how to automatically get ontology from unstructured text is important. Therefore, ontology learning (OL) is an important process in the business world. It involves finding and extracting concepts from the text so that these concepts can be used for things such as information retrieval. Unfortunately, learning ontology is not easy for some reasons, and there has not been much research on how to automatically learn a domain-specific ontology from data.Ontology Studying Arabic text is not as developed as learning Latin text. There is almost no automated support for using Arabic literary knowledge in semantically enabled systems. Machine learning (ML) has proven beneficial in numerous fields, including text mining. By employing neural language models such as AraBERT, it is possible to obtain word embeddings as distributed word representations from textual input using machine learning. However, the application of machine learning to aid the development of Arabic ontology is largely unexplored. This research examines the performance of AraBERT for ontology learning tasks in Arabic. Early performance results as an application of Arabic ontology learning are promising. In this research, we provide a method for populating an existing ontology with instance information extracted from the input natural language text. This prototype has achieved an information extraction accuracy of 91%.","","979-8-3503-8306-5","10.1109/ISAS60782.2023.10391548","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10391548","Arabic Ontology;Natural language Processing (NLP);Ontology;Ontology Learning (OL);Semantic Web;semantic representation","Text mining;Semantics;Natural languages;Prototypes;Machine learning;Ontologies;Information retrieval","","1","","37","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A corpus formed of several ontologies in the agricultural domain was constructed. SPARQL queries were used to extract the required data from existing ontologies. And a machine learning technique, the Word2Vec, was employed for ontology reuse process to measure concepts similarity against the existing ontologies. The experimental results showed that the proposed methodology successfully detected previously seen vocabularies during the training on the data in the ontology corpus, and retrieved other similar concepts from the ontologies as well as their degree of similarity (Cosin similarity). Furthermore, the proposed model could process over two million terms in around one minute, reflecting its effectiveness in this context. The proposed method would be useful to ontology and knowledge engineers to conduct a preliminary investigation about which existing ontologies are suitable for reuse in the process of developing new ontologies. Other applications of the proposed method may include ontology alignment to measure the degree of similarity between existing ontologies.","","978-1-6654-8422-0","10.1109/icABCD54961.2022.9856059","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9856059","automated ontology reuse;NLP;Word2Vec;artificial neural networks","Training;Semantic Web;Knowledge engineering;Heart;Vocabulary;Machine learning;Ontologies","","2","","32","IEEE","22 Aug 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address this issue, we propose CoFunDST, which is trained on domain-agnostic QA datasets and directly uses candidate choices of slot-values as knowledge for zero-shot dialogue-state generation, based on a T5 pre-trained language model.

Achieving effective individualization relies on dynamic adaptation of the learning path, typically facilitated by recommender systems. These systems offer personalized suggestions, commonly employing content-based or collaborative filtering approaches. However, traditional recommender systems often lack consideration of the semantics of learning elements. To address this limitation, ontology-based recommender systems integrate semantic modeling, establishing additional connections within a domain to enhance precision and context in recommendations. Notably, these systems mitigate the cold start problem and are particularly advantageous in learning environments with limited data. While videos are prevalent in learning platforms, their unstructured nature poses challenges for processing. This paper introduces an innovative approach, leveraging Large Language Models, specifically GPT, to extract metadata from learning videos. The proposed method intelligently augments videos and links them to a domain ontology, enabling the integration of videos into ontology-based recommender systems. The application of this approach is demonstrated through a case study in software engineering education, showcasing its potential to enhance individualized learning experiences in specific domains.

Sequence-based methods, one of the computational methods, have been developed for extending functional annotations to fast-growing sequence databases. We propose a novel sequence-based hierarchy-aware method, namely GCL-GO. GCL-GO applies a protein language model to represent sequences, applies graph contrastive learning to represent GO terms, and then predicts protein functions by combining these two features. By contrasting the GO graph and semantic features of GO terms, GCL-GO has generalizability and scalability by accurately embedding the features of GO terms while relying less on training data. We also suggest GCL-GO+, which combines a sequence similarity-based method with GCLGO, to improve performance. GCL-GO+ outperforms sequence-based competing methods on both the CAFA3 and the TALE datasets. Furthermore, GCL-GO and GCL-GO+ demonstrate functional generalization and scalability potential by having the best performance on new GO terms or on GO terms annotated infrequently in the training dataset.

The integration of Ontology and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents a transformative approach for enhancing recommender systems by improving contextual intelligence, personalization, and explainability. Traditional recommendation algorithms often suffer from data sparsity, cold-start problems, and limited semantic understanding, which hinder their ability to deliver highly relevant and interpretable suggestions. This research provides an exhaustive exploration of how ontology-driven knowledge representation can be seamlessly combined with LLMs to refine user-item interactions, enrich embeddings, and improve reasoning in recommendation pipelines. We propose a hybrid framework where ontological structures encode domain-specific relationships while LLMs process, infer, and enhance recommendations through contextual embeddings.This synergy enables semantic-aware recommendations, explainable item suggestions, and adaptive learning mechanisms that adjust based on user behavior and external context. Furthermore, we investigate novel ontology injection techniques, including knowledge graph-based reinforcement, to improve long-tail item exposure and enhance recommendation diversity. Through rigorous evaluation on real-world datasets, we demonstrated how ontology-LLM fusion significantly outperforms baseline models in accuracy, novelty, and interpretability. This study establishes a foundation for the next generation of context-aware, knowledge-enhanced recommender systems that leverage LLMs for reasoning and ontologies for structured knowledge representation, paving the way for more intelligent and user-centric recommendations.","","979-8-3315-9848-8","10.1109/RMKMATE64874.2025.11042856","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11042856","Context-Aware Recommendation Systems;Computational intelligence;LLM;Ontology;semantic-aware","Accuracy;Heavily-tailed distribution;Social networking (online);Semantics;Diversity reception;Ontologies;Cognition;Graph neural networks;Stock markets;Recommender systems","","","","27","IEEE","25 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Large language models (LLMs) offer powerful language processing and generalizability but suffer from hallucinations when handling specialized domains. To address these limitations, this study proposes a KG-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) approach to develop a domain-specific question-answering (Q&A) in DfAM. By integrating structured knowledge from a DfAM KG with the strengths of LLMs, the proposed approach improves response accuracy and relevance.

The paper discusses an approach of a context rich chatbot that can identify the customer’s mode of thinking using a restaurant ontology that suggests relevant restaurants and foods. Most importantly the defined methodology will use a hybrid version of knowledge bases along with a two-way bind to the primary knowledge base. The chatbot will proceed to find relationships in the ontology by tracing concept definitions and properties while feeding information from the database.

Some works explain the inclusion of ontology for SPL such as having feature diagram in ontology language. The inclusion benefits to produce an information system automatically. On the other side, the executable modelling language such as Abstract Behavioural Specification (ABS) can be utilized to implement the feature diagram for distributed object-oriented systems. The trend of ABS expands to accommodate microservices-based software variabilities, that is ABS Microservices Framework. The Framework allows to build different services for different devices who consume the data from ABS. However, these two area of research have not been integrated.

However, the slow pace of ontology updates and the lack of contextual adaptability present significant challenges, leading to outdated and irrelevant information for educators, learners, and industry professionals. This paper explores the potential of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with knowledge engineering to accelerate the process of updating ontologies like ESCO.

This paper proposes a middle graph-based formal model language, W-graph, to help retrieve an ontology from existed relational database instances. The main idea is to execute SQL procedures to retrieve the semantic information of the database instances, transform semi-automatically the result sets into the medium model, then transform the model into the ontology complete automatically.

Communities appear to play an important role in the functional properties of complex networks. Being able to annotate the identified the community structure in a biological network can help us to understand better the structure and dynamics of biological systems. Traditional method such as gene ontology (GO) provides information about the functionality of gene products, but they are not enough to annotate community as for only limited number of proteins in the database, limited protein properties available for annotation and the inability to annotate a group of gene products as a whole. Thus, we present an ontology based mixture language model approach to annotate protein community. Compared to traditional method, we have the following three advantages. First, biomedical literature mining brings much richer information than existed gene databases. Second, the mixture language model can help ""purify"" the document by eliminating some background noise. Third, using domain ontology, we extract biological concept and concept pairs from abstracts. Biological concept is more meaningful than word or multi-word phrases. Moreover, using concept pairs can deliver much more information and serve as evidence of annotation results. We test our approach on four communities SAGA-SRB, CCR-NOT, RFC and ARP2/3, detected from dataset of interactions for Saccharomyces cerevisae from the general repository for interaction datasets (GRID). Annotation results provide a very coherent indication of functionality of each community","","0-7695-2727-2","10.1109/BIBE.2006.253310","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4019635","","Text mining;Proteins;Ontologies;Biological system modeling;Databases;Complex networks;Biological systems;Background noise;Data mining;Abstracts","","1","","41","IEEE","4 Dec 2006","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This work proposes a system for the management and evaluation of LO. Primarily, this work defines an ontology to support the management and evaluation of LO via Knowledge Graphs (KG). The KG links individual LO with individual assessment items. Two state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing models, BERT and ChatGPT, are evaluated in respect to their effectiveness in automating this linking. This data allows the educational professional to reflect on how well their assessments match the course's LO. The second part of this system harnesses student data to measure performance in relation to LO. In this Work-in-Progress paper, the system is prototyped and tested on the midterm results of a course in the Software Engineering curriculum. Student performance is documented in relation to each assessment question on the exams to measure student mastery of course material. Through this approach, courses can be evaluated and improved to deliver better quality education to all students.

The related activities are performed throughout the entire lifecycle and require sharing information among tools of the different product lifecycle phases. When extending collaboration of PLM with services as integrated within a PSS, the physical product is linked with a vastly extended universe of information during the PSS lifecycle. To achieve robust and maintainable PSS the interoperability must be fulfilled between the physical products related data sources and the relevant services. To meet that end, we use ontologies to define a formal semantic for information sources and targets. Each tool or data source can use its own ontology independently of the other tools and sources, creating the potential of an unmanageable universe of data. Yet, the benefit is that components of the PSS have weak dependencies among them which leads to an open and flexible system that can easily evolve and adapt. This paper focuses on the provision of ontology driven services including the transformation of product related data into different ontologies and the aggregation of different data source specific ontologies to a holistic PSS universe with no specific ontology in its core. We present two approaches that implement ontology mediation (also termed ""semantic mediation"") as a variant of ontology matching since the level of matching can be rather complex. The application of this technology is also demonstrated in related domains, showing its potential when applied in PSS that is presently an ongoing research within the PSYMBIOSYS EU project. In consequence, the applicable data integration and ontology matching approaches are the hand tools to instantiate sustainable PSS into the market.","2472-9647","978-1-5090-4623-2","10.1109/SYSCON.2017.7934810","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7934810","Semantic Mediation;Ontology Mediation;Heterogeneous data management;Ontologies in Product Service Systems;large-scale systems Integration","Ontologies;Tools;Mediation;Interoperability;Semantics;OWL;Resource description framework","","10","","24","IEEE","29 May 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To provide more choices of process modelling language to users from different enterprises in distributed modelling, and to resolve consequent interoperability problems of heterogeneous enterprise models, meta-model ontologies of several modelling languages are built separately using Web Ontology Language (OWL) as common meta-meta-model. Model transmission can be implemented by translating models into OWL files and parsing them. Model transformation between different modelling languages can be implemented by ontology mapping between these meta-models in OWL format. Structural correspondences of the meta-models are mapped directly by declaring a class in one meta-model ontology equivalent to a class in another. More complex transformations are specified by generation rules. Models in OWL format act as intermedium to avoid an n2 mapping specification by bidirectional mapping with models built with different modelling languages. Transformation of following modelling languages is implemented: IDEF3, UML activity diagrams, and a graphic modelling method based on IDEF0 and swimlane in UML. The architecture of the distributed modelling tool based on this interoperability is given. Taking advantage of OWL, this model interoperability method can realize transmission and transformation of different modelling languages and provide users with more choices in distributed modelling for efficiency.","0537-9989","0-86341-696-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4752250","Interoperability;model transformation;OWL;meta-model;ontology mapping","","","","","","","19 Jan 2009","","","IET","IET Conferences"

Therefore, it is essential that domain experts are able to understand and reason using the models' content. In other words, it is important that conceptual models are cognitively tractable. However, it is unavoidable that when the information of the represented domain grows, so does the size and complexity of the artifacts and models that represent them. For this reason, more sophisticated techniques for complexity management in ontology-driven conceptual models, need to be developed. Some approaches are based on the notion of model modularization. In this paper, we follow the work on model modularization to present an approach for view extraction for the ontology-driven conceptual modeling language OntoUML. We provide a formal definition for ontological views over OntoUML conceptual models that completely leverages on the ontologically well-grounded real-world semantics of that language.

To enhance reuse in BPM, significant research efforts have been made on the development of methods and languages in order to support variability modeling. However, there is no single standard for modeling variability in configurable process models. Each modeling language integrating variability proposes its own method for representing variability, and different representations are used to express the same variability concepts. In addition to that, human intervention is still mandatory in order to create, configure and evolve configurable process models. With semantic annotations and the usage of ontology, these tasks could be automated.

This paper proposes a middle graph-based formal model language, W-graph, a bridge between relational databases and ontologies, which abstracts semantic information from relational database instances semi-automatically and then generates an OWL ontology automatically. This method not only maps relational database schemata to ontologies, but also populates ontologies with data stored in databases.

IBM Semantic Mediation Container (SMC) is a tool interoperability platform, allowing mediation and synchronization among models in different languages based on their ontologies. We propose integrating into SMC the ability to translate Object-Process Methodology (OPM), the emerging ISO 19450 Standard, which provides a holistic view of the system's function, structure, and behavior.

Wargames, traditionally military tools for simulating conflicts and decision-making, have gained prominence in civilian applications, including business, cybersecurity, disaster management, and critical infrastructure protection. Despite their utility, designing wargames is a time-intensive process with significant challenges, such as scenario creation and decision modeling, necessitating structured and systematic approaches. This research formalizes wargame design through ontology-driven conceptual modeling, structuring its key concepts, characteristics, and elements. Ontologies provide a structured representation of knowledge, facilitating communication, knowledge management, and collaborative design. As a result, we developed core ontologies for wargame design based on the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO) and implemented them using OntoUML. Our innovation lies in analyzing wargame design processes across various countries and military organizations to develop a comprehensive reference model for wargame design. Additionally, we are the first to apply UFO for conceptual modeling of the wargame domain. These ontologies enhance wargame design by fostering standardization, adaptability, and support for intelligent systems, enabling dynamic and responsive scenarios.

However, distant supervision (DS) is often limited by coarse annotations and insufficient contextual awareness, leading to relational ambiguity and introducing noise in the labeled results. Moreover, although one can optimize the classifiers in DS-RE models through weight updates, the static nature of the guiding rules for such adjustments often falls short when addressing the challenges posed by diverse non-taxonomic relations and complex noise patterns in datasets. In this paper, we propose a DS-RE framework that capitalizes on non-taxonomic relations and a self-optimizing mechanism. We define a set of consistent DS relation candidates and combine DS with a LLM to enhance the perception of entities’ contextual states during the DS process. Then, we design a Self-Optimizing Ontology-Enhanced Non-taxonomic Relation Extraction Model (SO-NRE). The model incorporates additional entity-relation knowledge to enhance the semantic depth of Non-taxonomic relation ontologies and uses an adaptive dynamic scheduling mechanism to refine the classification strategy through iterations informed by self-perception outcomes. The experimental results show that the improved DS annotation workflow has enhanced accuracy, and SO-NRE outperforms mainstream baselines in RE performance.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10650745","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10650745","Distantly Supervised Relation Extraction;Non-taxonomic Relation;LLM;Self-Optimization","Adaptation models;Accuracy;Annotations;Large language models;Noise;Semantics;Neural networks","","2","","30","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To date, the implementation of semantic services has remained minute both in academia and industry. This is commonly attributed to barriers, such as the complex and heterogeneous semantic description languages, and a lack of mature methods and unified tools that aim to facilitate the development of such services. Moreover, the current solutions that assert to facilitate the development of semantic services are fragmented (i.e. developers are required to use a combination of disconnected tools to realize semantic services). This usually leads to a number of challenges, such as prolonged service development time. Furthermore, existing semantic service development platforms are tightly-coupled to specific semantic description languages, leading to restrictive development environments. This paper proposes a generic and unified approach for designing and developing semantic web services exploiting the Eclipse platform. The key is in using common techniques such as UML - for modelling a variety of semantic services' artefacts, and Acceleo - for automatic code generations of semantic services' artefacts. The main contributions in the proposed solution are: (1) support for the specification and generation of semantic services using multiple semantic description languages, (2) seamless modelling and development of services within a unified environment, and (3) minimization of the barriers associated with the development of semantic services through complexity hiding; decoupling; and extensibility.","","978-1-908320-08-7","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6470919","Semantic Web Services;UML;Acceleo;Eclipse;WSMO;OWL-S","Unified modeling language;Semantics;Ontologies;Syntactics","","1","","29","","11 Mar 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Current DST approaches rely on a predefined domain ontology, a fact that limits their effective usage for large scale conversational agents, where the DST constantly needs to be interfaced with ever-increasing services and APIs. Focused towards overcoming this drawback, we propose a domain-aware dialogue state tracker, that is completely data-driven and it is modeled to predict for dynamic service schemas, including zero-shot domains. Unlike approaches that propose separate models for prediction of intents, requested slots, slot status, categorical slots and non-categorical slots, we propose a single model in an end-to-end architecture. The proposed model utilizes domain and slot information to extract both domain and slot specific representations from a given dialogue, and then uses such representations to predict the values of the corresponding slot in a given domain. Integrating this mechanism with pretrained language models, our approach can effectively learn semantic relations and effectively perform transfer learning between domains or zero-shot tracking for domains not present in training.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2021.3054309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9335254","Dialogue state tracking;multi-domain dialogue systems;zero-shot tracking;end-to-end","Predictive models;Bit error rate;Task analysis;Ontologies;Virtual assistants;Semantics;Training data","","8","","26","IEEE","25 Jan 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

With the rapid development of high-throughput technologies, an abundance of proteins are discovered. However, the gap between proteins and function annotations is still huge. To accelerate the process of protein function prediction, some computational methods taking advantage of multiple data have been proposed. Among these methods, the deep-learning-based methods are currently the most popular for their capability of learning information automatically from raw data. However, due to the diversity and scale difference between data, it is challenging for existing deep learning methods to capture related information from different data effectively. In this paper, we introduce a deep learning method that can adaptively learn information from protein sequences and biomedical literature, namely DeepAF. DeepAF first extracts the two kinds of information by using different extractors, which are built based on pre-trained language models and can capture rudimentary biological knowledge. Then, to integrate those information, it performs an adaptive fusion layer based on a Cross-attention mechanism that considers the knowledge of mutual interactions between two information. Finally, based on the mixed information, DeepAF utilizes logistic regression to obtain prediction scores. The experimental results on the datasets of two species (i.e., Human and Yeast) show that DeepAF outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2022.3221988","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62276043); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT22ZD205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9950327","Protein function prediction;deep learning;multiple data;pre-trained language models;cross-attention mechanism","Proteins;Protein engineering;Data mining;Biological system modeling;Amino acids;Semantics;Predictive models","Humans;Proteins;Amino Acid Sequence;Saccharomyces cerevisiae","4","","38","IEEE","14 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the specialized nature of the reports, the complexity of the contents, and the high accuracy requirements of the results pose significant challenges to the structuring task. In this paper, we develop an LLM-based method to extract structure information from medical report narratives. Defining the structuring problem as mapping the narrative reports to the domain ontology, we design a framework to develop specialized LLMs that automatically learn and establish the mappings. At the core of this framework are report partitioning and interactive training data generation modules are. By separating complete reports into logically independent segments and training the LLMs on these segments independently, the trained LLMs can accurately capture the semantic relationships within each segment. Additionally, we explore different LLMs and formulate a simplistic scoring method to compare their accuracy, enabling us to select the best-performing model. Experimental evaluation on a real-world breast ultrasound report dataset demonstrates that our method achieves high accuracy with a small training dataset (400 samples). Specifically, the accuracy of structural information extraction and the attribute-value matching accuracy both exceed 96%.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-8622-6","10.1109/BIBM62325.2024.10822688","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10822688","Medical examination reports;Large language models;Report structuring","Training;Accuracy;Ultrasonic imaging;Semantics;Training data;Medical services;Ontologies;Information retrieval;Data mining;Standards","","","","18","IEEE","10 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"NextGen and SESAR moving towards ontology-based software development","E. Gringinger; D. Eier; D.

Similar to SESAR, NextGen right now runs the risk to specify ATM systems based on architectures already out-of-date. While current functionality is based on historical grown technical restrictions, a performance-based and most efficient approach requires new paradigms and eventually has to lead to a balanced approach to prevent over-optimizing one area at the expense of others. The new approach should be based on semantically enriched service models allowing easier development and modular applications for multiple domains. This paper describes an ontology based multi-domain software development approach called Ontology-Based-Control-Room-Framework (ONTOCOR) featuring high software code re-usage and rapid development. It focuses on improving efficiency and increasing the code reusability in order to achieve SESAR's and NextGen's claim for a performance-based and cost-efficient system. The main goal is using semantic technologies to enhance software development in ATM and further, to define tasks with enough similarity to allow applicability in different domains. ONTOCOR uses semantic standards and tools, and seamless information interchange. As described in the European Air Traffic Management Master Plan, “The Information Management Work Package (...) defines the ATM Information Reference Model and the Information Service model (...) by establishing a framework, which defines seamless information interchange between all providers and users of shared ATM information”. A specific example to implement inter domain, is the European ATM Information Reference Model (AIRM). In general, domain independent implementation of components is a future goal and EUROCONTROL defines AIRM as a model, which contains all of the ATM information to be shared in a semantic way. The paper will discuss a first case study for ontology-based modeling and development, a service for digital notices to airmen (NOTAM). Fast information distribution and retrieval are key elements together with service modeling and definitions according to Enterprise Architecture (EA) and SOA principles. Aeronautical Information Management (AIM) using ontologies, provides the benefit of fast ramp up of on-the-spot services, reduced development efforts and additional defined data as source for collaborative decision making within the System-Wide Information Management (SWIM). Such services deployed in NextGen and SESAR will optimize operations workflow, communication needs, and information sharing.","2155-4951","978-1-4577-0592-2","10.1109/ICNSURV.2011.5935286","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5935286","","Ontologies;Atmospheric modeling;OWL;Asynchronous transfer mode;Semantics;Software;Programming","","7","","38","IEEE","30 Jun 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recently, semantic web technologies, especially ontologies, have been proposed in order to increase the level of automation and reduce human intervention in different domains. Business process management has benefited from the emergence of these technologies and the concept of semantic business process management appeared to make the whole business process accessible to intelligent queries as for machine reasoning. Whereas most approaches focus on providing mechanisms for modeling and configuring process models, their validation was treated syntactically rather than semantically.

Aiming to facilitate, or even enable the modeling of complex domains, several techniques have been proposed in order to automatically generate ontologies from texts. However, none is able to generate well-founded ontologies (which are constructed based on Foundational Ontologies). Moreover, an important issue on learning from text is how to distinguish among different meanings of a word, which impacts on concepts expressed by the ontologies.

Machine learning-based protein function prediction is an effective approach to solve this problem. Most of the existing methods only use the protein sequence but ignore the three-dimensional structure which is closely related to the protein function. And the hierarchy of protein functions is not adequately considered. To solve this problem, we propose a graph neural network (GNNGO3D) that combines the three-dimensional structure and functional hierarchy learning. GNNGO3D simultaneously uses three kinds of information: protein sequence, tertiary structure, and hierarchical relationship of protein function to predict protein function. The novelty of GNNGO3D lies in that it integrates the learning of functional level information into the method of predicting protein function by using tertiary structure information, fully learning the relationship between protein functions, and helping to better predict protein function. Experimental results show that our method is superior to existing methods for predicting protein function based on sequence and structure.","1558-2191","","10.1109/TKDE.2023.3331005","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61976247); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:2682021ZTPY110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10313062","Graph neural networks;gene ontology;language model;machine learning;protein function prediction","Proteins;Feature extraction;Protein sequence;Three-dimensional displays;Task analysis;Ontologies;Convolutional neural networks","","8","","46","IEEE","8 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditionally, these processes are conducted informally, relying on the engineering judgment of developers, which may limit consistency and reduce the potential for automated assistance. To formalize these processes, we propose using an ontology-a structured conceptualization of terms and relations within a domain. This paper presents a function sub-ontology, part of an ongoing ontology development effort in association with the Advanced Concepts Office at Marshall Space Flight Center, aimed at modeling early stage space system concepts. The function sub-ontology defines types of functions, their interactions, and decomposition rules using the Ontological Modeling Language (OML). This structured approach supports automated reasoning, facilitating more consistent and traceable functional decomposition. The ontology's reasoning capabilities are demonstrated through several examples, showcasing its utility in space system concept development. These examples highlight how the ontology can help ensure consistency between functions, determine equivalence of functions, suggest functional decompositions, and recommend necessary system elements. While the ontology shows promise in enhancing functional analysis in aerospace systems, it is a work in progress. Future work will focus on refining the formal theory underpinning the ontology and further expanding its capabilities.","2996-2358","979-8-3503-5597-0","10.1109/AERO63441.2025.11068551","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11068551","","Translation;Observatories;Subject matter experts;Refining;Ontologies;Propulsion;Functional analysis;Cognition;Modeling;Aerospace engineering","","","","39","IEEE","14 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in some business domains, core concepts --such as Capability, Service, and Value-- represent constructs that have different (and often conflicting) definitions and interpretations among the literature. In this context, the bias of a language is the preference for a theory, i.e. a particular interpretation of a concept. Currently, there is no explicit way of assessing and communicating this bias, and thus it remains difficult to assess the appropriateness and accuracy of a language for a particular purpose. In this paper, we provide a method for visual comparison of this bias with regard to the Capability concept, comparing three theories and three modeling languages where this concept is pivotal.","2325-6362","978-1-5090-3045-3","10.1109/EDOC.2017.14","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8089860","nuance;enterprise modeling;model theory;semantics;ontology","Semantics;Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Pragmatics;Syntactics;Analytical models;Visualization","","","","44","IEEE","2 Nov 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, still today, in the very early engineering phases, engineering intentions either need to be entered already in a structured and controlled expert language or require a human expert’s manual efforts for translation from unstructured language into formalized representations, in order for thereon-based consistent further processing in the existing tools. This process is time-consuming, fuzzy, and error-prone due to potential misconceptions and ambiguities, even for domain experts. In this work, we therefore present our NL2IBE Tool, which makes use of modern Natural Language Processing in combination with Ontology Mining, and which, based on and controlled by an underlying ontology, allows for the deterministic transformation of natural language intentions into structured and consistent engineering artefacts.

Although a major challenge exists in providing the technical means for the interconnections between models through their supporting tools, there is also a need to make such platforms usable for non-technical users. In this paper, we propose the development and use of a Domain Specific Multi-Modeling Workflow Language to address complex Multi-Modeling activates for a domain of interest. The first step of our approach is domain identification including the characterization of modeling techniques used in the domain. Then, a Domain Specific Multi-Modeling Workflow Language is developed to allow for capturing Multi-Modeling activities in the form of workflows. These workflows define interoperations between models. In our approach we also propose the use of a Domain Specific Ontology to capture the semantic concepts of the domain and then to guide the workflow creation process. The approach is illustrated using a case study from the Drug Interdiction and Intelligence domain. JIATF-South, an agency well known for interagency cooperation and intelligence fusion, receives huge amounts of disparate data regarding drug smuggling activities. Analysis of such data using various modeling techniques is essential in identifying best Courses of Action (COAs). We apply our approach to this case study by showing how a Domain Specific Multi-Modeling Workflow Language is developed and then used to create workflows of model interoperations. Models of Social Networks, Timed Influence Nets, Organization Structures and Geospatial Data are utilized in this example.","","978-1-4673-3108-1","10.1109/SysCon.2013.6549884","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6549884","Multi-Modeling;Meta-Modeling;Workflows;Domain Specific Languages","Unified modeling language;Drugs;Analytical models;Data models;Semantics;Metamodeling;Ontologies","","","","13","IEEE","1 Jul 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, the unstructured nature of this content poses significant challenges for extracting semantically rich insights. This paper introduces a novel methodology for the automated construction of knowledge graphs (KGs) from social media discourse, specifically focusing on Twitter tweets. Our approach synergistically integrates large language models (LLMs), specifically a fine-tuned BERT model, with an ontology-driven framework. First, we define a detailed ontology of online communication concepts. The pre-trained BERT model is then fine-tuned using a multi-task learning approach on a curated dataset of anonymized and segmented Twitter discussions, thereby aligning its semantic representations with the predefined ontology. The fine-tuned LLM is leveraged for several critical tasks including entity and relation extraction, sentiment analysis, intention classification and the inference of contextual information and discussion styles. Furthermore, a mechanism is introduced to infer inter-user relationships and shared interests using graph neural networks (GNNs), analyzing patterns in interaction and language use. This multi-faceted extracted and inferred data is subsequently employed to build a knowledge graph, stored and queried via the Neo4j graph database management system. This study presents several contributions such as the integration of a ontology with an LLM method and the innovative user relationship and shared interest extraction using graph neural networks. The proposed methodology was rigorously evaluated using a real-world dataset of Twitter discussions, showcasing its ability to capture semantic content, and elucidate inter-user relationships effectively and revealing shared interests of the users involved. Furthermore, an ablation study is included which further demonstrates each of the method component contribution and demonstrates the importance of such integrations. Our findings highlight the potential for various downstream applications such as in community structure analysis and sentiment analysis to improve information management within online social networks.","2376-6506","979-8-3315-0887-6","10.1109/IWCMC65282.2025.11059459","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11059459","Knowledge Graph;Social Media Analysis;Large Language Models (LLMs);Ontology-Driven Methodology;BERT","Sentiment analysis;Ethics;Social networking (online);Scalability;Large language models;Blogs;Semantics;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Graph neural networks","","","","34","IEEE","2 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In recent years, focus has shifted to cover fields of study that relate to Sentiment Analysis (SA) to improve and ease the tasks of our daily lives. We Propose ArEmotive (Arabic Emotive), a fine-grained sentiment analysis system that is human-independent which can automatically grow its source of information allowing for more precision and a greater dataset each time it is used through ontology augmentation and classification. Our proposed architecture relies on multiple data sources running through certain pipelines to generate a central online repository utilized by any mobile system to access this info-base. This system is important because many researchers in the field of automated ontology alignment and ontology mapping achieved a semi-automated approach to map new ontologies out of old ones or to extend already existing ontologies with data from new ones. ArEmotive identifies fine-grained emotions in text based on a dynamic ontology enriched through ontology alignment, mapping and machine learning assisted classification, resulting in a structure that contributes in: a centralized dataset ever growing to fit the need of the users, a sustainable structure able to allocate new data sources without the need to modify the system, ability to generate appropriate information even with the absence of “parent” sources.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3300737","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10198434","Arabic NLP;fine-grained emotions;ontology augmentation","Ontologies;Task analysis;Social networking (online);Sentiment analysis;Bridges;Blogs;Soft sensors;Emotion recognition","","7","","48","CCBYNCND","1 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This methodology is based on Model-based Systems Engineering and produces models of the system as core assets. These models are used through the whole system life-cycle, from implementation or validation to operation and maintenance. On the application side, the ontological framework has been used to develop a metacontrol engineering technology for autonomous systems, the OM Engineering Process (OMEP), to improve their runtime adaptivity and resilience. OMEP has been applied to a mobile robot in the form of a metacontroller built on top of the robot's control architecture. It exploits a functional model of the robot (TOMASys Model) to reconfigure its control if required by the situation at runtime. The functional model is based on a metamodel about controller function and structure using concepts form the ontology.

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.","1946-0759","979-8-3503-7488-9","10.1109/ICMLA61862.2024.00258","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10903241","Artificial Intelligence;Retrieval Augmented Generation;Knowledge Graph;Natural Language Processing;Non-Negative Tensor Factorization;Topic Modeling;Agents","Tensors;Accuracy;Retrieval augmented generation;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Question answering (information retrieval);Vectors;Malware;Reliability;Tuning","","2","","53","IEEE","4 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For the crew to be more autonomous, some of the resources dedicated to anomaly response mechanisms must be transferred from the ground to the habitat. Simulation models replicating the behavior of the system are examples of such resources as they can inform decisions to select mitigation strategies. Multiple models are typically developed for a single spacecraft as many domains of expertise and stakeholders are involved. Enabling simulation onboard a habitat will therefore require integration efforts to provide system-wide capabilities. Specifically, model parameters are model components that must be regularly calibrated to accurately represent the system state during operation. Depending on the type of simulation, these can differ greatly in their nature, thereby making difficult the tasks of creating, reading, updating, and deleting parameters. There is no standard specifying how to represent simulation parameters in a multimodel setting. Model ontologies have been shown to support integration, but their representation of model parameters is usually limited, i.e., the required type of parameter attributes and their hierarchical relationships are unknown. For example, quantifying the uncertainties in parameter values is essential in deep space operations but it is unclear how such information should be formally represented. In this article, we propose a parameter ontology extending existing standards with attributes enabling probabilistic parameter identification. This article is validated by comparing related work with the responses of the proposed ontology to competency questions and by evaluating its consistency, conciseness, completeness, and expandability.","1557-9603","","10.1109/TAES.2024.3440967","National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Space Technology Research Institute; Habitats Optimized for Missions of Exploration(grant numbers:80NSSC19K1052); Carnegie Mellon University; Dean's Fellowship from the College of Engineering; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10632866","Autonomous system;calibration;knowledge base;ontology;parameter;simulation models;space habitat;vocabulary","Calibration;Task analysis;Unified modeling language;Space technology;Computational modeling;Buildings;Ontologies","","","","56","CCBY","9 Aug 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Therefore, using this knowledge base we aim at finding for selected positions in a business process suitable process fragments for recommendation to assist process variant modeling. To do so, we define a process fragment as a neighborhood context graph, which captures order constraints between tasks and their neighbors. Thus, we compute similarity between fragments to select the most similar ones for recommendation. As a proof of concept, we provide a tool that allows process designers to retrieve similar process fragments that can be used to design new process variants.

MBSE empowers the formalism of system architectures for supporting model-based requirement elicitation, specification, design, development, testing, fielding, etc. However, the modeling languages and techniques are heterogeneous, even within the same enterprise system, which leads to difficulties for data interoperability. The discrepancies among data structures and language syntaxes make information exchange among MBSE models more difficult, resulting in considerable information deviations when connecting data flows across the enterprise. Therefore, this article presents an ontology based upon graphs, objects, points, properties, roles, and relationships with extensions (GOPPRRE), providing metamodels that support the various MBSE formalisms across lifecycle stages. In particular, knowledge graph models are developed to support unified model representations to further implement ontological data integration based on GOPPRRE throughout the entire lifecycle. The applicability of the MBSE formalism is verified using quantitative and qualitative approaches. Moreover, the GOPPRRE ontologies are used to create the MBSE formalisms in a domain-specific modeling tool, MetaGraph, for evaluating its availability. The results demonstrate that the proposed ontology supports the formal structures and descriptive logic of the systems engineering lifecycle.","1937-9234","","10.1109/JSYST.2021.3106195","CN National Key Research and Development Plan(grant numbers:2020YFB1708100); European Union (EU) H2020(grant numbers:825030); QU4LITY Digital Reality in Zero Defect Manufacturing; InnoSwiss IMPULSE project on Digital Twins; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9534721","Formalism;interoperability;knowledge graph;model-based systems engineering;ontology","Modeling;Ontologies;Unified modeling language;Tools;Systems engineering and theory;Semantics;Data models","","40","","42","CCBY","9 Sep 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

But, it is impossible to integrate the dispersive FMEA knowledge in the manufacturing process because there is a lack of unified management criterion of FMEA knowledge. In order to satisfy the requirement to share, reuse, and maintain FMEA knowledge, the representation method of FMEA knowledge based on ontology is put forward in this study. The structure of FMEA knowledge ontology can be described via visual modeling tool- Unified Modeling Language.

By using smart devices, it has the potential to change everyone's daily life. With large sets of advanced sensors and actuators, it can create opportunities for commercial organizations to establish new business models. A fundamental barrier to automatic business process sensing is the lack of modeling concepts that explicitly express Internet elements as components of a business process model. Thus, there is a clear need to model these processes associated with IoT elements in a formal and unambiguous manner. However, in the context of business processes, there is a lack of formalized and explicit descriptions of IoT elements, which hinders their effective modeling and management. This article proposes a semantic formalization of the business process management perspective in an IoT environment by proposing Extended BPMNO for IoT and Domain Ontology. It uses standard semantic technologies to give a semantic representation that allows us to describe concepts relating to the IoT and the elements of an executable business process described in BPMN.","","979-8-3503-1111-2","10.1109/ICDATA58816.2023.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10296153","Business Process Management Notation (BPMN);IoT element;The IoT-aware BP;Ontology","Annotations;Semantics;Ontologies;Data models;Business process management;Internet of Things;Sustainable development","","","","22","IEEE","1 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

An analysis technique called Ontological Cards (Ontocard) is developed to identify ontologically relevant syntactic features from programs. The ontological card includes a set of syntactic and relational features describing the nature of program elements. A rule-based classifier system is implemented to classify programming abstractions into ontological categories. The approach is assessed with the help of two different Java-based applications.

As this task ""automatic recognition of semantic relations between pairs of words in text"" can be used in many NLP applications, its implementation are demanding and may include many potential methodologies. And as it includes semantic processing, the results produced still need enhancements and the outcome was always limited in terms of domain or coverage. In this research we developed a buffered system that handle the whole process of extracting causation relations in general domain ontologies. The main achievement of this work is the heavy analysis of statistical and semantic information of causation relation context to generate the learner. The system also builds relation resources that made it possible to learn from itself, were each time it runs the resources incremented with new relations information recording all the statistics of such relation, making its performance enhanced each time it runs. Also we present a novel approach of learning based on the best lexical patterns extracted, besides two new algorithms the CIA and PS that provide the final set of rules for mining causation to enrich ontologies.","","978-0-7695-4959-0","10.1109/ACSAT.2012.95","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6516320","lexical relations;mining causation relations;ontology learning","Semantics;Ontologies;Syntactics;Machine learning;Iterative algorithms;Feature extraction;Computer science;Text recognition;Psychology;Linguistics","","1","1","14","IEEE","16 May 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We propose a novel approach that leverages instruction tuning and advanced prompt strategies to enhance DST performance, without relying on any predefined ontologies. Our method enables Large Language Model (LLM) to infer dialogue states through carefully designed prompts and includes an anti-hallucination mechanism to ensure accurate tracking in diverse conversation contexts. Additionally, we employ a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) to model and predict subsequent user intent. Our approach achieved state-of-the-art with a JGA of 42.57% outperforming existing ontologyless DST models, and performed well in open-domain real-world conversations.

Semantic building block based languages (SBBL) aim to overcome those limitations by integrating domain semantics in the modeling language. However, this class of languages is only useful if they exhibit the same expressiveness as generic languages.

Service modeling gained importance based on the requirement to better understand, define and control the services as basic building blocks of the SOA based environments. This paper proposes a model driven approach on how the Business and IT alignment in the service life cycle can be supported by introducing knowledge technologies for service models. The model based approach is presented by first introducing the conceptual research challenges for integrated modeling methods, followed by the overview of the prototypic implementation of the service modeling platform and concludes with a demonstration in the HPC-based HLRS use case.","","978-0-7695-4459-5","10.1109/COMPSACW.2011.77","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6032275","Service Modeling;Service Life Cycle;Meta Models;Ontology Based Integration;Model Based Approach","Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Business;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Semantics;Service oriented architecture","","1","","35","IEEE","3 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Amidst the evolving trend in protein language model development, there is an observable shift towards employing large-scale multimodal and multitask models. However, the predominant reliance on empirical assessments using specific benchmark datasets for evaluating these models raises concerns about the comprehensiveness and efficiency of current evaluation methods. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel quantitative approach for estimating the performance of transferring multi-task pre-trained protein representations to downstream tasks. This transferability-based method is designed to quantify the similarities in latent space distributions between pre-trained features and those fine-tuned for downstream tasks. It encompasses a broad spectrum, covering multiple domains and a variety of heterogeneous tasks. To validate this method, we constructed a diverse set of protein-specific pre-training tasks. The resulting protein representations were then evaluated across several downstream biological tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate a robust correlation between the transferability scores obtained using our method and the actual transfer performance observed. This significant correlation highlights the potential of our method as a more comprehensive and efficient tool for evaluating protein representation learning.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3370680","National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2022YFA1008300); Strategic Priority Research Program of Chinese Academy of Sciences(grant numbers:XDB 38050100); Science, Technology and Innovation Commission of Shenzhen Municipality(grant numbers:JCYJ20220818101216035); Shenzhen Medical Research Funds(grant numbers:A2303032); Shenzhen Science and Technology Program(grant numbers:SGDX20201103095603009,JSGG20200225153023511); Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation of Guangdong Province(grant numbers:2022A1515110647); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U22A2041); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10452779","Transferability;protein representation learning;optimal transport","Task analysis;Proteins;Protein engineering;Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Biological information theory","Proteins;Computational Biology;Machine Learning;Humans;Databases, Protein;Algorithms","1","","32","IEEE","28 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The designers are using State Analysis as a methodology and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as a modeling and documentation language in this task. To effectively apply the State Analysis methodology in this context it became necessary to provide ontological definitions of the concepts and relations in State Analysis and greater flexibility through a mapping of State Analysis into a practical extension of SysML. The ontology provides the formal basis for verifying compliance with State Analysis semantics including architectural constraints. The SysML extension provides the practical basis for applying the State Analysis methodology with SysML tools.

For the purpose of reusability and efficiency, a novel methodology by integrating ontology and refinement is proposed to formally specify and analyze POSs in this paper. An ontology of POSs is developed as an intermediate model between informal descriptions of ARINC 653 and the formal specification in Event-B. A semiautomatic translation from the ontology and ARINC 653 into Event-B is implemented, which leads to a complete Event-B specification for ARINC 653 compliant POSs. During the formal analysis, six hidden errors in ARINC 653 have been discovered and fixed in the Event-B specification. We also validate the existence of these errors in two open-source POSs, i.e., XtratuM and POK.

Software artefacts used to define design patterns in a formal and machine processable fashion are represented by uniform resource identifiers (URIs). This yields a description that is open and extensible, and facilitates the sharing of design among software engineers.

NLP4ReF tackles several key challenges: a) distinguishing between functional and non-functional requirements, b) classification of requirements by their respective system classes, and c) generation of unanticipated requirements to enhance project success. NLP4ReF employs a common natural language toolkit (NLTK) package and the recently-trending Chat-GPT. We tested NLP4ReF on PROMISE_exp, a pre-existing dataset with 1000 software requirements, and PROMISE_IoT, an enhanced dataset with 2000 software and IoT requirements. We validated NLP4ReF on a genuine IoT project. NLP4ReF swiftly generated dozens of new requirements, verified by a team of systems engineers, of which over 70% were crucial for project success.

Its diverse primary applications include social media analysis on Facebook groups and YouTube learning videos related to the 2023 IEEE CIS Education Portal (EP) Subcommittee, as well as in the areas of Taiwanese/English language learning and dialogue experience with GAI image generation. To establish the knowledge and inference models for the QCI agent, we initially developed a Taiwanese/English learning and experience ontology, including a content attention ontology, and an image attention ontology. The QCI agent utilizes metrics such as the number of views, posts, and comments to predict the fuzzy number of reactions. In addition, the GAI image agent generates Taiwanese speech-based/English text-based images and evaluates the fuzzy similarity score between Taiwanese/English and the attention ontology together with the Sentence BERT (SBERT) agent. This Taiwanese/English fuzzy similarity score is further validated through human assessments, with these evaluations subsequently serving as an additional metric for comparative analysis of Human-Machine Interaction (HMI). Furthermore, the GAI image agent is designed to create images and Chinese/English texts from text/speech translated by the Meta AI Universal Speech Translator (UST) Taiwanese/English agent. A Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)-based machine learning mechanism is employed to train the QCI model for assessing learners' performance and predicting the performance of others. The National University of Tainan (NUTN) Taiwan-Large Language Model (NUTN.TW-LLM) agent has been further enhanced to support interactive learning experiences for HMI. An SBERT-based assessment agent is used to calculate fuzzy similarities between questions and answers in Taiwanese/English experiences and dialogues. Experimental results demonstrate the feasibility and efficacy of the proposed QCI model, equipped with QCI&AI-FML (Artificial Intelligence-Fuzzy Markup Language) and machine learning capabilities, for social media and language learning applications on HMI.

To do this, however, it is necessary to enhance the way in which the current generation of tools view metamodeling and support the representation of the multiple, ?ontological? classification levels that often exist in subject domains. State-of-the-art tools essentially allow users to describe the abstract and concrete syntaxes of a language in the form of metamodels and to make statements in that language in the form of models. These statements typically convey information in terms of types and instances in the domain (e.g., the classes and objects of UML), but not in terms of types of types (i.e., domain metaclasses), and types of types of types, and so on, across multiple classification levels. In essence, therefore, while they provide rich support for ?linguistic? metamodeling, the current generation of tools provides little if any built-in support for modeling ?ontological? classification across more than one type/instance level in the subject domain. In this paper, we describe a prototype implementation of a new kind of modeling infrastructure that, by providing built-in support for multiple ontological as well as linguistic classification levels, offers various advantages over existing language engineering approaches and tools. These include the ability to view a single model from the perspective of both a general-purpose and a domain-specific modeling language, the ability to define constraints across multiple ontological classification levels, and the ability to tie the rendering of model elements to ontological as well as linguistic types over multiple classification levels. After first outlining the key conceptual ingredients of this new infrastructure and presenting the main elements of our current realization, we show these benefits through two small examples.","1939-3520","","10.1109/TSE.2009.31","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4907005","Language engineering;metamodeling;multilevel modeling.","Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Metamodeling;Concrete;Design engineering;Software tools;Prototypes;DSL;Production facilities;Software engineering","","68","","37","IEEE","2 May 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Organisations seek to convert procedure documentation to machine-readable formats as their digital capabilities improve and regulatory requirements tighten. In this paper, we consider the opportunity for semantic quality assurance of digital procedures. We demonstrate a configurable and repeatable workflow containing three modules. The completeness module makes implicit information in procedures explicit using OpenAI’s Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model. The consistency module creates Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples that are aligned with, and checked against, the axioms of the open-source Ontology for Maintenance Procedure Documentation (OMPD). Finally, the correctness module performs closed-world checks on the RDF triples using the Shapes Constraints Language (SHACL). Each module can be used in isolation, or together, to realise an end-to-end semi-automated quality assurance workflow. Pre-processing of the raw maintenance procedure documents to extract entities (tools, materials and activities) and relations is achieved in a novel manner using prompt engineering with OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo model and few-shot learning. This end-to-end workflow enables organisations to perform quality assurance such as assessing the correct order for task sequences, and checking that all maintenance procedures have at least one maintenance task. We demonstrate this workflow on six procedures from the iFixit repository. The outputs of this workflow support maintenance technicians, planners and engineers by realising high-quality procedure documentation and automated procedure management update processes.

Inspired by how clinicians rely on their expertise when interacting with patients, we leverage relevant clinical knowledge to classify and explain depression-related data, reducing manual review time and engendering trust. We developed a method to enhance attention in contemporary transformer models and generate explanations for classifications that are understandable by mental health practitioners (MHPs) by incorporating external clinical knowledge.

With this resource, PSAT enhances the ability of models like GPT-3.5 to generate application-relevant explanations.

Google's Perspective API defines toxic comments as comments that are rude, offensive, and likely to make someone leave the conversation. In this paper, we have built a toxic words ontology, which is as per our knowledge, first Ontology built on toxic words. This Ontology consists of toxic words and their antonyms and synonyms in increasing order of their toxicity levels. Traversing this ontology, we can find the best-suited word with less toxicity and similar meaning. This is a dynamic ontology and new words can be added easily. Thus letting us convey messages in a civil manner. We propose to reduce toxicity in the most straightforward way. After studying several papers, we found out that the toxicity mainly occurs because of use of toxic words. We also observed that use of less toxic synonyms or no toxic synonyms has huge effects on toxicity score given by the Perspective API, and results section proves that.","","978-1-6654-5493-3","10.1109/MLCSS57186.2022.00052","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10076731","toxicity;ontology;similarity;antonyms;synonyms","Toxicology;Social networking (online);Oral communication;Machine learning;Ontologies;Regulation;Internet","","1","","30","IEEE","28 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This way, the need for extensive manual coding may be somewhat reduced, ensuring that conceptual integrity is maintained throughout development. A case study showcases how the proposed framework may speed up the design cycle, reduce coding errors, and enhance system extensibility. Using ontology-driven generation ensures consistency and interoperability, as each agent artefact follows the established domain semantics. This approach may be especially beneficial in complex, knowledge-intensive environments that require collaborative and distributed solutions.

In this work, we propose a simple but effective DST model based on BERT. In addition to its simplicity, our approach also has a number of other advantages: (a) the number of parameters does not grow with the ontology size (b) the model can operate in situations where the domain ontology may change dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that our BERT-based model outperforms previous methods by a large margin, achieving new state-of-the-art results on the standard WoZ 2.0 dataset 1. Finally, to make the model small and fast enough for resource-restricted systems, we apply the knowledge distillation method to compress our model.

Domain-specific languages are developed with consideration for domain experts, and therefore are meant to be domain-friendly. However, their effectiveness in domain-specific models, when developed for knowledge management applications, is often limited by their expressiveness and implementation. In this paper we discuss current domain modeling practices, specifically the use of OWL (Web Ontology Language) and SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) within the context of product development, and how they often do not consider their intended application. To address this, we (1) recommend a set of best practices to account for domain context while promoting application-specific domain modeling, (2) propose that a metamodel be used to incorporate these practices early on in domain modeling and review how similar information has been represented in the past, and (3) discuss what factors should be considered in the development of such a metamodel in the future.","","978-1-4577-1648-5","10.1109/ICSC.2011.59","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6061365","Product Knowledge Management;Ontology;Metamodels;Inferencing","Product development;Ontologies;Computational modeling;OWL;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge management;Syntactics","","1","","36","IEEE","27 Oct 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We argue that semantic technologies and in particular semantic models or ontologies is promising modelling paradigm for DTs. Semantic models allow to capture complex systems in an intuitive fashion, can be written in standardised ontology languages, and come with a wide range of off-the-shelf systems to design, maintain, query, and navigate semantic models. In this work we report our preliminary results on developing a system that would support semantic-based DTs.

Web services (WS) enable distributed access and discovery of internal, enterprise functions and services over the Web, in a secure controlled environment. Yet, high level modeling, design and querying techniques proves to be a challenging task for organizations that are hoping to utilize the SW paradigm for their industrial and WS applications. Conversely both, SW and WS paradigm can benefit, if some of the traditional database concepts, functionalities and models are made adoptable to the new SW/WS paradigm. To address one such issue, in this paper, we propose a view model for semantic Web that can be utilized in the new Web information system framework, the SW/WS.

Furthermore, the lack of training data prevents the straightforward application of learning-based tools used in indoor settings. To address these challenges, we propose two novel extensions. First, we develop methods to build a spatial ontology defining concepts and relations relevant for indoor and outdoor robot operation. In particular, we use a Large Language Model (LLM) to build such an ontology, thus largely reducing the amount of manual effort required. Second, we leverage the spatial ontology for 3D scene graph construction using Logic Tensor Networks (LTN) to add logical rules, or axioms (e.g., “a beach contains sand”), which provide additional supervisory signals at training time thus reducing the need for labelled data, providing better predictions, and even allowing predicting concepts unseen at training time.

"Question Answering over Knowledge Base with Variational Auto-Encoder","S. S. Japa; S.

Knowledge bases are multi-relational graphs consisting of entities and relations representing facts about the world. These facts follow a controlled vocabulary that drives the knowledge base, often called ontology. Entities are the graph nodes, while relations are the edges connecting the nodes. While knowledge base attention prolifer-ates, extracting information from these resources is challenging. One of the promising approaches is Question Answering systems. The Question Answering over Knowledge Base(KB-QA) system aims to provide a natural language interface to pose a query to the KB. QA systems use embeddings to map the posed Question to the facts stored in the knowledge bases. QA systems can be effectively improved using large transformer models. These transformer models are computationally expensive, which prevents their use in real-world applications. To solve this, we started our study with the use-case of Knowledge Base Question Answering systems. In KB-QA systems, representing the entities and relationships play a pivotal role in extracting the answer to the posed query. Traditional KB embedding techniques represent entities/relations as vectors, mapping them in different semantic spaces and ignoring the subtle cor-relation. A pre-training language model for encoding the KB facts will preserve the semantic and contextual correlation. While learning linguistic knowledge, these models also store relational knowledge in the training data. These Language Models are often trained on a massive corpus addressing the Out-Of- Vocabulary problem. In this paper, we incorporate a co-embedding model for knowledge base embedding, which learns low-dimensional representations of entities and relations in the same semantic space. We propose a Variational Auto-Encoder, an efficient transformer architecture that represents knowledge base representations as Gaussian distributions to address the issue of neglecting uncertainty. In addition, our method has high quality and interpretability advantages compared with previous methods. Our experimental results show the effectiveness and the superiority of the VAE approach for question-answering systems on knowledge bases over other well-known pre-trained embedding methods.","","978-1-6654-5963-1","10.1109/BigMM55396.2022.00012","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9999076","knowledge base question answering;Bert;Language Model;KBQA;Multi-Head Attention;VAE;Encoder;Transformers","Vocabulary;Uncertainty;Computational modeling;Knowledge based systems;Semantics;Training data;Transformers","","","","59","IEEE","29 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A gap could exist between user information needs and his/her defined context as the level of the user's expertise in the search domain is directly influencing the query richness. The information retrieval system (IRS) must be intelligent enough to identify information needs and respond effectively to meet the expected needs, regardless the level of user's expertise level. This process is difficult and it remains a major and open challenge in the domain of IR. IR models integrate many sources to achieve an effective retrieval system. Semantic IR is an environment in which semantic techniques were applied to sort the documents according to their degree of relevance to the query. The present work proposes a hybrid model to rank documents. The proposed model is based on a query likelihood language model and the semantic similarity between concepts to assess the relevance between query-document pairs. Concepts were extracted by projection on WordNet ontology then word sense disambiguation was conducted. A semantic index was built to validate the proposed model.

As most of the phenotypic information lies in clinical reports, the challenge is to build an IE pipeline to automatically recognize phenotype concepts from free-text notes. A new machine learning paradigm around large language models (LLM) has given rise of an increasing number of academic works on this topic lately, where sophisticated combinations of different technics have been employed to improve the phenotypes extraction accuracy.

At the same time, there is significant interest in using large-language models (LLMs) to improve key chip design tasks. This paper describes PyHDL-Eval, a new framework for evaluating LLMs on specification-to-RTL tasks in the context of Python-embedded domainspecific languages (DSLs). The framework includes 168 problems, Verilog reference solutions, Verilog test benches, Python test scripts, and workflow orchestration scripts. We use the framework to conduct a detailed case study comparing five LLMs (CodeGemma 7B, Llama3 8B/70B, GPT4, and GPT4 Turbo) targeting Verilog and five Python-embedded DSLs (PyMTL3, PyRTL, MyHDL, Migen, and Amaranth). Our results demonstrate the promise of in-context learning when applied to smaller models (e.g.,pass rate for CodeGemma 7B improves from 14.9% to 32.7% on Verilog) and Python-embedded DSLs (e.g., pass rate for LLama3 70B improves from 0.6% to 33.0% on PyMTL3). We find LLMs perform better when targeting Verilog as compared to Python-embedded DSLs (e.g., pass rate for GPT4 Turbo is 72.2% on Verilog and 29.8–62.0% on the Python-embedded DSLs) despite using a popular general-purpose host language. PyHDL-Eval will serve as a useful framework for future research at the intersection of Python-embedded DSLs and LLMs. CCS Concepts • Hardware → Hardware description languages and compilation; • Computing methodologies → Machine learning.","","979-8-3503-6356-2","10.1109/MLCAD62225.2024.10740201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10740201","hardware description languages;Python-embedded domain-specific languages;large language models","Productivity;Solid modeling;Machine learning;Hardware;DSL;Hardware design languages;Chip scale packaging","","1","","42","IEEE","6 Nov 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The problem is that a gap exists between the respective backgrounds of modeling experts and domain experts. MDE developers cannot show a model to the domain experts and simply ask them whether it is correct with respect to the requirements they had in mind. To facilitate their interaction and make such validation more systematic, we propose a methodology and a tool that derive a set of customizable questionnaires expressed in natural language from each model to be validated.

An information system distinguishes itself from other software as it is developed to facilitate the operation of an organization, hence it reflects its strategies, plans, organizations, processes, marketing etc. We believe that domain knowledge involved in information system development, which may include industry specific knowledge and generic enterprise management knowledge, can be organized and modeled in enterprise architecture. We propose a conceptual modeling method for the domain modeling of information system based on one of the most widely used enterprise architectures, the Zachman Framework. Our approach maps phases of domain engineering to Zachman Framework and develops a meta-model for Zachman Framework which is adapted and integrated from the Bunge-Wand-Weber ontology.

State-of-the-art transfer learning is incapable of handling such zero-shot learning (ZSL) when defect labels are absent in training datasets. The latest research on ZSL leverages natural language processing (NLP) based on large language models (LLM) and shows promise by supplementing information to generate labels. However, its performance is hampered by the supporting LLMs pre-trained on generic vocabulary that failed to characterize manufacturing defects accurately. This paper establishes a methodology to automatically extract multi-level attributes from literature to improve defect representation, thereby facilitating ZSL. The extracted attributes contribute to a hierarchical knowledge graph, called defect ontology, to characterize multiple aspects of manufacturing defects. The proposed algorithm takes the defect images and associated text from the literature as input and develops an unsupervised method to identify the hierarchical relationships among the tokenized information extracted from the input text-feature corpora. The hierarchical graph is refined to retain the most relevant information by a pruning algorithm based on a minimum path search. A walk algorithm, along with NLP, parsed the generated ontology to create embedding of defects to enable zero-shot attribute learning to identify defects. The proposed method advances the ZSL methodology by automatically creating a hierarchical knowledge representation from literature and images to replace generic vocabulary in LLM adopted by ZSL algorithms, thus improving defect representation. The case studies are among the earlier attempts to demonstrate the feasibility of using literature data from public sources to extract attributes automatically to identify defects in a real additive manufacturing process based on direct-ink-writing.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2025.3537463","Division of Civil, Mechanical and Manufacturing Innovation(grant numbers:1901109); Air Force Office of Scientific Research(grant numbers:FA9550-23-1-0739); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10858700","Zero-shot learning;defect identification;manufacturing automation;self-supervised learning","Manufacturing;Zero shot learning;Ontologies;Automation;Data mining;Vocabulary;Accuracy;Transfer learning;Certification;Process control","","1","","","IEEE","30 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Early Access Articles"

While working with first versions of these tools, it became obvious that an engineering framework reflecting all aspects of an engineering data object was required. In addition, data analytics and technologies used to check data consistency became increasingly relevant. As a consequence, semantically rich data models expressed by ontologies come into focus of forming the engineering framework baseline in conjunction with related technologies such as reasoning, error avoidance based on data analytics, and knowledge-driven engineering environments.","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088312","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088312","Model-based Systems Engineering;Digitalization;Industry 4.0;Ontology;Semantic Engineering Framework","Data models;Semantics;Ontologies;OWL;Unified modeling language","","7","","22","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Ideally, one models one's enterprise and, with a press on a button, the ERP software supporting the enterprise is generated. In this paper, we present a systematic evaluation of Enterprise Modelling approaches for their applicability to automatically generate ERP software supporting an enterprise. Inspired by the work of an ERP vendor, which, next to generating ERP software to support an enterprise, also wants to incorporate the common-sense of an enterprise in the ERP software, we also evaluate Enterprise Ontologies since current Enterprise Modelling languages lack semantics on the instance level. None of the existing approaches are tailored towards automated (ERP) software generation without the need for programming. However, the approaches possess valuable aspects which can aid in the ERP software generation process. Therefore, next to the evaluation, we present take-home points from the approaches, e.,g., reasoning capabilities to make common-sense suggestions when something is not possible.","2378-1971","978-1-5090-3231-0","10.1109/CBI.2016.40","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7780325","Enterprise Modelling;Enterprise Ontology;ERP Software Generation","Software;Business;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Semantics;Programming;Systematics","","5","","37","IEEE","12 Dec 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, we defined Degree of Association (DOA) to measure SA from a concept to its direct-related concept in domain ontology, and proposed a Language-Model-Based Method (LMBM) to compute DOA. Our idea comes from the intuition that the semantic relationship between two concepts implies certain semantic association of them. We took probabilistic model for computing DOA, and used Maximum Likelihood Estimation to estimate parameters. We tested the proposed method on two different domain ontologies, and applied it in experiments of semantic query expansion.

In this paper, we leverage on the ontologically well-founded semantics of the modeling language OntoUML to propose a novel approach for model abstraction in conceptual models. We provide a precise definition for a set of Graph-Rewriting rules that can automatically produce much-reduced versions of OntoUML models that concentrate the models' information content around the ontologically essential types in that domain, i.e., the so-called Kinds.

In this paper we present a framework for defining and analyzing configuration of an Apache server. We define the notion of ""configuration space"" of an Apache server as a set of possible values that can be assigned to configuration parameters. We then define the notion of an ""obstacle"" and ""forbidden region"" in the configuration space that should be avoided. We model configuration space using a logical framework based on OWL (Web ontology language). The obstacles and forbidden regions in the configuration space are modeled as constraints in the logical framework. These obstacles and forbidden regions are essentially ""anti-patterns"" that a typical installation should avoid.

Therefore, this limitation hinders their use in multilingual healthcare settings and in environments lacking robust NLP toolkits to facilitate preprocessing. Motivated by the need for a more generalizable and accurate approach, this paper investigates the impact of large language models (LLMs) in advancing alcohol consumption pattern extraction from clinical notes. By reducing the need for manual preprocessing and improving adaptability to multilingual clinical notes, this work aims to enable broader, more practical applications of NLP models in extracting alcohol consumption patterns from clinical notes. By fine-tuning multilingual language models along with additional data sources, EILEEN effectively analyzes unstructured electronic health records (EHR) without relying on traditional concept normalization or extensive text preprocessing resources. Furthermore, the multi-modal component of EILEEN enables it to integrate and leverage diverse types of alcohol-related information, such as various types and amounts of alcohol consumed by a patient, thereby improving its pattern extraction accuracy. Our experiments, conducted in two different medical institutions in Korea, demonstrate that EILEEN significantly outperforms existing NLP methods in accurately identifying clinically relevant alcohol consumption patterns. By providing accurate, detailed, and clinically useful alcohol consumption patterns from unstructured clinical notes, EILEEN empowers healthcare practitioners with actionable insights essential for informed clinical decision-making.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3538803","Kangbuk Samsung Hospital Research Fund(grant numbers:I24006); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10870246","Clinical informatics;alcohol information extraction;natural language processing;multimodal learning;multilingual transformers","Natural language processing;Multilingual;Accuracy;Data mining;Ontologies;Hospitals;Vectors;Unified modeling language;Transformers;Feature extraction","","1","","65","CCBYNCND","4 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Current Semantic Web Service research focuses on defining models and languages for the semantic markup of all relevant aspects of services, which are accessible through a Web service interface. The Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) is one of the most significant Semantic Web Service framework proposed to date. To support the standardization and tool support of WSMO, a formal semantics of the language is highly desirable. As there are a few variants of WSMO and it is still under development, the semantics of WSMO needs to be formally defined to facilitate easy reuse and future development. In this paper, we present a formal Object-Z semantics of WSMO. Different aspects of the language have been precisely defined within one unified framework.

In mission-critical environments, the same information needs to reach multiple destinations with minimum delay and loss. This calls for formal and systematic techniques that can capture requirements adequately and implement them accurately, thereby providing the desired level of quality of service (QoS) for multicast communications. This paper provides a formal model for the heterogeneous wireless network and proposes a formal language that can specify and implement requirements, policies, instructions and abstractions for multicast communication over such networks. The language, named Multicast Specification and Implementation Language (MSIL), is also presented as a communication and control language for multicast configuration management, transmission, routing and QoS. The syntax and semantics of MSIL are described and discussed in detail. The applicability of MSIL constructs in modeling requirements for multicast network management is analyzed and demonstrated.

However, the results with such semantic extension have been mixed, ranging from slight improvements to decreases in effectiveness, mostly likely due to the lack of a formal framework. Instead, we propose a novel method to address the semantic extension within the framework of language modeling. Our method extracts explicit topic signatures from documents and then statistically maps them into single- word features. The incorporation of semantic knowledge then reduces to the smoothing of unigram language models using semantic knowledge. The dragon toolkit reflects our method and its effectiveness is demonstrated by three tasks, text retrieval, text classification, and text clustering.","2375-0197","978-0-7695-3015-4","10.1109/ICTAI.2007.117","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4410380","","Large-scale systems;Data mining;Ontologies;Information retrieval;Smoothing methods;Text categorization;Artificial intelligence;Educational institutions;Information science;Unified modeling language","","26","3","25","IEEE","4 Jan 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, they are a “two-edged sword”. While they provide strong support for communication within communities, allowing experts to express themselves using concepts tailored to their exact needs, they are a poor vehicle for communication across communities because of their lack of common, transcending concepts. In contrast, General-Purpose Modeling Languages (GPMLs) have the opposite problem - they are poor at the former but good at the latter. The value of models in software engineering would therefore be significantly boosted if the advantages of DSMLs and GPMLs could be combined and models could be viewed in a domain-specific or general-purpose way depending on the needs of the user. In this paper we present an approach for achieving such a synergy based on the orthogonal classification architecture. In this architecture model elements have two classifiers: a linguistic one representing their “general-purpose” and an ontological one representing their “domain-specific” type. By associating visualization symbols with both classifiers it is possible to support two concrete syntaxes at the same time and allow the domain-specific and general-purpose notation to support each other - that is, to form a symbiotic relationship.","1558-1225","978-1-4673-1067-3","10.1109/ICSE.2012.6227102","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6227102","symbiotic domain-specific languages;orthogonal classification architecture;ontological classification;linguistic classification","Unified modeling language;Visualization;Syntactics;Concrete;Biological system modeling;Object oriented modeling;Pragmatics","","9","","9","IEEE","28 Jun 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Despite these challenges, ontology alignment remains crucial for seamlessly integrating disparate knowledge sources and facilitating effective data integration. In this paper, we tackle the limitations of current ontology alignment models by introducing a novel, lightweight, semi-supervised deep reinforcement learning model called Deep Reinforcement Adaptive Learning for Ontology Alignment (DRAL-OA). The DRAL-OA method incorporates both syntactic and structural information into the training phase. In addition, this approach is semi-supervised, utilizing a portion of the training data and automatically generating the rest, which reduces the need for human intervention. Moreover, DRAL-OA uses non-domain-specific language models to ensure broad applicability and reduce the need for extensive domain expertise. We evaluate our proposed approach using two datasets from the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative (OAEI).

To this end, we undertake a case study that scrutinizes reviews composed by two distinct and demographically diverse groups. Our analysis entails the extraction and examination of various statistical, grammatical, and sentimental features from these two groups. Subsequently, we leverage these features with machine learning (ML) classifiers to discern their potential in effectively differentiating between the groups. Our investigation unveils substantial disparities in certain linguistic attributes between the two groups. When integrated into ML classifiers, these attributes exhibit a marked efficacy in distinguishing the groups, yielding a macro F1 score of approximately 0.85. Furthermore, we conduct a comparative evaluation of these linguistic features with word n-gram-based lexical features in discerning demographically diverse review data. As expected, the n-gram lexical features, coupled with finetuned transformer-based models, show superior performance, attaining accuracies surpassing 95% and macro F1 scores exceeding 0.96. Our meticulous analysis and comprehensive evaluations substantiate the efficacy of linguistic and sentimental features in effectively discerning demographically diverse review data.

Software engineering teams demand modeling techniques at several abstraction levels to manage the complexity of software descriptions. Besides, software models are applied more and more for the specification of safety-critical systems. Hence software models take a hybrid role - as a matter of team communication and precise specification for refinement. Both aspects are considered in the research area of Model Driven Engineering (MDE). It provides methods to deal with formal specified meta-models of graphical (intuitive) modeling languages. Unfortunately the syntactical a semantically correct (consistent) integration of concurrently evolved models is poorly considered by the most MDE approaches. Especially the detection and analyzing of model merge conflicts can be automatized by using logical inference techniques. Therefore this paper proposes an approach based on description logics.","1530-1605","978-1-4244-9618-1","10.1109/HICSS.2011.126","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5718444","","Conferences;Complexity theory;Model driven engineering;Software engineering;Collaboration;Analytical models","","1","","21","IEEE","22 Feb 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

For instance, a conveyor system can be represented from various perspectives, such as 3D-CAD models that capture its geometric information and discrete-event simulation models that depict the system’s dynamic material flow performance. The growing demands for flexible reconfigurability and adaptability in intralogistics systems necessitate frequent updates to engineering models. However, these updates often result in potential model inconsistencies due to insufficient stakeholder communication. Detecting the impact of model changes and related inconsistencies is challenging in practice due to data heterogeneity and complex inter-model relations. To address these challenges, we propose an ontology-versioning approach that automates the identification of inconsistencies resulting from model changes. Our approach facilitates the integration of heterogeneous model data, enables database versioning, detects inconsistencies caused by model updates, and provides traceability for identified issues. The concept is evaluated utilizing models from a prototypical implementation on a lab-sized demonstrator. Note to Practitioners—In the industry, the current development of intralogistics systems often lacks automated synchronization of overlapping model information and consistent model interfaces, frequently leading to contradictions among the models. This has been identified as a significant source of errors in the design of both industrial and academic intralogistics systems, as revealed by a study involving intralogistics experts from different technical disciplines. Effectively managing model inconsistencies is crucial for project success, particularly when frequent model changes occur. A promising approach to tackle this issue is to systematically link model data from different disciplines, through which model inconsistencies caused by inadequate communication among engineers can be identified and prevented. However, in many cases, changes in different model versions and their resulting inconsistencies are not adequately considered. To address this issue, we propose a concept based on ontology versioning that allows for the generation, comparison, and analysis of different versions of an ontological model database. This concept automatically identifies model changes, assesses their impacts on other models, and provides information to assist engineers in problem-solving. The effectiveness of our approach is assessed through an evaluation of three representative change scenarios, simplified from real-world use cases. In future research, we plan to extend the approach to general production systems and incorporate industrial-scale models from the broad range of disciplines involved in the design process.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2024.3362599","German Research Foundation (DFG)(grant numbers:451550676); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10454094","Intralogistics;inconsistency management;model change management","Ontologies;Solid modeling;Unified modeling language;Modeling;Data models;Analytical models;Adaptation models","","","","35","CCBY","29 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a post processing module based on Natural Language Processing rules is proposed to detect and correct expected errors resulting from recognition system. We suggest a semantic-oriented approach which can correct semantic level errors as well as lexical errors, and is more accurate especially for domain-specific sign language recognition error detection and correction.

The proposed project will involve a setup of integrated image recognition techniques along with advanced natural language processing models that systematically convert the medical images into interpretable labels, which in turn generate the correct answers to clinical questions. The ILA framework will operate in three stages: image labelling, context generation, and answer synthesis. First, the system uses deep learning-based image segmentation and classification models to extract relevant features and assign diagnostic labels to medical images. These labels provide the basis for generating contextual understanding, which is crucial for the subsequent stage. In the context generation phase, the framework uses ontology-based reasoning in combination with language models to interpret the labelled data within the clinical context.

While this format can be easy for humans to interpret in simple cases, as table complexity increases, so does the difficulty in interpretability. To bridge this context gap, many data publishers provide a data dictionary to capture schema elements' meaning through text descriptions. Existing work compounds the need for data dictionaries to improve tabular interoperability, but few provide detailed requirements for data dictionary descriptions. This paper identifies and defines three common types of data dictionary descriptions in the biomedical domain. We then compare the effectiveness of each description type by normalizing data dictionary descriptions to a single type using large language models and measuring their performance using a semantic tabular interpretation algorithm. Our experiments show that intensional descriptions, which describe the general properties a column member should have, are most effective for tabular alignment and improve the reusability of data dictionaries.","2472-9671","979-8-3315-2426-5","10.1109/ICSC64641.2025.00035","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11036150","tabular data;data dictionary;semantic data dictionary;semantic annotation;large language model","Dictionaries;Reviews;Large language models;Semantics;Information sharing;Complexity theory;Compounds;Interoperability;Standards;Lenses","","","","57","IEEE","19 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, this can be difficult with today's modeling tools because the meta-models that define the languages, views and services they support are usually hardwired and thus not amenable to extension. In practice, therefore, various workarounds have to be used to extend a tool's underlying meta-model. Some of these are built into the implemented modeling standards (e.g. the UML profile, BPMN 2.0 and ArchiMate 2.0 extension mechanisms) while others have to be applied by complementary, external tools (e.g. model weaving). These techniques not only increase accidental complexity, they also reduce the ability of the modeling tool to ensure adherence to enterprise rules and constraints.

To extend new variants of an already modelled product via the approach of a product family the challenge is to merge the product models, so that the same and varying parts in the model are semantically correct identified and mapped to each other. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for sustainable development of product families using the Distributed Ontology Language (DOL), Functional Architectures for Systems (FAS), and Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The proposed approach integrates the idea of DOL to represent an ontology of sustainability criteria and to map them to the functional architecture of a product family. FAS is used to model the functional architecture of the product family, while the FAS ontology is used to formalize the functional architecture and provide a standardized vocabulary and set of rules for modelling the functional aspects of the product family. SysML is used to model the product family. The proposed method is demonstrated through a case study of developing a sustainable product family of vacuum cleaner robots. The results show that the proposed method can help to identify opportunities for reducing environ-mental impact and improving social responsibility in the product family design while ensuring that functional requirements and design constraints are met semantically correct.","2472-9647","979-8-3503-5880-3","10.1109/SysCon61195.2024.10553629","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10553629","sustainability;functional architectures for systems;Distributed Ontology Language;product family;SysML","Vocabulary;Biological system modeling;Ontologies;Systems Modeling Language;Product development;Product design;Sustainable development","","2","","22","IEEE","17 Jun 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The need of a semantic workflow representation language then emerged and was developed defining an OWLS extension able to support workflow description. The resulting OWL-WS (OWL for workflow and services) ontology allows us modelling concept like abstract and concrete services and workflows according to a semantic workflow model also enabling specification of higher-order workflows and semantic service grouping.

However, these systems face significant challenges, including overreliance on manual expert intervention, limited handling of heterogeneous textual data, etc. The Description-Detection Framework (DDF) addresses some of these limitations by leveraging PropaPhen (Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology), UMLS, and OpenStreetMaps to detect suspicious health-related cases using spatiotemporal and textual data. However, DDF is restricted to detection and lacks the ability to classify the detected observations into meaningful categories. To adress this limitation, we propose to enhance DDF by incorporating a clustering-based classification process. This enhancement employs BioSTransformers, a pretrained biomedical language model built on Sentence Transformers trained on PubMed data, to compute semantic similarity between observations. By capturing domain-specific semantic relationships, BioSTransformers enables clustering that integrates biological semantics with spatiotemporal context, outperforming traditional methods from the literature in observation classification. Our proposed approach reduces the dependency on manual expert effort, improves the system's ability to process heterogeneous data, and enhances the accuracy and contextual relevance of case classification. The results demonstrate the potential of this method to advance EBS systems, providing a scalable and automated solution to public health surveillance challenges.","2372-9198","979-8-3315-2610-8","10.1109/CBMS65348.2025.00135","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11058583","Public Health Surveillance;Biomedical Language Models;Spatiotemporal Reasoning;Description Detection Framework;Core Propagation Phenomenon Ontology","Biological system modeling;Computational modeling;Surveillance;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Ontologies;Transformers;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Public healthcare;Context modeling","","","","26","IEEE","4 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Following this pattern, we start with a language based on description logics and add the capability of expressing rules, then functions, and finally behavioral aspects.

As software user interfaces seemed to adapt continuously to requirements, the interaction techniques of physical user interfaces (e.g. desktop PC, Notebook, PDA) principally remained the same. Moreover, physical user interfaces have been disregarded when speaking about user interface design in general. It is therefore not surprising that the methodologies used for physical user interface design are rather non-formal. This makes it complicated to sufficiently incorporate e.g. tasks, interactions and preferences of the user during the design process. As a result, contemporary physical user interfaces such as PDA's, Smartphones and Notebooks are far from being adequate for supporting the user in his tasks the best possible way. This is especially true when considering the diversity of potential tasks and interactions of end users in industrial environments. Due to this fact, the authors of this paper are convinced that there exists a need for highly-specialised- and adaptive physical user interfaces. These new user interfaces can only turn out to be truly useful when appropriate methods are applied which are able to incorporate the specific context of the end user and of the environment during the entire design process. The authors of this paper invoke that model-based techniques have proven to be a well-established approach when it comes to designing useful software user interfaces. In analogy, it is argued that model-based techniques provide a promising approach when supporting the design of physical user interfaces such as wearable computing devices.","","978-3-8007-3017-9","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5760489","physical user interfaces;mobile- and wearable computing;industrial environments;model-based design techniques;reference models;partial models;ontologies","User interfaces;Adaptation model;Computational modeling;Context modeling;Wearable computers;Software;Context","","","","","","1 Jun 2011","","","VDE","VDE Conferences"

By grounding MBSE in materialist philosophy, we aim to analyze vagueness in current definitions of “system.” We analyze the current definitions by using semantic analysis of decomposing their reference classes and intensions. Where reference classes determine the set of objects that a theory refers to, and intensions are the logical decomposition of a statement as it is written. Our findings reveal that the vagueness in current systems engineering theories is mostly due to the inability to resolve the ontological status of information. That is, current definitions do not clearly state how information interacts in the material world. Moreover, we have found internal inconsistencies and contradictions in current foundational theories, particularly with regard to emergence, interactions, and properties in both real and conceptual systems. We conclude that current systems engineering theories are not suitable for scientific practice. Moreover, we argue that adopting a materialist stance provides a precise ontological basis for defining systems, thereby reducing inconsistencies and enhancing the rigor of MBSE theories.","2472-9647","979-8-3315-0818-0","10.1109/SysCon64521.2025.11014868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11014868","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Systems Engineering;Systems Theory;Ontology;Semantic Analysis","Industries;Philosophical considerations;Grounding;Semantics;Metamodeling;Ontologies;Systems engineering and theory;Mathematical models;Modeling;System analysis and design","","","","32","IEEE","30 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In computer science, ontologies are software artifacts containing the schematic structure for machine-readable knowledge, typically formed as a graph of subject-predicate-object triples, constrained through Description Logics. These resources and their relations are self-defining, i.e., some resource may be defined by considering all its stated relations. Resources are often attended with natural language annotations, that humans may read and interpret, such as labels and definitions. Many long-standing ontologies have useless lexical definitions that define resources cyclically, e.g., a FOAF: Person is simply defined as “A person”. In Aristotelian terms, the definition of a thing should be reducible, by using terms simpler than itself, such that every definition can be unpacked up to the most general thing, which can only be defined by stating examples and use cases.

Users frequently report bugs, request new features, or suggest enhancements. Mobile app vendors aim to maximize user satisfaction by addressing these continuous comments and requests as early as possible. Typically, they prioritize delivering the most promising features, extracted from user reviews, in early releases while deferring fewer promising ones to later stages. However, due to the massive volume of reviews, redundancy, and conflicts among them, manually extracting requirements is inefficient and often challenging, making requirement prioritization even more difficult. Therefore, automating this process is essential. This paper presents a conceptual framework for the requirements prioritization process's automation, continuity, and scalability. The proposed framework follows a hybrid approach that integrates multiple advanced techniques: generative artificial intelligence, active learning, ontologies, and optimization algorithms. Generative artificial intelligence enables the identification of important patterns and the automatic extraction of requirements and their properties, which aids in assessing properties to determine requirement priorities. The generative artificial intelligence framework integrates with an active learning system to improve annotation efficiency. Ontologies help comprehend relationships, properties, and dependencies among requirements, aligning them with domain-specific knowledge. Optimization methods playa crucial role in the requirements prioritization process by computing the weights of various properties to identify the most effective combination of requirements and determine the optimal order for implementation. Consequently, this research presents a smart theoretical framework for enhancing user-driven maintenance and development of mobile applications. Researchers are tackling several critical challenges that remain unresolved in the field, with future directions focusing on evaluating its applicability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.","","979-8-3503-5546-8","10.1109/ITIKD63574.2025.11004934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11004934","Software Requirements;App Reviews;Generative AI;Optimization;Mobile Applications;Smart Framework","Technological innovation;Reviews;Generative AI;Active learning;Ontologies;Feature extraction;Software;Mobile applications;Software measurement;Software development management","","","","24","IEEE","21 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A fairly new type of embedded system has emerged with the advent of partial reconfiguration, i.e. runtime reconfigurable systems. They are attracting interest in many different applications. Such a system is capable of reconfiguring itself at the hardware level and without the need to halt the application’s execution. While modeling and implementing these systems is far from a trivial task, there is currently a lack of systematic approaches to tackle this issue. In other words, there is no unanimously agreed upon modeling paradigm that can capture adaptive behaviors at the highest level of abstraction, especially when regarding the design entry, namely, the initial high-level application and platform models. Given this, our paper proposes two domain ontologies for application and virtual platform models used to derive a classification system and to provide a set of rules on how the different model elements are allowed to be composed together. The application behavior is captured through a formal model of computation which dictates the semantics of execution, concurrency, and synchronization. The main contribution of this paper is to combine suitable formal models of computation, a functional modeling language, and two domain ontologies to create a systematic design flow from an abstract executable application model into a virtual implementation model based on a runtime reconfigurable architecture (virtual platform model) using well-defined mapping rules. We demonstrate the applicability, generality, and potential of the proposed model element classification system and mapping rules by applying them to representative and complete examples: an encoder/decoder system and an avionics attitude estimation system. Both cases yield a virtual implementation model from an abstract application model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3129899","São Paulo Research Foundation (FAPESP) through the Regular Research(grant numbers:2019/27327-6); Project “Real-Time Electronics and Computers for Highly Computing Intensive Real-Time Systems” at Aeronautics Institute of Technology (ITA) (RTEC project involves ITA/Brazil, KTH Royal Institute of Technology/Sweden, LiU Linköping University/Sweden, and Saab AB/Sweden); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9623547","Embedded systems;runtime reconfiguration;models of computation (MoC);domain ontology;mapping rules","Computational modeling;Runtime;Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Embedded systems;Adaptation models;Hardware","","6","","45","CCBY","22 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It can be observed that service models widely used, hence in order to enable a holistic view on a service all models need to be integrated via a hyprid approach. This hyprid approach enables the use of different service models, for a different context with different tools but share common aspects of the service. Such a hyprid approach can be realised with meta models as a concept. The Open Model Initiative applies the same principles on models like the Open Source community does for software. This paper introduces the idea of the Open Models paradigm applied for service models, aims to motivate to openly share services models on this platform and introduces the sample of an IT-Socket for business and IT alignment that is currently developed in the EU-Project plugIT.","2166-1677","978-1-905824-21-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5756516","","Business;Data models;Semantics;Adaptation model;Web services;Ontologies","","","","69","","29 Apr 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Expansion of the queries based on semantic relation and phrase patterns is an effective approach to improve the retrieval. In this paper, a novel approach to queries expansion is presented. In the first step, keywords and phrases in a query are extracted, and the query is classified using Bayesian classifier. The classification defines the domain of user interest which serves as the context around the query. The phrase is then matched against fixed patterns which are automatically extracted from the set of domain documents and serve as context within the query. This is followed by expansion of the remaining keywords that are not in the phrases. This expansion is based on synonyms and hyponyms in the domain ontology, and is controlled by measuring information gain. Finally, the similarity between the expanded query and the document of the domain is computed by combining the weighted phrases and keywords. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach improves the precision and recall of information retrieval.","2161-9654","978-1-4244-2107-7","10.1109/WiCom.2008.2543","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4680732","","Data mining;Ontologies;Natural languages;Semantic Web;Internet;Search engines;Information retrieval;Bayesian methods;Pattern matching;Automatic control","","","1","10","IEEE","18 Nov 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Web Service Modelling Ontology (WSMO) has recently been proposed as an enabling framework for the total/partial automation of the tasks (e.g., discovery, selection, composition, mediation, execution, monitoring, etc.) involved in both intra- and inter-enterprise integration of Web Services. To support the standardization and tool support of WSMO, a formal semantics of the language is highly desirable. As there are a few variants of WSMO and it is still under development, the semantics of WSMO needs to be formally defined to facilitate easy reuse and future development. In this paper, we present a formal Object- Z semantics of WSMO. Different aspects of the language have been precisely defined within one unified framework. This model not only provides a formal unambiguous model which can be used to develop tools and facilitate future development, but as demonstrated in this paper, can be used to identify and eliminate errors presented in existing documentation.","","0-7695-2895-3","10.1109/ICECCS.2007.9","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4276304","","Semantic Web;Ontologies;Object oriented modeling;Web services;Automation;Natural languages;Mediation;Computerized monitoring;Sun;Standardization","","4","","21","IEEE","23 Jul 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper we describe a methodology for requirements specification that aims to alleviate the above issues and that produces models for functional requirements that can be automatically validated for completeness and consistency. This methodology is part of the Requirements Driven Design Automation framework (RDDA) that we develop for component-based system development. The RDDA framework uses an ontology-based language for semantic description of functional product requirements, UM- L/SysML structure diagrams, component constraints, and Quality of Service. The front end method for requirements specification is the SysML editor in Rhapsody. A requirements model in OWL is converted from SysML XMI representation. The specification is validated for completeness and consistency with a ruled-based system implemented in Prolog. With our methodology, omissions and several types of consistency errors present in the requirements specification are detected early on, before the design stage.","","978-1-4244-2149-7","10.1109/SYSTEMS.2008.4519001","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4519001","requirements specification;consistency validation;design automation","Component architectures;Ontologies;Unified modeling language;Quality of service;Costs;Computer architecture;OWL;Design automation;Software design;Product design","","9","","16","IEEE","14 May 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

We present OntoSCPrompt, a novel Large Language Model (LLM)-based KGQA approach with a two-stage architecture that separates semantic parsing from KG-dependent interactions. OntoSCPrompt first generates a SPARQL query structure (including SPARQL keywords such as SELECT, ASK, WHERE and placeholders for missing tokens) and then fills them with KG-specific information. To enhance the understanding of the underlying KG, we present an ontology-guided, hybrid prompt learning strategy that integrates KG ontology into the learning process of hybrid prompts (e.g., discrete and continuous vectors). We also present several task-specific decoding strategies to ensure the correctness and executability of generated SPARQL queries in both stages. Experimental results demonstrate that OntoSCPrompt performs as well as SOTA approaches without retraining on a number of KGQA datasets such as CWQ, WebQSP and LC-QuAD 1.0 in a resource-efficient manner and can generalize well to unseen domain-specific KGs like DBLP-QuAD and CoyPu KG 11Code: https://github.com/LongquanJiang/OntoSCPrompt.","2472-9671","979-8-3315-2426-5","10.1109/ICSC64641.2025.00010","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11036145","QA;KGQA;LLM;Generalization","Large language models;Semantics;Training data;Knowledge graphs;Ontologies;Predictive models;Question answering (information retrieval);Vectors;Decoding;Topology","","","","37","IEEE","19 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In order to facilitate the meta-modelling task, we propose an extensible meta-modelling assistant. While primarily focussed on helping in the creation of meta- models, it can also help in creating models. The assistant permits the provision of heterogeneous data description sources (like ontologies, RDF data, XML schemas, database schemas and meta-models), and enables their uniform querying. Different kinds of queries are supported, and improved through synonym search. Query results are prioritized through sense disambiguation, can be graphically visualized, and incorporated into the (meta-)model being built. The assistant has been realized within Eclipse, and its architecture has been designed to be independent of the meta-modelling technology used. As a proof- of-concept, we show its integration within DSL-tao, a pattern-based meta-modelling tool built by our group, and two other tools developed by third-parties. The usefulness of the system is illustrated with a running example in the process modelling domain.","2325-6362","978-1-4673-9885-5","10.1109/EDOC.2016.7579377","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7579377","","Unified modeling language;Biological system modeling;DSL;Data models;Ontologies;Resource description framework;Organizations","","12","","36","IEEE","29 Sep 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In the context of detecting twitter spams, different statistical and behavioral analysis approaches were proposed. However, these techniques suffer from many limitations due to: 1) ongoing changes to Twitter's streaming API which constrains access to a user's list of followers/followees; 2) spammer's creativity in building diverse messages; 3) use of embedded links and new accounts; and 4) need for analyzing different characteristics about users without their consent. To address the aforementioned challenges, we propose a novel ontology-based approach for spam detection over Twitter during events by analyzing the relationship between ham user tweets versus spams. Our approach relies solely on public tweet messages while performing the analysis and classification tasks. In this context, ontologies are derived and used to generate a dictionary that validates real tweet messages from random topics. Similarity ratio among the dictionary and tweets is used to reflect the legitimacy of the messages. Experiments conducted on real tweet data illustrate that message-to-message techniques achieved a low detection rate compared with our ontology-based approach which outperforms them by approximately 200%, in addition to promising scalability for large data analysis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2877685","Lebanese American University; Khalifa University; EU-Funded Project TOREADOR(grant numbers:H2020-688797); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8502923","Twitter;meta-data;spam detection;text based analysis;event spammers;ontology","Twitter;Ontologies;Electronic mail;Feature extraction;Uniform resource locators;Tagging;Analytical models","","19","","45","OAPA","23 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite massive research on requirements elicitation, the reality is that requirements are often painstakingly crafted manually, word by word. This manual process is not only time-consuming but also prone to issues such as the misuse of terminology. To address these challenges, we introduce ReqCompletion, an approach designed to recommend the next token in real-time for given prefix of requirements description. ReqCompletion comprises two primary components. First, we have devised and integrated a knowledge-injection module into GPT-2—which stands as the largest available GPT model that allows for fine-tuning on specialized downstream tasks. This injection imbues GPT-2 with richer domain-specific knowledge, thus improving the relevance of the suggested tokens. Additionally, we employ a pointer network to optimize the recommendation quality by utilizing completed requirements as contextual support. Empirical evaluations using two public datasets demonstrate that ReqCompletion surpasses all baselines in performance (Recall@7 gains up to 65.87% than the second-best model). Furthermore, the effectiveness of its two pivotal design elements has been substantiated through rigorous ablation studies.

The subsequent natural language (NL) question generation is conducted through crowdsourcing or other automated methods, such as rule-based paraphrasing or NL question templates. Although some of these datasets are of considerable size, their pitfall lies in their pattern-based generation approaches, which do not always generalize well to the vague and linguistically diverse questions asked by humans in real-world contexts.

Typically, each recipe contains various information such as a title, a list of ingredients, and descriptions of the cooking process through text and photos. The estimated cooking time is another valuable piece of information when selecting a recipe. However, it can be difficult to accurately describe cooking time because it depends on the cooking environment and conditions, such as heat level and quantity. Therefore, some recipes do not include cooking time information. In this study, we consider the prediction of cooking time in general cases from the list of ingredients and the textual description of the cooking process of each recipe by BERT, a natural language processing model. For this purpose, we propose an additional pre-training method that weights words related to cooking time from a cooking ontology. Our experimental results show that our methods outperform a fine-tuned BERT model with additional pre-training by a standard method.","2832-1324","979-8-3315-0534-9","10.1109/CANDARW64572.2024.00032","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10817901","Cooking recipes;BERT;domain-adaptive pre-training","Heating systems;Conferences;Computational modeling;Ontologies;Predictive models;Natural language processing;Standards","","","","20","IEEE","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Instead, data scientists recover information and expertise from colleagues or learn via trial and error. Hence, this paper presents a scalable platform, KGLiDS, that employs machine learning and knowledge graph technologies to abstract and capture the semantics of data science artifacts and their connections. Based on this information, KGLiDS enables various downstream applications, such as data discovery and pipeline automation. Our comprehensive evaluation covers use cases in data discovery, data cleaning, transformation, and AutoML.

Then classification model is estimated by a mixture model combined with this semantic smoothing method. Ontology-based document representation can deal with synonym and reduce the concept vector. The semantic smoothing method can partly solve the sparseness of data. Our method is evaluated on OHSUMED and genomic track collection, and proper results were attained.

This study introduces RDguru, a conversational intelligent agent leveraging the LangChain framework and powered by GPT-3.5-turbo. RDguru offers a comprehensive suite of functionalities, encompassing evidence-traceable knowledge Q&A and professional medical consultations for differential diagnosis (DDX), integrating authoritative knowledge sources and reliable tools. A novel multi-source fusion diagnostic model, rooted in deep Q-network, amalgamates three diagnostic recommendation strategies (GPT-4, PheLR, and phenotype matching) to enhance diagnostic recall during medical consultations. Through tailored tools and advanced algorithms for retrieval-augmented generation, RDguru excels in knowledge Q&A, automated phenotype annotation, and RD DDX. A multi-aspect Q&A analysis demonstrates RDguru outperforms ChatGPT in generating descriptions aligned with authoritative knowledge, quantified by ROUGE scores, GPT-4-based automatic rating, and RAGAs evaluation metrics. Testing on 238 published RD cases reveals that RDguru's top 5 multi-source fusion diagnoses recapture 63.87% of actual diagnoses, marking a 5.47% improvement over the state-of-the-art diagnostic method PheLR. Furthermore, RDguru's consultation strategy proves effective in eliciting diagnostically beneficial phenotypes and refining the prioritization of genuine diagnoses through multi-round phenotype-orient questioning.

The framework is defined within the Model-driven Architecture and adapted to the multi-layer approach of the architecture. The data layer represents real world products, the model layer includes models of those products, and the meta-model layer defines the product modeling language. The semantic-based product modeling language described in this paper is specialized from a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the semantics of their product models explicitly and logically in an engineering-friendly way. The interactions between these three layers are described to illustrate how each layer in the framework is used in a product engineering context.","2161-8089","978-1-4244-5449-5","10.1109/COASE.2010.5584462","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5584462","","Semantics;OWL;Object oriented modeling;Ontologies;Atmospheric modeling;Geometry;Syntactics","","2","","24","IEEE","21 Oct 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A unique aspect of the pre-project work was a strong emphasis and investment on the foundations of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE). As so often happens in this business, plans changed: NASA's budget and science priorities were released and together fundamentally changed the course of JEO. As a result, it returned to being a study task whose objective is to propose more affordable ways to accomplish the science. As part of this transition, the question arose as to whether it could continue to afford the investment in MBSE. In short, the MBSE infusion has survived and is providing clear value to the study effort. In the process, the need to remain relevant in the new environment has brought about a wave of innovation and progress. By leveraging the existing infrastructure and a modest additional investment, striking advances in the capture and analysis of designs using MBSE were achieved. The effort has reaffirmed the importance of architecting. It has successfully harnessed the synergistic relationship of architecting to system modeling. We have found that MBSE can provide greater agility than traditional methods. We have also found that a diverse `ecosystem' of modeling tools and languages (SysML, Mathematica, even Excel) is not only viable, but an important enabler of agility and adaptability. This paper will describe the successful application of MBSE in the dynamic environment of early mission formulation, the significant results produced and lessons learned in the process.","1095-323X","978-1-4577-0557-1","10.1109/AERO.2012.6187337","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6187337","","Adaptation models;Computer architecture;Analytical models;Ontologies;Unified modeling language","","17","","16","IEEE","19 Apr 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

These changes are caused by `change drivers', i.e., events occurring within an enterprise itself or within its environment. Many scholars argue that the use of conceptual modeling in general, and enterprise modeling in particular, may help achieve and sustain enterprise agility. This, however, requires enterprise modeling approaches not only to provide an integrated view on the enterprise action system and information system, but also to account for events indicating business-impacting situations and information on their impact on the enterprise. In addition, being agile requires the ability to acquire information from event sources (sensing), to process obtained information, and to support a decision-making process (response). In this paper, we argue that the fulfillment of those postulates demands the application of an alternative language paradigm, namely multilevel modeling.

We design a knowledge-graph based approach for data discovery, extraction, and integration in materials science.","","978-1-6654-3902-2","10.1109/BigData52589.2021.9671503","National Science Foundation; Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9671503","Knowledge Graph;Materials Discovery;Information Extraction;Ontology;Natural Language Processing","Materials science and technology;Vocabulary;Technological innovation;Semantics;Prototypes;Transforms;Big Data","","9","","35","IEEE","13 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a novel approach to the workflow field by taking the view-point of a data-centric workflow. The key features of the workflow activity diagram (WAD) system are its record and field level views of workflow connections. It makes use of existing standards for visualization and provides automation features using existing domain ontologies. To execute the workflow, the WAD system makes use of the existing business process execution language (BPEL). The visualization system can be used in both process and data-centric workflows, thus lending itself towards a standard for workflow visualization. WAD handles multiple levels of user experience by using a multi-level drill-down approach. The user can drill-down as far as they are comfortable and allow the system to automate the remaining levels. The WAD system comes with two methods to automate the record and field level connections. The first is based on domain knowledge from the domain ontologies and the second is based of previous user experiences collected by the system. By connecting processes on a record and field level the system is able to connect processes that do not use the same data format. That is, it provides ad-hoc data format conversions. This removes the need for static data format convertors and thus increases system flexibility.","2377-5408","978-0-7695-3599-9","10.1109/ASWEC.2009.26","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5076656","Data-centric workflow design;Scientific Workflow;Business Process Execution Language","Converters;Visualization;Australia;Ontologies;Software engineering;Computer science;Data engineering;Ecosystems;Automation;Joining processes","","1","","13","IEEE","19 Jun 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The availability and appropriateness of tool environments supporting the developer is a crucial factor for such productivity promises. The widespread use of MDSD on various domains means a special challenge for the development of MDSD environments. Tool users expect advanced tools customised for the very special domain they are working in. However, tool development and customisation is a complex and expensive task. To address these challenges we propose to apply the principles of software product line engineering (SPLE) for feature-based customisation of MDSD tool environments. This paper is an experience report for the development of a product-line of MDSD tool environments that employ ontology technology to advance MDSD.

Traditional approaches based on the self-description documents for services usually utilize service signatures. In Web service composition, service clustering can also be performed by the invocation relationship between services. Therefore, based on the successful development of several embedding techniques for words in several contexts, a novel deep learning-based service embedding using invocation sequences is devised for service clustering. Moreover, many microservices are being created because of the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), and edge, and fog computing. Following these developments, Web service composition based on these environments has emerged in abundance. More efficient lightweight approaches to analyze large numbers of services are necessary for service clustering. Consequently, a lightweight deep learning-based approach for the semantic clustering of service composition is presented to address these requirements. In this paper, we first propose the concept of service embedding to capture semantic information from invocation sequences. Second, we suggest using state-of-the-art neural language sequence models for service embedding and develop a corresponding lightweight Bidirectional Encoder Representations of Transformers (BERT)-based model. Next, combined with K-means clustering, the semantic clustering of service composition is evaluated. Finally, the experimental results show that the clustering process can be effectively performed by the lightweight BERT-based model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3069509","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9389549","Semantic service clustering;service embedding;composition;lightweight BERT","Web services;Semantics;Computational modeling;Feature extraction;Ontologies;Deep learning;Data mining","","9","","46","CCBY","29 Mar 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, we constructed the Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto) and proposed the Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework.

But this apparent increase in expressiveness is accompanied by an increase in language complexity. In practice many organizations choose to only use a subset of the available modeling constructs. Using a well established ontology-based theory of representation, we analyze how this voluntary restriction affects the expressiveness and complexity of the resulting modeling vocabulary. We compare our empirical findings with two notation sets of the popular language BPMN - the core and full set. Our findings indicate that users are willing to accept ambiguity among modeling constructs and that the full element set of BPMN adds little expressiveness at the expense of considerably decreased ontological clarity. The findings are a first step towards an understanding of an optimal cost-effectiveness ratio for process modeling languages both in theory and practice.","","978-0-7695-3338-4","10.1109/EDOCW.2007.30","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4566973","","Unified modeling language;Ontologies;Documentation;Technology management;Flowcharts;Petri nets;Vocabulary;Conferences;Automotive engineering;Companies","","16","","24","IEEE","16 Jul 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To extract the relevant terms, we leverage the flexibility and power of Weighted Finite State Transducers (WFSTs) in dynamic modeling of natural language processing tasks. In addition to the information conveyed through text, ELICA captures and processes non-linguistic information about the intention of speakers such as their confidence level, analytical tone, and emotions. The extracted information is made available to the analysts as a set of labeled snippets with highlighted relevant terms which can also be exported as an artifact of the Requirements Engineering (RE) process. The application and usefulness of ELICA are demonstrated through a case study.

This allows for reduced maintenance, shortens development time, and permits automated model updates, system model executions, and impact assessment. Part of model driven engineering, multi-modeling integrates models that abstract various aspects of the system, such as I/O, behavioral, and functional among others, at different levels of granularity and using various domain specific modeling languages. An important challenge is to understand the relationship between these models towards preserving multi-model consistency as changes in one model affect other models in the multi-model. This paper presents a multi-modeling architecture that captures model relationships at syntactic and semantic levels. We define a taxonomy of change effects that relies on a relationship correspondence meta-model to highlight and trace the impact of changes across various modeling environments. Following the correspondence meta-model and associated change effects, our prototype implementation ensures that multi-model consistency is met and notifies stakeholders of significant changes. Our case study of a submarine tracking system checks multi model consistency and highlights the impact of changes across system modeling tools that capture its functional and behavioral aspects among others.

One reason for this is that current extensions focus on only specific areas and so fail to provide adequate coverage of the cyber security domain. In this paper, we present our work considering an analysis of existing extensions and identify the security concepts used within each of them. We discuss how there is as yet no single extension which covers a comprehensive range of cyber security concepts. Consequently there is no adequate solution for accurately specifying cyber security requirements within BPMN.

Due to experimental limitations, large-scale identification of protein function remains a challenging task in cell biology. Here we propose DeepFusionGo, a novel protein function prediction method that adopts a graph representation learning approach (GraphSAGE) to extract features from heterogeneous data sources. First, we generate embeddings from protein sequences using the pre-trained protein language model and InterPro domains with scaling gradient. Then we integrate these two embeddings with adaptive feature weights to the PPI graph and use GraphSAGE to generate the representation vector. Finally, we build the classification model to predict protein function based on the concatenated feature vector. The experimental results show that DeepFusionGO outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, including sequence-based DeepGOPLUS, and PPI-based DeepGraphGO. DeepFusionGO also performs well in difficult protein function prediction. We demonstrate that selecting an appropriate protein features fusion method can improve the prediction performance, and using the PPI network and the protein representation vector obtained from the protein language model through the GraphSAGE algorithm is an effective way to mine potential functional clues.

These applications are built upon Virtual Environments (VEs) in which artificial agents act autonomously while interacting in realtime with users. Semantic modelling of a VR environment makes it possible the knowledge-driven access from the description of VEs that simplifies the development of VR applications. It eases the development of these types of applications. Semantic modelling should provide a consistent representation of the following aspects: 1) The simulated world, its structure and the behavior of its entities, 2) Interactions and tasks, that users and agents can perform in the environment, 3) Knowledge items, that autonomous agents can use for decision-making or for communication with users. This paper presents MASCARET, a model-based approach, for the design of semantic VR environments. This approach is based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML). In this approach, UML is used to provide a knowledge-driven access to the semantic contents of the VE and not for code generation, as in classical software development process. Interests of a UML-based approach are that its metamodel covers different views of the semantic modelling: ontology, structure, behaviors, interactions, activities. It is also an extensible language that can be specialized to provide formal operational semantics. We also present how MASCARET can be used to develop content-rich interactive applications that can be deployed over various VR platforms. Finally, we discuss the benefits of such a metamodel-based approach and show how the multi-layer semantic model can be used in different VR applications, in which adaptive behaviors of artificial agents acting within complex environments have to be simulated.","2328-7829","978-1-4673-1248-6","10.1109/SEARIS.2012.6231174","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6231174","virtual reality;semantic modeling;knowledge representation;modeling methodologies","Unified modeling language;Semantics;Solid modeling;Collaboration;Electronic mail;Virtual environments","","28","","25","IEEE","16 Jul 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The divers formats and organisation methods of these collections, ranging from traditional print media to digital archives and multimedia assets, can hinder researchers’ ability to easily access and retrieve relevant information. This paper introduces an ontology-driven knowledge base to address this issue by enabling the efficient access to knowledge in the application domain and enhancing the semantic search capabilities in the field of Digital Humanities. Our approach focuses on the development of an ontology-drive knowledge base for semantic search in academic libraries by the example of the library of the Folkwang University of Arts that captures the knowledge concepts present in the library’s archival collections. The resulting ontology framework provides a structured representation of domain knowledge, facilitating the integration of diverse data sources, including structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data from the application domain into a triple store knowledge base. By leveraging SPARQL queries generated from Large Language Model (LLM) prompts, we aim to facilitate more intuitive and effective knowledge retrieval. This approach allows users to express their information needs in a more natural and flexible way, leading to more accurate and relevant search results. We evaluate the proposed ontology-driven knowledge base in terms of its integrity, consistency, flexibility, relevance, and scalability. Our evaluation methodology includes a combination of verification and validation techniques, including automated reasoners and query results based on competence questions. Our findings demonstrate the potential of ontology engineering to enhance complex information retrieval in academic libraries. However, we also identify limitations related to processing speed for complex queries and the quality of search results. This research contributes to the field of computational archival science by providing a novel approach to semantic search in academic libraries. By enabling more precise and efficient access to knowledge, our ontology-driven knowledge base has the potential to enrich the academic and Digital Humanities landscape, empowering researchers to delve deeper into the vast resources available within these institutions.","2573-2978","979-8-3503-6248-0","10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825984","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10825984","knowledge engineering;ontology framework;digital humanities;knowledge base;semantic search","Knowledge engineering;Art;Semantic search;Soft sensors;Scalability;Knowledge based systems;Organizations;Ontologies;Media;Libraries","","1","","31","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
"Natural Language Processing as a Foundation of the Semantic Web","Y. Wilks; C. Brewster",NA; NA,Natural Language Processing as a Foundation of the Semantic Web,"","2009","","","","","Natural Language Processing as a Foundation of the Semantic Web argues that Natural Language Processing (NLP) does, and will continue to, underlie the Semantic Web (SW), including its initial construction from unstructured sources like the World Wide Web, in several different ways, and whether its advocates realise this or not. Chiefly, it argues, such NLP activity is the only way up to a defensible notion of meaning at conceptual levels based on lower level empirical computations over usage. The claim being made is definitely not logic-bad, NLP-good in any simple-minded way, but that the SW will be a fascinating interaction of these two methodologies, like the WWW (which, as the authors explain, has been a fruitful field for statistical NLP research) but with deeper content. Only NLP technologies (and chiefly information extraction) will be able to provide the requisite resource description framework (RDF) knowledge stores for the SW from existing WWW (unstructured) text databases, and in the vast quantities needed. There is no alternative at this point, since a wholly or mostly hand-crafted SW is also unthinkable, as is a SW built from scratch and without reference to the WWW. It is also assumed here that, whatever the limitations on current SW representational power drawn attention to here, the SW will continue to grow in a distributed manner so as to serve the needs of scientists, even if it is not perfect. The WWW has already shown how an imperfect artefact can become indispensable. Natural Language Processing as a Foundation of the Semantic Web will appeal to researchers, practitioners and anyone with an interest in NLP, the philosophy of language, cognitive science, the Semantic Web and Web Science generally, as well as providing a magisterial and controversial overview of the history of artificial intelligence","","9781601982117","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187064.pdf&bkn=8187064&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","15 Dec 2017","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Unlike previous video editing understanding benchmarks that focus mainly on editing element classification, VEU-Bench encompasses 19 fine-grained tasks across three stages: recognition, reasoning, and judging. To enhance the annotation of VEU automatically, we built an annotation pipeline integrated with an ontology-based knowledge base. Through extensive experiments with 11 state-of-the-art Vid-LLMs, our findings reveal that current Vid-LLMs face significant challenges in VEU tasks, with some performing worse than random choice. To alleviate this issue, we develop Oscars1, a VEU expert model fine-tuned on the curated VEU-Bench dataset. It outperforms existing open-source Vid-LLMs on VEU-Bench by over 28.3% in accuracy and achieves performance comparable to commercial models like GPT-4o.

Hence, with this information, the researchers could focus their attention on finding solutions to transform those models at CIM level that have not been transformed into models at PIM level. Likewise, this mapping study provides information regarding the technological support of this type of transformation.

Cyber-Physical Production System (CPPS) is one of the fundamental concepts of Industry 4.0 that aims to develop an intelligent manufacturing environment by leveraging concepts like the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud computing, virtualization, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, the challenges originating from the technological heterogeneity in the manufacturing domain remain primary obstacles towards realising a fully automated CPPS. Among them, semantic heterogeneity in manufacturing information is the most crucial which can be attributed to technology and vendor-specific information modelling mechanisms. A CPPS requires seamless machine-to-machine communication which could be hindered due to the non-interoperability among machine data on a semantic level. Therefore, the primary focus of this thesis work is to understand the semantic interoperability challenges of CPPS and propose solutions to address those challenges. The proposed solution revolves around the development of semantic domain models using the modelling philosophies of Domain-Driven Design (DDD).","","979-8-3503-2498-3","10.1109/MODELS-C59198.2023.00044","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10350790","CPPS;Domain-Driven Design (DDD);Information Model;Industry 4.0","Production systems;Machine-to-machine communications;Philosophical considerations;Semantics;Model driven engineering;Fourth Industrial Revolution;Internet of Things","","1","","59","IEEE","22 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Neurosymbolic approaches provide a promising alternative by enabling traceable, context-aware decision making. However, constructing enterprise-level multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs) that enable neurosymbolic approaches remains largely impractical. Although prior efforts have explored MMKG construction, they fall short in addressing the scalability, modularity, and integration that are necessary for any enterprise-grade application. We present a fully automated MMKG construction framework tailored to real-world enterprise environments. Our system features a modular, self-refining lifecycle with a support for human-in-the-loop feedback, enabling scalable, cost-effective, and task-aligned MMKG generation.

Existing RC methods can be classified into two categories: sequence-based methods and dependency-based methods. Sequence-based methods identify the target relation based on the overall semantics of the whole sentence, which will inevitably introduce noisy features. Dependency-based methods extract indicative word-level features from the Shortest Dependency Path (SDP) between given entities and attempt to establish a statistical association between the words and the target relations. This pattern relatively eliminates the influence of noisy features and achieves a robust performance on long sentences. Nevertheless, we observe that majority of relation classification processes involve complex semantic reasoning which is hard to be achieved based on the word-level statistical association. To solve this problem, we categorize all relations into atomic relations and composed-relations. The atomic relations are the basic relations that can be identified based on the word-level features, while the composed-relation requires to be deducted from multiple atomic relations. Correspondingly, we propose the Atomic Relation Encoding and Reasoning Model (ATERM). In the atomic relation encoding stage, ATERM groups the word-level features and encodes multiple atomic relations in parallel. In the atomic relation reasoning stage, ATERM establishes the atomic relation chain where relation-level features are extracted to identify composed-relations. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art results on the three most popular relation classification datasets – TACRED, TACRED-Revisit, and SemEval 2010 task 8 with significant improvements.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2023.3265205","Beijing Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:4222032); Foundation for Innovative Research Groups of the National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61921003); National Key R&D Program of China(grant numbers:2020AAA0105200); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10107403","Information extraction;graph convolution;shortest dependency path;semantic reasoning","Semantics;Knowledge based systems;Ontologies;Feature extraction;Cognition;Encoding;Natural language processing","","3","","48","IEEE","24 Apr 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Traditional vector-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models often fail to capture complex relationships and contextual nuances, limiting effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. We introduce Contextual Knowledge Graph Construction (CKGC), a novel approach enhancing vector-based RAG by dynamically building a knowledge graph that reflects inherent data structures and connections.CKGC leverages text chunking, large language models (LLMs), and ontology mapping. By segmenting text and using LLMs to identify key entities and relationships, CKGC constructs a contextualized knowledge graph enriching information representation. This bridges the gap between semantic similarity and deeper contextual understanding, enabling more accurate and nuanced retrieval.Experiments on 2,000 lease agreements demonstrate that CKGC significantly improves vector-based RAG in information retrieval and question answering tasks, with substantial gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Top-k Accuracy.

In this phase, engineers gather, analyze, and specify the requirements for a software system. Requirements playa crucial role in the SDLC as they establish the foundation for the entire system by defining the expected behaviors of the software system to be built. The resulting specifications are captured in a Software Requirement Specification (SRS) document. As part of the validation process, requirement specifications are traced. Requirement tracing involves linking the requirement to the artifacts where the customer requested the high-level requirement. Teaching proper requirements tracing can be challenging in a traditional classroom setting. It is essential to educate future software engineers on the proper process of developing an SRS document and of tracing requirements back to the originating artifact, which is also challenging due to the complexity and large scope of applying the complete requirements engineering process. Understanding how changes in customer needs can impact requirements is an imperative learning opportunity. In this work, we aim to incorporate the use of AI in the teaching of requirements tracing using Large Language Models. In this experiment, both GPT -3.5 and GPT -4 are provided the transcript of an interview between the customer and the engineering team, as well as the subsequent requirements elicited from that meeting and other customer provided artifacts. The GPTs are then instructed to determine which requirements can be traced back to the interview transcript. At the same time, the students (the requirements engineering team) conduct their own effort to trace requirements back to the original interview. The experiment was taken one step further to assess students' and the GPTs abilities to address requirements modifications. After another interview with the customer, where some needs were changed, some requirements were modified, and students, and GPTs were asked to trace the modified requirements to the new interview. The results proved that students are better than both GPT versions at tracing modified requirements, yet GPTs again identified requirements that students didn't trace back. The findings, illustrate that AI can help in the teaching of requirement tracing; these results suggest that while no AI model is currently capable of replacing real requirement engineers as they don't outperform students, it can be used as a tool to test the completeness of the requirement tracing process. We posit that GPT can be a tool for students to self-assess the degree to which their own requirements tracing is exhaustive.","2377-634X","979-8-3503-5150-7","10.1109/FIE61694.2024.10892858","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10892858","AI;Requirement Tracing;Education;Software Requirement Specification;Large Language Models","Training;Visualization;Atmospheric modeling;Prototypes;Software systems;Requirements engineering;Interviews;Artificial intelligence;Software engineering;Software development management","","","","50","IEEE","26 Feb 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, LLMs struggle with more complex aspects like recipe semantics and process comprehension. Furthermore, LLMs have limited ability to account for user preferences since they are based on statistical patterns. As a result, these recipes may be invalid. Evolutionary algorithms inspired by the process of natural selection are optimization algorithms that use stochastic operators to generate new solutions. These algorithms can generate large number of solutions from the set of possible solution space. Moreover, these algorithms have the capability to incorporate user preferences in fitness function to generate novel recipes that are more aligned with the fitness objective. In this paper, we propose the  $EvoRecipes$  framework to generate novel recipes. The  $EvoRecipes$  framework utilizes both Genetic Algorithm and generative AI in addition to  $RecipeOn$  ontology, and  $RecipeKG$  knowledge graph.

However, one of the main obstacles to their adoption lies in obtaining the formal specification of the system, and, in the case of refinement-based formal methods such as B System or Event-B, in obtaining the most abstract specification that heads the development of the system. The SysML/KAOS requirements engineering method is proposed to overcome this difficulty. It includes a goal modeling language to model requirements from stakeholders needs. Translation rules from a goal model to a B System specification have already been defined. They allow to obtain a skeleton of the system specification. To complete it, a language has been defined to express the domain model associated to the goal model. Its translation gives the structural part of the B System specification. However, it very often appears that new elements must be added in the B System specification obtained from SysML/KAOS models, discovered for instance when specifying the body of events and/or by using formal validation and/or verification tools. We have therefore defined a set of rules allowing the back propagation, within domain models, of every newly added element. This paper describes these rules and how they are specified in Event-B. Their consistency is proved using the Rodin tool. We show that they are structure preserving: two related elements within the B System specification remain related within the domain model. This is done by proving various isomorphisms between the B System specification and the domain models.","","978-1-5386-9341-4","10.1109/ICECCS2018.2018.00025","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8595070","Requirements Engineering;Domain Modeling;SysML/KAOS;Event-B;B System","Optimized production technology;Backpropagation;Actuators;Boilers;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Requirements engineering","","","","33","IEEE","30 Dec 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Standards such as modeling languages, frameworks, etc. have been developed by organizations to master this complexity. Although they are useful, almost mandatory, having them systematically as the entry point of modeling adds new complexity challenges causing additional costs in Systems Engineering activities. An automated objective-driven approach named Modeling Planning Process (MPP) that drives the usage of such standards has been proposed to master the modeling activities. Its application in actual projects to tailor the modeling effort, clearly demonstrated its relevance. The result is that tailoring modeling is mandatory, thus modeling choices (framework, models, etc.) are based and assessed against previously defined modeling objectives (MOs). This paper firstly summarizes the MPP approach we extended and automated recently; a five-step approach based on MOs as entry points that drive modeling activities. Secondly, the effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through a case study that exposes two simple MOs and the conceptual data model to support them. This experience shows that the modeling effort should be tailored according to two perspectives: what must be modeled, and how far this modeling must be performed. Finally, the paper presents the induced necessity for a formal approach to federate models.","","978-1-4799-5927-3","10.1109/SYSCON.2015.7116803","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7116803","systems of systems;systems engineering;model-based systems engineering;architecture framework;domain specific language;ontology;model federation","Standards;Unified modeling language;Data models;Planning;Ontologies","","5","","14","IEEE","4 Jun 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This allows them to create a mental map of the environment, allowing them to navigate on-demand when given linguistic instructions. A natural goal in Vision Language Navigation (VLN) research is to impart autonomous agents with similar capabilities. Recent works take a step towards this goal by creating a semantic spatial map representation of the environment without any labeled data. However, their representations are limited for practical applicability as they do not distinguish between different instances of the same object. In this work, we address this limitation by integrating instance-level information into spatial map representation using a community detection algorithm and utilizing word ontology learned by large language models (LLMs) to perform open-set semantic associations in the mapping representation. The resulting map representation improves the navigation performance by two-fold (233%) on realistic language commands with instance-specific descriptions compared to the baseline.

However, the identity-based access control in the OGSA-DAI causes substantial overhead for the resource providers in virtual organizations (VOs), because the access control information of individual users has to be maintained by each resource provider. In addition, access control policies need to be specified and managed across multiple VOs. To solve these problems, we propose the use of semantic-based access control policies in data grids. We use the Web ontology language (OWL) standard to represent the ontology of an organization's resources and users. Recently, eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) has been increasingly used for the representation of access control policies in grid environments.

Over the years, there has been often held the hypothesis that pattern-based methods should perform better than term-based ones in describing user preferences; yet, how to effectively use large scale patterns remains a hard problem in text mining. To make a breakthrough in this challenging issue, this paper presents an innovative model for relevance feature discovery. It discovers both positive and negative patterns in text documents as higher level features and deploys them over low-level features (terms).

This new computing paradigm offers numerous advantages but also, poses significant challenges. Advantages are related to the flexibility service providers have on deploying virtual resources on as-needed-basis, providing thus opportunities for large scale computing capabilities, while limiting the total cost of ownership. However, these benefits come at the cost of the user partially losing control over the deployed resources and the cost managing platforms and applications that are now provisioned at an unprecedented rate and interaction complexity. In order to address the above challenges, a service management and service assurance framework is required, whereby policies should be formally modeled, and consequently be verified against runtime system behavior models. In this paper, we survey a number of policy modeling and policy compliance verification techniques and we propose a corresponding basic taxonomy for these.","2326-6937","978-1-4673-3001-5","10.1109/MESOCA.2012.6392600","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6392600","Software Engineering;Service Oriented Systems;Policy Modeling;Compliance Analysis","Unified modeling language;Business;Software systems;Visualization;Semantics;Security;Maintenance engineering","","1","","49","IEEE","24 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In contrast to traditional named entity typing, the number of potential labels is in the thousands and one mention can have more than one assigned type. Previous approaches either depend on large training datasets, or require inefficient encoding of all input-type combinations. Therefore, there is a need for investigating the efficiency during training and prediction of entity typing models in the ultrafine-grained setting, considering its distinctively bigger search space, compared to the coarse- and fine-grained tasks. To efficiently solve UFET, we propose Decent, a lightweight model that encodes, using a pretrained language model, the input sentences separately from the type labels. Additionally, we make use of negative oversampling to speed up the training while improving the generalization of unseen types. Using an openly available UFET dataset, we evaluated the classification and runtime performance of Decent and observed that training and prediction runtime is orders of magnitude faster than the current state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a competitive classification performance.","2575-8152","979-8-3503-9931-8","10.1109/JCDL57899.2023.00038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10266269","ultrafine enity typing;named entity recognition","Training;Vocabulary;Runtime;Limiting;Computational modeling;Semantics;Predictive models","","","","32","IEEE","3 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To address these challenges, it is essential to establish robust cybersecurity measures that meet and exceed existing industry standards. In this paper, we describe a comprehensive strategy to bolster the cybersecurity of IBRs through cutting-edge applications and technologies via a cybersecurity framework called “CIBR-Fort”, a knowledge-driven, interoperable, scalable, and manageable framework for modeling, analysis, and mitigation of cyber threats disrupting different components of IBR systems. Our knowledge-driven analysis consists of a fusion of knowledge graphs (KGs) in cybersecurity and the electric grid, achieved through link prediction leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and cosine similarity, attributed towards informed decision-making for threat mitigation. The evaluation results show how we can automate LLM-driven link prediction based on the fusion of two distantly separated ontologies, generating a dataset that can be used for scaling via graph learning that can be utilized for further security analyses of IBR systems. In addition, we show our knowledge-driven threat analysis can predict different attacks with 91.88% maximum accuracy.

The experimental results show that (1) ontology-based term re-weighting provides the best results among the three query expansion strategies, (2) expanding the initial query with more precise ontology-based term enhances LSI based local analysis substantially, and (3) including context to term re-weighting and LSI further improves the precision.

However, ontologies of this size make it extremely challenging for such SMEs to understand and further tune these ontologies. Prior studies have proposed techniques for concept ranking based solely on the analysis of the structure of the ontology graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, which further exploits a word-level summarization technique applied to the source documents used to generate the ontology. Using the document summarization technique, we devise features that measure concept importance based on source documents where concepts are extracted.

This method consists of three phases: Similarity identification, Computation of frequent-access pattern and Weighted score computation. In the similarity identification phase, the location and page similarity is identified by computing similarity among the locations and retrieval pages. In the computation of frequent-access pattern, find all the frequent-retrieval of the web pages by computing the support value. The Pattern consists of Query, Location of the user and retrieved pages. Weighted score computation phase computes the weighted score for the patterns and rank the results based on the highest score.

This paper proposes an approach for modeling the context of collaborative cyber-physical systems and generating ontologies that they can use at runtime to communicate with each other and perform context-related reasoning. To account for the broad domain scope of such systems and unforeseeable future applications, the approach is not limited to a static set of prescribed ontological concepts.

Following initial word-level embedding methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and topic-based bag-of-words approaches like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), the focus has turned to language models and text encoders implemented as neural networks - ranging from word-level models to those embedding whole documents. The distinctive feature of these models is their ability to infer semantic spaces at all levels based purely on data, with no need for complexities such as syntactic analysis or ontology building. Many of these models are available pre-trained on enormous amounts of data, providing downstream applications with general-purpose semantic spaces. In particular, embedding models at the sentence level or higher are most useful in applications because the meaning of text only becomes clear at that level. Most text embedding methods produce text embeddings in high-dimensional spaces, with a dimensionality ranging from a few hundred to thousands. However, it is often useful to visualize semantic spaces in very low dimension, which requires the use of dimensionality reduction methods. It is not clear what language models and what method of dimensionality reduction would work well in these cases. In this paper, we compare four text embedding methods in combination with three methods of dimensionality reduction to map three related real-world datasets comprising textual descriptions of items in a particular domain (sports) to a 2-dimensional semantic visualization space.

The solution has been applied on a medical text segmentation use-case where the Bio-ClinicalBERT model is fine-tuned to segment discharge summaries of the MIMIC-III dataset. The performance of TocBERT has been evaluated on a human-labeled ground truth corpus of 250 notes.

Özcan",NA; NA; NA; NA,Natural Language Interfaces to Data,"","2022","","","","","Natural language interfaces provide an easy way to query and interact with data and enable non-technical users to investigate data sets without the need to know a query language. Recent advances in natural language understanding and processing have resulted in a renewed interest in natural language interfaces to data. The main challenges in natural language querying are identifying the entities involved in the user utterance, connecting the different entities in a meaningful way over the underlying data source to interpret user intents, and generating a structured query. There are two main approaches in the literature for interpreting a user’s natural language query. The first are rule-based systems that make use of semantic indices, ontologies, and knowledge graphs to identify the entities in the query, understand the intended relationships between those entities, and utilize grammars to generate the target queries. Second are hybrid approaches that utilize both rule-based techniques as well as deep learning models. Conversational interfaces are the next natural step to one-shot natural language querying by exploiting query context between multiple turns of conversation for disambiguation. In this monograph, the authors review the rule-based and hybrid technologies that are used in natural language interfaces and survey the different approaches to natural language querying. They also describe conversational interfaces for data analytics and discuss several benchmarks used for natural language querying research and evaluation. The monograph concludes with discussion on challenges that need to be addressed before these systems can be widely adopted.","","9781638280293","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=9785669.pdf&bkn=9785669&pdfType=book","","","","","","","","31 May 2022","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Natural Language Processing (NLP) can give us labels, the correlation of labels, and the ontological knowledge about them, so we can automate the acquisition of contextual knowledge. In this paper we show how to use tools from NLP in conjunction with Vision to improve visual recognition. There are two major approaches: First, different language databases organize words according to various semantic concepts. Using these, we can build special purpose databases that can predict the labels involved given a certain context. Here we build a knowledge base for the purpose of describing common daily activities.

"Emotions, language, and Sapir-Whorf hypothesis","L. I.

The paper discusses mechanisms of evolution of language from primordial undifferentiated animal cries to contemporary conceptual contents, while emotional contents are diminished. The paper suggests neural brain mechanisms involved in these processes. Experimental evidence and theoretical arguments are discussed, including mathematical approaches to cognition and language, including modeling fields theory, the knowledge instinct, and the dual model connecting language and cognition. Mathematical results are related to cognitive science, linguistics, and psychology. The paper gives an initial mathematical formulation and mean-field equations for the hierarchical dynamics. The knowledge instinct operating in the mind heterarchy leads to mechanisms of differentiation and synthesis determining ontological development and cultural evolution. Emotional contents of language are related to language grammar. The conclusion is an emotional version of Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Cultural advantages of ldquoconceptualrdquo pragmatic cultures, in which emotionality of language is diminished and differentiation overtakes synthesis resulting in fast evolution at the price of self doubts and internal crises, are compared to those of traditional cultures where differentiation lags behind synthesis, resulting in cultural stability at the price of stagnation. Unsolved problems and future theoretical and experimental directions are discussed.","2161-4407","978-1-4244-3548-7","10.1109/IJCNN.2009.5178891","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5178891","","Cultural differences;Cognition;Mathematical model;Animals;Joining processes;Cognitive science;Psychology;Equations;Ontologies;Stability","","","","43","IEEE","31 Jul 2009","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Expanding requirements is one of the techniques involved in finding information. In the search engine environment, the query extension includes the evaluation of the value of the construction and the extension of search queries to match new documents. In natural language processing (NLP), word embedding is a term used in textbook parsing, usually as a real-valued vector that encodes the meaning of adjacent words in the vector. It is assumed that the space will be analogous in meaning. Word embedding can be achieved using a set of language models and point literacy methods where vocabulary words or expressions are mapped to vectors of real numbers. For query expansion, one method used is natural language processing through word embedding. Other approaches are ontology, machine learning, and deep learning for automatic query expansion. This paper proposes a hybrid approach for query expansion by combining NLP and ontology through word embedding.","","979-8-3503-0541-8","10.1109/SmartTechCon57526.2023.10391425","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10391425","Query expansion;word embedding;natural language processing;Data mining;information retrieval","Deep learning;Vocabulary;Art;Ontologies;Search engines;Natural language processing;Data mining","","1","","24","IEEE","19 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Services can be encapsulated as a Function Block (FB) according to IEC-61499 standard bridging the gap between shop-floors and Information Technology (IT) distributed systems. This approach eases the task to describe the overall system in a single descriptive language. However, along with all these concepts comes the critical task of ensuring trustful communication between distributed modular functions to transform the atomic functionality into processes. One of the main challenges for function composition is the need to establish the interactions between the compatible modules to compose a process. This encourages the use of a rich descriptive language as a control strategy to manage the exchange of messages and to define the connections among the services. Primarily, this paper provides a contrast for Function Block composition using IEC-61499 and Choreography Description Languages (CDL) for Function Block based integration.

However, existing network-based methods focus on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, while the proteins without interactions are ignored. To address this limitation, we propose a novel deep learning framework for protein function prediction, named PFP-GMB, which incorporates multi-type biological knowledge to consider the proteins not present in the PPI networks. PFP-GMB leverages a pre-trained protein language model to extract sequence representations. Moreover, PPIs and orthology relationships are used to generate functional related features via graph neural networks and attention mechanisms. Finally, these multi-type features are fused for protein function prediction. Compared to eight state-of-the-art methods, PFP-GMB outperforms all of them in terms of F-max and AUPR. The ablation studies further confirm the relevance and significance of the multi-type biological knowledge incorporated into PFP-GMB for protein function prediction.","2156-1133","979-8-3503-3748-8","10.1109/BIBM58861.2023.10385760","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10385760","protein function;orthology network;PPI network;protein sequence;graph neural network","Proteins;Knowledge engineering;Protein engineering;Medical treatment;Feature extraction;Graph neural networks;Diseases","","4","","27","IEEE","18 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, identifying alcohol-related information from unstructured free-text clinical notes is often challenging. Not only are the formats of the notes inconsistent, but they also include a massive amount of non-alcohol-related information. Furthermore, for medical institutions outside of English-speaking countries, these clinical notes contain both a mixture of English and local languages, inducing additional difficulty in the extraction. Thanks to the increasing availability of electronic medical record (EMR), several previous works explored the idea of using natural language processing (NLP) to train machine learning models that automatically identify alcohol-related information from unstructured clinical notes. However, all these previous works are limited to English clinical notes, thereby able to leverage various large-scale external ontologies during the text preprocessing. Furthermore, they rely on simple NLP techniques such as the bag-of-words models that suffer from high dimensionality and out-of-vocabulary issues. Addressing these issues, we adopt fine-tuning multilingual transformers. By leveraging their linguistically rich contextual information learned during their pre-training, we are able to extract alcohol-related information from unstructured clinical notes without preprocessing the clinical notes on any external ontologies. Furthermore, our work is the first to explore the use of transformers in bilingual clinical notes to extract alcohol-related information.

In this paper we introduce CacheLoader, a new, design-independent cache-preloading technology. The tool's architecture follows the principles of ontology-based software to achieve complete separation between the cache-preloading engine and design dependent knowledge. Constraint satisfaction techniques are used to generate valid, interesting system initialization, and to satisfy explicit user directives. CacheLoader is currently being used by verification teams of several large scale designs in IBM. Results show that this technique provides superior coverage and user controllability, speeds up the construction of mature verification environments, simplifies maintenance, encourages encapsulation of domain knowledge, and enables reuse across verification environments and cache hierarchy designs.","1552-6674","978-1-4244-7806-4","10.1109/HLDVT.2010.5496651","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5496651","","Ontologies;Memory management;Access protocols;Computer architecture;Software tools;Engines;Controllability;Encapsulation;Control systems;Gas insulated transmission lines","","1","","21","IEEE","28 Jun 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Gas turbine-based power plants offer flexible operation that is being improved with new technology advancements. Those plants provide, in general, quick start together with significant ramping capability, which can be exploited to balance IERs. Consequently, to understand the potential source of flexibility, better models for gas turbines are required for power system studies and analysis. In this paper, both the required semantic information and physical behavior models of such multi-domain systems are considered. First, UML class diagrams and RDF schemas based on the common information model standards are used to describe the semantic information of the electrical power grid. An extension that exploits the ISO 15926 standard is proposed herein to derive the multi-domain semantics required by integrated electrical power grid with detailed gas turbine dynamic models. Second, the Modelica language is employed to create the equation-based models, which represent the behavior of a multi-domain physical system. A comparative simulation analysis between the power system domain model and the multi-domain model has been performed. Some differences between the turbine dynamics representation of the commonly used GGOV1 standard model and a more detailed gas turbine model are shown.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2882311","ITEA3; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:EEC-1041877); CURENT Industry Partnership Program; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8540835","CIM;cyber-physical systems;dynamic simulation;equation-based modeling;IEC 61970;information modeling;ISO 15926;Modelica;power systems simulation;power systems modeling","Unified modeling language;Mathematical model;Power system dynamics;Semantics;Turbines;Standards;Common Information Model (electricity)","","8","","39","OAPA","20 Nov 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Yet, business and requirement modeling are often carried out separately by different languages and design teams, leading to misaligned models. The degree of misalignment grows continuously with their independent evolution. Thus, the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully exploited. There is a considerable agreement among researchers about the integration technique roles to bridge the gap between heterogeneous models. Therefore, this approach is based on this technique to align the business world represented by BPMN and the software requirement world represented by the UML use case. We define an integrated meta-model that incorporates all BPMN and use case elements as well as new others to map traceable elements. Further, we define a new diagram that provides a means to visualize and combines their use within an integrated model. Our approach supplements CASE tools with additional information and relationships to maintain the global system consistency. To illustrate it, we implement an editor for designing the proposed diagram, and we apply it in a topical case study.","2161-5330","978-1-5386-9120-5","10.1109/AICCSA.2018.8612870","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8612870","meta-model integration;Alignment;business process models;requirements models;BPMN;UML use case","Unified modeling language;Business;Ontologies;Computational modeling;Software;Semantics;Bridges","","3","","19","IEEE","17 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Popular modeling methods are kill chains and attack graphs. Kill chains divide attacks into phases, and attack graphs depict attack paths. A difficult issue is how to hierarchically model categories of cyber assets that should be used in threat models due to the variety of cyber systems in the current networks. This task should be addressed to provide automation of realistic threat modeling and interoperability with public knowledge bases, such as MITRE ATT&CK. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical modeling methodology for representing cyber assets in kill chain attack graphs. We illustrate its practical application on MITRE D3FEND’s Digital Artifact Ontology. Moreover, we define how cyber assets with related attack techniques should be transformed into logical facts and attack rules. We implemented proof-of-concept software modules that can process data obtained from network and host-based monitoring together with attack rules to generate attack graphs. We evaluated the approach with data from a cyber exercise captured in a network of a digital twin organization. The results show that the approach is applicable in real-world networks and can reveal ground-truth attacks.","2165-963X","978-3-903176-66-9","10.23919/CNSM62983.2024.10814501","Horizon Europe; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10814501","attack graph;kill chain;cyber threat scenario;MITRE ATT&CK;MITRE D3FEND","Threat modeling;Automation;Large language models;Knowledge based systems;Organizations;Ontologies;Software;Security;Risk analysis;Monitoring","","","","20","","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While previous work has addressed blind Image Quality Assessment (IQA) using perceptual and statistical methods, such approaches often overlook a critical dimension - the semantic usability of images. The method assesses digitized images using a combination of objective metrics (e.g., resolution, noise, compression) and semantic tests (e.g. OCR accuracy, layout analysis) with future goal of implementing metadata completeness, Linked Open Data and International Image Interoperability Framework (LOD/IIIF) compatibility in order to provide a composite usability score. The proposed model is grounded in the Image Authenticity and Quality Ontology (IAQO), a lightweight ontology designed to represent assessment outputs in a standardized, machine-readable format. A dataset of 800 public-domain manuscript images was analyzed, yielding average semantic usability scores ranging from 73.8 to 85.4 (out of 100) across repositories. Results demonstrate that high visual fidelity does not always imply high semantic usability but also the framework’s potential to improve digitizing practices.

At the same time, production recipes typically represent important company know-how that should not be directly tied to changing plant configurations. Thus, there is a need to model general production recipes independent of specific plant layouts. For execution of such a recipe however, a binding to then available production resources needs to be made. In this contribution, we select a suitable modeling language to model and execute such recipes. Furthermore, we present an approach to solve the issue of recipe modeling and execution in modular plants using semantically modeled capabilities and skills as well as BPMN. We make use of BPMN to model production recipes using capability processes, i.e. production processes referencing abstract descriptions of resource functions. These capability processes are not bound to a certain plant layout, as there can be multiple resources fulfilling the same capability. For execution, every capability in a capability process is replaced by a skill realizing it, effectively creating a skill process consisting of various skill invocations. The presented solution is capable of orchestrating and executing complex processes that integrate production steps with typical IT functionalities such as error handling, user interactions and notifications. Benefits of the approach are demonstrated using a flexible manufacturing system.","","978-1-6654-9996-5","10.1109/ETFA52439.2022.9921564","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9921564","Capabilities;Skills;Skill-Based Production;Orchestration;BPMN;Ontologies;Semantic Web","Manufacturing industries;Adaptation models;Layout;Production;Companies;Ontologies;Flexible manufacturing systems","","7","","26","IEEE","25 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Those increasing demands as well as today’s product development context of distributed interdisciplinary development teams lead to an increasing complexity of systems as well as their respective development processes. MBSE - Model-Based Systems Engineering is regarded as a promising approach to cope with this complexity. MBSE aims at supporting during the whole product lifecycle in system analysis, requirements management, design as well as verification and validation. Especially validation plays a central role in product development as it is the only activity that can ensure customer satisfaction and thus a successful product on the market. However, comprehensive MBSE-approaches to support validation in product development seem to be missing. This paper describes such a MBSE approach to support validation in product development. The approach includes an ontology of terms and their interrelations in the context of validation. The ontology is used to construct viewpoints, views and a modeling framework to structure a system model in the understanding of MBSE. In addition, a modeling method interacting with the constructed views is developed and presented. The presented approach aims at enabling a continuous validation concept, starting in the early phase of PGE - Product Generation Engineering and continuing throughout the entire lifecycle. Furthermore, the approach should support in integrating the development of products and appropriate validation systems, creating a consistent traceability of information throughout the created models. Finally, a specific focus of the approach lies on usability in order to guarantee individual and organizational acceptance. This acceptance is of particular importance to realize a human centered development as it is envisioned in approaches such as ASE - Advanced Systems Engineering.","2687-8828","978-1-6654-3168-2","10.1109/ISSE51541.2021.9582475","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9582475","MBSE;Validation;Continuous Validation Concept;Modeling Framework;PGE;Product Generation Engineering","Requirements management;Green products;Customer satisfaction;Ontologies;Product development;Complexity theory;Safety","","6","","33","IEEE","28 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Aiming at the problems of poor scalability and automation ability of existing protocol translation methods, this study proposes a Dual Model Mechanism-based Generic Protocol Translation (DMM-GPT) framework. The framework creatively combines ontology-based semantic modeling with state-machine-based behavioral modeling, enabling automated identification of protocol translation bridging points and autonomous construction of a unified protocol state transition model. Firstly, a protocol ontology model is constructed to model the semantic associations between protocol entities. Based on the ontology, semantic information is extracted. Semantic similarities from message level to field level are computed, thereby sequentially identifying message mapping and field mapping relationships. Secondly, modeling protocol behavior through state machine models. Based on the identified mapping relationships, the heterogeneous protocol bridge points are constructed, and a unified state transition model is synthesized automatically. Thus, interoperable behavior between heterogeneous protocols is implemented. Finally, the complete closed loop of protocol interoperability is implemented by applying semantic alignment results to the state transition model. To validate the effectiveness of DMM-GPT, experiments were conducted in two representative scenarios: service discovery (SLP-Bonjour) and IoT communication (HTTP-CoAP). The results demonstrate its effectiveness in enabling interoperability between heterogeneous protocols.","","979-8-3315-2228-5","10.1109/AINIT65432.2025.11035002","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11035002","protocol translation;semantic similarity;ontology modeling;state machine","Seminars;Protocols;Translation;Computational modeling;Scalability;Semantics;Ontologies;Data mining;Information technology;Interoperability","","","","25","IEEE","23 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To define such a framework we will propose a model that relates several dimensions and areas of software development thru time and abstraction levels.

Following these achievements, we consider natural language as a further input language that is used in the design flow for systems and software. Consequently, concepts from integrated development environments (IDE) as they can be found for programming languages such as Java need to be made available for natural language specifications as well. In this paper, we propose lips, an integrated development environment that is seamlessly implemented on top of Eclipse. It contains recent NLP algorithms that extract formal models suited for the Eclipse Modeling Framework and therefore provide a starting point for an ongoing implementation.

In order to provide a mechanism for the efficient enforcement of service-relevant operations in cloud environment, such as service discovery, service provision, and service management, a completed and precise service specification model is highly required. In this paper, we conducted a survey on existing service description languages applied in three different domainsgeneral services, Web/SOA services, and cloud services. We discussed and compared the past literature from seven major aspects, which are: (1) domain, (2) coverage, (3) purpose, (4) representation, (5) semantic expressivity, (6) intended users, and (7) features. Additionally, two core dimensions semantic expressivity and coverage are employed to categorize and analyse the key service description languages by using Magic Quadrant methodology. These two dimensions are regarded as the most essential factors for the evaluation of a service description model. Based on this analysis, we concluded that Unified Service Description Language (USDL) is the language with the widest coverage from business, technical and operational aspects, while OWL-S is the one that has the highest semantic expressivity. At last, critical research issues on cloud service description languages are identified and analysed. The solution of these issues requires more research efforts on the standardization of cloud service specification, which will eventually enhance the development of cloud industry.","","978-1-4673-2561-5","10.1109/SKG.2012.49","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6391820","Cloud computing;Service description language;Semantic expressivity;Coverage","Cloud computing;Business;Unified modeling language;Semantics;Service oriented architecture;Standards","","31","","44","IEEE","24 Dec 2012","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Traditional document representation approaches typically adopt a popular bag-of-word method as the underlying document representation. Although it’s a simple and efficient method, the major shortcoming of bag-of-word representation is in the independent of word feature assumption. Many researchers have attempted to address this issue by incorporating semantic information into document representation. In this paper, we study the effect of semantic representation on the effectiveness of text classification systems. We employed a novel semantic smoothing technique to derive semantic information in a form of mapping probability between topic signatures and single-word features. Two classifiers, Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machine, were selected to carry out the classification experiments.

In order to address this concern, human-centered business rule engines are proposed, which integrate data mining support and provide intelligent user interfaces to collaborating users. An underlying ontology is used to specify the vocabulary for the business rules dependent on the business information system.

Dictionary-based query translation has been a common method in CLIR systems. In these methods we face with the problem of translation ambiguity in which a single word in one language has more than one translation in the other language. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach to retrieve English documents relevant to Persian queries. In this approach we exploit a combination of phrase reorganization, pattern based phrase translation and query expansion before and after translation to improve the dictionary-based query translation. We also propose an improved probabilistic algorithm to choose the best translation of words and phrases. Finally, the documents will be ranked according to statistical language model with some translation steps. Our experimental results show that each of the mentioned methods can bring significant improvement over simple dictionary approaches.","","978-1-4244-2880-9","10.1109/ISCIS.2008.4717868","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4717868","Cross language information retrieval;Semantic ranking;Language mode;Query expansion","Information retrieval;Dictionaries;Natural languages;Statistics;Uncertainty","","4","","16","IEEE","16 Dec 2008","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The advantages that NSAI brings to the field of natural language processing (NLP) have received little attention from researchers in recent years. Therefore, in this review, we focus on the impact of neuro-symbolic approaches for NLP tasks, i.e. text classification, information extraction, machine translation, and language understanding. Relevant research articles from Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were carefully examined using appropriate keywords in the period from 2019 to 2024. The review aims to show the types of NSAI systems, identify the motivation for using NSAI, evaluate the use of additional annotations for content description, and briefly describe how the neuro-symbolic connection improves the methodology and enables trustworthy and explainable AI systems in current NLP research.

The complexity of the problem is due to the diversity of the ontology of the key terms of the cyberphysical thesaurus, the variety of styles of lexicological content, as well as the partial intersection of the content of previously identified ontological categories. In the process of experimental study of hyperparameters of deep ANNs being developed, models of “embedding”, “bag of words” and dense vector representation in Python were compared. On the basis of a systematic approach, an information-morphological matrix of thematic blocks is constructed. In the conducted experiments, the values of parameters such as the number of convolutional blocks, the number of their filters, the type of activation functions, the parameters of the “dropout” layers, etc. were changed. The studied tools provided optimization of hyperparameters of the convolutional network, while the calculation time on the Colaboratory platform for the studied ANN architectures using GPU graphics accelerators was 5…9 o’clock.

Traditional dialogue state tracking methods usually rely on selecting slot values from a fixed ontology to represent the dialogue state. In recent years, more flexible open vocabulary based approaches have become the mainstream focus which are mainly divided into two categories: generative methods and span extraction methods. Among them, the span extraction method is favored for its outstanding ability to predict unknown slot values. However, the span extraction method only focuses on the predicted slot values, but ignores other potential slot values in the utterance, which leads to insufficient semantic understanding of the utterance and difficulty in dealing with complex utterance scenarios, such as more or longer unknown slot values. To tackle the above drawbacks, in this paper, we propose a novel scalable dialogue state tracking method, which employs slot tagging to locate all potential slot values in the utterances and jointly learns slot pointers to select the predicted slot value from them. Specifically, our STN4DST (Slot Tagging Navigation for Dialogue State Tracking) model not only adopts the above joint learning strategy, which we call slot tagging navigation, to extract slot values from utterances, but also uses previous dialogue states as dialogue contexts to track the change of slot values, and introduces appendix slot values to predict special slot values that cannot be extracted. Extensive experiments show that in the open vocabulary setting, STN4DST achieves the state-of-the-art joint goal accuracy of 85.4% and 96.5% on Sim-M and Sim-R datasets with a large number of unknown slot values, and is also comparable to other state-of-the-art models in the absence of token-level slot annotations for all potential slot values.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2024.3393733","MIIT Program(grant numbers:CEIEC-2022-ZM02-0247); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U21B2009,62172039,62276110); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10508456","Task-oriented dialogue system;dialogue state tracking;scalable DST;unknown slot value","Tagging;Navigation;Speech processing;Vocabulary;Semantics;Predictive models;Ontologies","","1","","48","IEEE","25 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The analogue communication of air traffic controllers (ATCo) to pilots has been excluded so far from the digitization process. However, the content of this communication is of decisive importance for various automation systems. Although Assistant Based Speech Recognition (ABSR) has recently significantly improved the recognition performance and, therefore, enables the digitization of ATCo-pilot-communication, its adaptation to other airports is a critical and costly process, This is even more important, if ATCos tend to deviate from the published ICAO phraseology: “start reducing to two fifty” instead of “reduce two five zero knots” is just an example. User acceptance requires that these deviations are also correctly recognized. Therefore, this paper presents an approach, which automatically learns a so-called Command Extraction Model from labelled controller utterances. The initial Command Extraction Model without learning only covers 60% of the commands, whereas the automatically learned Command Extraction Model covers more than 98%. With just six hours of training data we could achieve 94%.","2155-7209","978-1-7281-9825-5","10.1109/DASC50938.2020.9256484","European Union(grant numbers:734141,874464,874470,884287); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9256484","Automatic Speech Recognition;Machine Learning;Annotation;Ontology;Controller Command Extraction Model","Speech recognition;Atmospheric modeling;Adaptation models;Ontologies;Engines;Annotations;Airports","","5","","27","IEEE","18 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A Cognitive solution goes beyond the traditional structured data analysis solutions by deep analyses of both structured and unstructured text. The salient features of the proposed platform include language identification, translation, hierarchical extraction of the most frequently occurring topics, entities and their relationships, text summarization, sentiments and knowledge extraction from the unstructured text using Natural Language Processing techniques. Moreover, the insights from unstructured text combined with structured data allows the development of various classification, segmentation and time-series forecasting use-cases on incident, problem and change datasets. The text and predictive insights together with raw data are used for visualization and exploration of actionable insights on a rich and interactive dashboard. However, it is hard not only to find these insights using traditional Analytics solutions but it might also take very long time to discover them, especially while dealing with massive amount of unstructured data. By taking actions on these insights, organizations can benefit from significant reduction of ticket volume, reduced operational costs and increased customer satisfaction. In various experiments, on average, up to 18-25 % of yearly ticket volume has been reduced using the proposed approach.","","978-1-5386-3360-1","10.1109/ICCI-CC.2018.8482078","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8482078","Knowledge Extraction;Optimizing IT Services;Cognitive Computing;Topic Clustering;Semantic Text Analytics;Service Desk","Feature extraction;Cognitive systems;Customer satisfaction;Data visualization;Semantics;Servers;Social network services","","6","","14","IEEE","7 Oct 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Architectural Design, Urban Planning, and Construction Engineering Domains, even when treated separately, are extremely demanding targets for sophisticated software tools development. While managing the complex urban blocks interactions in the contemporary city configuration, it is particularly important that these three domains cooperate closely. The application of a smart house paradigm is dominantly focused on the internal facility parameters monitoring and control. For the subset of these internal parameters, like for example: daylight illumination; privacy; and natural ventilation, the facility (building) environment impacts analysis is unavoidable. In this article, based on the System-of-Systems paradigm, we present the model of a smart house environment impact analysis framework suitable for Model Driven Simulations of Building (house) Attributes. The proposed framework architecture is designed to support the cooperation/collaboration of software tools. The verification has shown that it may be effectively used for the impact analysis of arbitrary external (urban block specific) attributes on their internal state and the behavior (specific for a single building).","","978-1-5090-4268-5","10.1109/CEWS.2015.7867155","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7867155","Collaborative Work;Cooperative Work;Model Driven Simulations;Urban Block;Smart Houses;System of Systems","Unified modeling language;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Morphology;Data models;Buildings","","9","","19","IEEE","2 Mar 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

As a first step towards this goal, we develop an optical network description language (ONDL). We use it to describe various network components, and their configuration and run-time states, such as modulation schemes, wavelength and spectral-width of a transponder, switching matrix of an optical switch etc. The language is based on resource description framework (RDF). Furthermore, we develop a controller which understands and sends instructions in this language to different network devices to provide/change their states. We show the applicability of ONDL by simulating a network, controlling and managing its nodes using ONDL and developed controller.","","978-1-5386-1224-8","10.1109/NCC.2018.8600201","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8600201","","Optical switches;Optical fiber networks;Resource description framework;Modulation","","1","","12","IEEE","3 Jan 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Among various manufacturing systems, a framework to search past FMEAs and the corresponding causes of the failure requires solving the following problems. First, the difference in products, equipment, and wording to represent them make it difficult to search the similar failure phenomenon from FMEAs. Secondly, the causes of failure highly depend on the process flow of the system until the failure occurs. Therefore, it is also hard to find appropriate failure causes from FMEAs without reflecting on the process. The framework solves the first issue by generalizing descriptions in past FMEAs based on structured concepts of manufacturing systems in an ontology before inference of causes to address. Furthermore, the framework analyzes the correspondence of the process flows between the target manufacturing system and past FMEAs using a process order model generated by SysML diagrams to solve the second issue. The comparison between the causes inferred by the proposed framework and by skilled experts for three typical failures in the manufacturing system and the interview with them about the plausibility of the inference results showed that more than 73 % of them were valid.","2159-6255","978-1-6654-7633-1","10.1109/AIM46323.2023.10196264","New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10196264","","Analytical models;Mechatronics;Ontologies;Maintenance engineering;Search problems;Cognition;Data models","","2","","13","IEEE","2 Aug 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

There are many currently available diagrams or visual modeling languages for managerial needs, unfortunately the choice between them is frequently error-prone and inconsistent. This situation raises the next questions. What diagrams/ visual modeling languages are the most suitable for the specific type of business content? What domain-specific diagrams are the most suitable for the visualization of the particular elements of organizational ontology? In order to provide the answers, the paper suggests light-weight specification of diagrams and knowledge content types, which is based on the competency questions and ontology design patterns. The proposed approach provides the classification of qualitative business diagrams.","","978-83-60810-52-1","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6644176","","Ontologies;Visualization;Business;Educational institutions;Unified modeling language;Data visualization;Complexity theory","","","","29","","7 Nov 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The dominant thinking in this realm is to classify objects that share certain properties into what is called a class, which in turn enables us to instantiate additional objects. Deep modeling takes a step further by introducing the notion of clabject that might be instantiated multiple times until its instantiation potency runs out. This initiative has gained a lot of momentum of late, primarily due to the inadequacy of the classical mechanics of two-level object instantiation. There exists a less familiar way of reasoning in object-orientation that takes its root from the prototype theory. We believe that they co-exist as two sides of the same coin. Unfortunately, prototype-based modeling still stays on the sidelines in the mainstream of conceptual modeling and related areas (e.g., enterprise modeling). In this paper, we argue that the two methods actually complement each other. We propose a hybrid modeling suite that allows for both instantiation and cloning in enterprise modeling. We formally state that a clabject not only features the so-called potency (i.e., for how many levels this clabject might further be classified) but also carries the notion of characteristics (i.e., the extent to which this clabject resembles those being represented). We demonstrate our novel ways of modeling for capturing business processes in a service-oriented enterprise architecture.","2325-6605","978-1-7281-4598-3","10.1109/EDOCW.2019.00036","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8907289","Multilevel Classification, Business Process Modeling, Prototype Theory, Enterprise Modeling","Process modeling;Object oriented modeling;Computational modeling;Conferences;Prototypes;Cloning;Computer architecture;Cognition;Business","","2","","38","IEEE","21 Nov 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While a document-centric approach has been common practice, coping with the growing complexity of current systems calls for a model-based approach. This work discusses two systems modeling languages, OMG's SysML - Systems Modeling Language and OPM - Object Process Methodology. To demonstrate the similarities and differences between the languages, a concrete sample system was modeled in both SysML and OPM and the issue was discussed in an experimental graduate students' Web-based forum as part of a course in information systems engineering. Our study shows that SysML tends to be more appropriate in cases where a detailed picture is required. Alternatively, OPM is more suitable for defining system boundaries and demonstrating the overall picture of the system.","","1-4244-0770-2","10.1109/ICSEM.2007.373339","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4243724","","Unified modeling language;Systems engineering and theory;Concrete;Information systems;Tellurium;Ontologies;Taxonomy;Software standards;Software engineering;Software systems","","23","","9","IEEE","18 Jun 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

ERP systems usually deal with the two types of business processes, i.e., exchange and conversion. In the exchange process, economic resource, such as product, exchanges to another economic resource, such as the sales process. In a conversion process, an enterprise consumes resources in order to produce new resources, such as the distribution process. Generally, the communication between ERP applications, based on the conversion and exchange processes, is accomplished through Web services. In this context, the implementation of Web services in ERP systems is a complex task. To manage this, the business process model and notation (BPMN) are frequently utilized to simplify the development of ERP applications. However, state-of-the-art BPMN approaches usually deal with the modeling of exchange processes without considering the conversion process. Furthermore, the model transformation solution to automatically generate Web services from the BPMN models are hard to find in the literature. Therefore, in this paper, a novel framework is proposed that supports the modeling of both exchanges as well as conversion processes through BPMN. Particularly, a modeling approach is introduced to represent the ERP processes through BPMN concepts. Subsequently, the rules are developed to convert source BPMN models into target Service-oriented architecture Modeling Language (SoaML) models. Finally, transformation rules are developed to generate fully functional executable Java Web services from SoaML models. As a part of the research, a complete open-source BPMN to Web services transformation (B2W) tool is developed to automatically generate the Web services from the high-level BPMN models. The proposed framework is validated through multiple case studies. The experimental results prove that the proposed framework accurately generates Web services from the BPMN models, which eventually helps in developing the ERP systems with simplicity.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2927785","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8758422","Model-driven engineering (MDE);business process model and notation (BPMN);service oriented architecture (SOA);ERP systems;service generation","Business;Biological system modeling;Unified modeling language;Economics;Service-oriented architecture;Ontologies","","13","","41","CCBY","9 Jul 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, EA is a challenging concept and a number of heterogeneous architecture definitions, interpretations and classifications have been developed. It is imperative that an EA programme is considered not only as an issue for the Information Technology (IT) function, but also as a strategic and organisational challenge. Organisations embarking on an EA programme are faced with many complex decisions regarding which EA framework to select, which models and modelling notations to use, as well which technology strategies to adopt. Some organisations are embracing these programmes and are obtaining many benefits, others are faced with an abundance of challenges.

Many existing modeling languages that support the design of such systems are based on ontologies to assist the representation of agents knowledge. However, in the context of DESs, there is still a need for more general conceptual models to represent the specific characteristics of DESs in terms of win-win interaction, engagement, equilibrium, and self-organization. Then, concepts such behavior, roles, rules, and environment are needed. This paper describes an ontology-based approach by proposing MAS2DES-Onto, as the conceptual model, which considers the essential static and dynamic aspects of MASs by a clear representation of their concepts and relationships to support the design and development of DESs. To validate and conduct experimental tests, we integrate MAS2DES-Onto into a framework to automatically generate MAS-based DESs.

However, the presence of demographic terms in commonsense knowledge poses a potential risk of compromising the performance of NLP models. This study aims to investigate and propose methods for enhancing the performance and effectiveness of a commonsense polarization classifier by mitigating the influence of demographic terms. Three methods are introduced in this paper: (1) hierarchical generalization of demographic terms (2) threshold-based augmentation and (3) integration of hierarchical generalization and threshold-based augmentation methods(IHTA). The first method involves replacing demographic terms with more general ones based on a term hierarchy ontology, aiming to mitigate the influence of specific terms. To address the limited bias-related information, the second method measures the polarization of demographic terms by comparing the changes in the model’s predictions when these terms are masked versus unmasked. This method augments commonsense sentences containing terms with high polarization values by replacing their predicates with synonyms generated by ChatGPT. The third method combines the two approaches, starting with threshold-based augmentation followed by hierarchical generalization. The experiments show that the first method increases the accuracy over the baseline by 2.33%, and the second one by 0.96% over standard augmentation methods. The IHTA techniques yielded an 8.82% and 9.96% higher accuracy than threshold-based and standard augmentation methods, respectively.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3477599","MSIT (Ministry of Science and ICT [Information and Communication Technology]), Korea, under the ITRC (Information Technology Research Center) support program(grant numbers:IITP-2024-2020-0-01789); Artificial Intelligence Convergence Innovation Human Resources Development(grant numbers:IITP-2024-RS-2023-00254592); IITP (Institute for Information and Communications Technology Planning and Evaluation); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10713368","Commonsense bias;demographic term;bias mitigation;hierarchical generalization;threshold-based augmentation","Accuracy;Predictive models;Commonsense reasoning;Standards;Ontologies;Chatbots;Training data;Systematics;Semantics;Prevention and mitigation;Demography;Natural language processing;Classification algorithms","","","","25","CCBYNCND","10 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The improvement obtained is often rather small, however the structure and the relations between words obtained through parsing can be of great interest for the SLU processes, even without a significant decrease of WER. That is why we adopt another point of view in this paper: considering that ASR transcriptions contain inevitably some errors, we show in this study that it is possible to improve the syntactic analysis of these erroneous transcriptions by performing a joint error detection / syntactic parsing process.

Such measures are useful for achieving organizational success. Therefore, a good representation of KPIs is required; a good knowledge representation should exhibit the following features: (i) proficiency in computational tractability; (ii) clear and accurate syntax; (iii) clear and accurate semantics; (iv) stakeholder understandability; and (v) extensibility. Several approaches have been proposed for representing KPIs; however, they are incomplete; and they exhibit some of the aforementioned drawbacks. In this paper we propose an executable pre-conceptual schema to achieve an appropriate knowledge representation of KPIs. This work demonstrates the benefits of using such a schema by developing a case study, and by providing a comparison of our proposal against relevant studies aimed at representing KPIs.","","978-1-4799-1056-4","10.1109/ColombianCC.2013.6637526","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6637526","programming and software engineering;KPI;measure;metric;indicator;performance;knowledge representation;pre-conceptual schemas","Proposals;Semantics;Unified modeling language;Syntactics;Ontologies","","3","","20","IEEE","21 Oct 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Furthermore, while MBSE environments are highly capable of supporting the description of design baselines, the current capabilities within these environments could be further refined for exploring alternative designs. As a result it is important to gain an understanding of the limitations of current MBSE tooling in performing the valuable activity of design space exploration, and identify a set of candidate techniques to combat these. This paper reviews the various options available to MBSE practitioners by comparing some of the most common MBSE languages, tools and methods. The possible issues that can be encountered when exploring different designs have been identified and assigned a severity rating. A set of design space exploration techniques are presented, and where possible these have been sourced from existing literature. A knowledge graph has been constructed to collect all this data into a structured format, containing all the MBSE languages, tools, methods, design space exploration-related issues and techniques, as well as the relationships between each of these. This knowledge graph, implemented as a Neo4j graph database, allowed deeper insights to be drawn from the collected information. By defining a selected MBSE environment, including language, tool and method, the knowledge graph could be used to identify the least troublesome sequence (with minimum number of related issues) to arrive at a desired design artifact, for example a set of optimized system parameters. Beside this, the knowledge graph could be used to display the relationships and clusters of MBSE languages, tools and methods, to assist organizations with selecting suitable MBSE environment elements. Future work will bring greater depth to the analysis available with the knowledge graph, for instance, differentiation between different types of design space exploration issues and techniques.","1095-323X","979-8-3503-0462-6","10.1109/AERO58975.2024.10521188","Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10521188","","Codes;Reviews;Databases;Design methodology;Knowledge based systems;Knowledge graphs;Organizations","","1","","80","IEEE","13 May 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Recent computational approaches to SLU, e.g., conditional random fields (CRFs), optimize local models by encoding several features, mainly based on simple n-grams. In contrast, recent works have shown that the accuracy of CRF can be significantly improved by modeling long-distance dependency features. In this paper, we propose novel approaches to encode all possible dependencies between features and most importantly among parts of the meaning structure, e.g., concepts and their combination. We rerank hypotheses generated by local models, e.g., stochastic finite state transducers (SFSTs) or CRF, with a global model. The latter encodes a very large number of dependencies (in the form of trees or sequences) by applying kernel methods to the space of all meaning (sub) structures. We performed comparative experiments between SFST, CRF, support vector machines (SVMs), and our proposed discriminative reranking models (DRMs) on representative conversational speech corpora in three different languages: the ATIS (English), the MEDIA (French), and the LUNA (Italian) corpora. These corpora have been collected within three different domain applications of increasing complexity: informational, transactional, and problem-solving tasks, respectively.

Image's regions are described using a vocabulary of blobs generated from image features using the K-means clustering algorithm. Using SAIAPR TC-12 Dataset of annotated images it is estimated the joint probability of generating a word given the blobs in an image. The annotation process of each new image starts with a segmentation phase. An original and efficient segmentation algorithm based on a hexagonal structure is applied to obtain the list of regions. Each meaningful word assigned to the annotated image is retrieved from an ontology derived in an original manner starting from the hierarchical vocabulary associated with SAIAPR TC-12 and from the spatial relationships between regions.","","978-83-60810-39-2","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6078284","Image annotation;image segmentation;ontology;relevance models","Image segmentation;Hidden Markov models;Feature extraction;Image color analysis;Ontologies;Algorithm design and analysis;Training","","","","8","","14 Nov 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While limited labeled data may drastically hurt the models’ performance (over-fitting), large demands on annotation tasks may turn real-world applications impracticable.

Automation is needed to ensure that contracts respect desirable properties and to support monitoring of compliance and handling of violations.

The consequences of hoist failure are severe, particularly when the root cause of the malfunction is not promptly identified and addressed, potentially compromising the overall safety of mining activities. The complexity of mine hoist systems stems from the interdependent and restrictive relationships among their components, each of which generates unique operational state information. This information, when aggregated and processed, can be distilled into various fault characteristic parameters. This paper introduces a novel approach to fault diagnosis within mine hoist systems by constructing a fault knowledge graph based on ontological principles. The proposed method harnesses the power of knowledge graphs to systematically represent and analyze the complex interplay of components within the hoist system. By doing so, it enhances the diagnostic capabilities and the preemptive identification of potential faults. The research focuses on the mine hoist as the subject of study and proposes the development of an ontologically-based fault knowledge graph. This approach is not only of significant importance to the coal mining industry but also offers innovative insights for knowledge graph construction across various domains. The implications of this study extend beyond the mining sector, providing a foundation for more robust and intelligent fault diagnosis systems in complex mechanical systems.","","979-8-3503-7510-7","10.1109/CISAT62382.2024.10695412","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10695412","artificial intelligence;entity recognition;fault knowledge graph;mine hoist;relation extraction","Fault diagnosis;Information science;Instruments;Knowledge graphs;Named entity recognition;Information retrieval;Safety;Complexity theory;Mechanical systems;Lifting equipment","","","","18","IEEE","2 Oct 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

MBSE is an effective approach for demonstrating multidisciplinary coupling relationships needed to meet specific requirements. By integrating MBSE with MDAO, it is possible to realize traceability from MDAO elements and results to the corresponding system elements and requirements, and to keep data consistency. This paper discusses a method of semantically linking MBSE and MDAO by establishing a MDAO domainspecific metamodel as a SysML profile. This approach positions MDAO as a viewpoint for vehicle development. MBSE serves as the overarching framework throughout different lifecycle stages, ensuring the consistency of MDAO specification. An instantiation of MDAO metamodel has been established to present a coupled multidisciplinary problem structure.","2472-9647","979-8-3315-0818-0","10.1109/SysCon64521.2025.11014844","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11014844","Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE);Multidisciplinary Design Analysis and Optimization (MDAO);Metamodel;Early verification & validation (V&V);SysML","Hands;Couplings;Analytical models;Semantics;Data models;Complexity theory;Modeling;Optimization;Next generation networking;Automotive engineering","","","","24","IEEE","30 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This method describes foundation, technique, modeling language and document structure for develop the knowledge-based system. COMMONKADS is people-oriented system development methodology, and this methodology is often used for developing organizational knowledge management system. COMMONKADS approach is divided based on context (organizational model, task model, agent model), concept (knowledge model) and artifact (design model). COMMONKADS have been used widely for knowledge-based system in several fields, such as COMMONKADS that integrated in tourism knowledge-based system, COMMONKADS for irrigation expert system, expertise model using COMMONKADS in manufactured company, COMMONKADS in energy management system and many more. Generally, there are eight strengths of COMMONKADS methodology for develop knowledge-based system. Its strength is flexible to use in any scope, represent knowledge (organizational, domain, task and inference knowledge), complete (representation, model, and form), powerful, accurate, comprehensive, represent KM process, systematic and effective. While the weakness of COMMONKADS methodology only three, there are don't have validation process and difficult to acquisition knowledge and use semi formal language, large data storage.

In this study, we regard the task of biomedical entity normalization as a ranking problem and propose an approach to rank normalized concepts. We additionally employ two factors that can notably affect the performance of normalization, such as task-specific pre-training (Task-PT) and calibration approach.

Rubin","SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego, CA, USA",Proceedings Fifth IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications,"8 Jan 2004","2003","","","144","149","Contemporary neural architectures having one or more hidden layers suffer from the same deficiencies that genetic algorithms and methodologies for non-trivial automatic programming do; namely, they cannot exploit inherent domain symmetries for the transference of knowledge from an application of lesser to greater rank, or across similar applications. As a direct consequence, no ensemble of contemporary neural architectures allows for the effective codification and transference of knowledge within a society of individuals (i.e., swarm knowledge). These deficiencies stem from the fact that contemporary neural architectures cannot reason symbolically using heuristic ontologies. They cannot directly provide symbolic explanations of what was learned for purposes of inspection and verification. Moreover, they do not allow the knowledge engineer to precondition the internal feature space through the application of domain-specific modeling languages. A symbolic representation can support the heuristic evolution of an ensemble of neural architectures. Each neural network in the ensemble imbues a hidden layer and for this reason is NP-hard in its learning performance. It may be argued that the internal use of a neat representation subsumes the heuristic evolution of a scruffy one. It follows that there is a duality of representation under transformation. The goal of AI then is to find symbolic representations, transformations, and associated heuristic ontologies. This paper provides an introduction to this quest. Consider the game of chess for example. If a neural network or symbolic heuristic is used to evaluate board positions, then the best found iterate (i.e., of weights or symbols) serves as a starting point for iterative refinement. This paper addresses the ordering and similarity of the training instances in refining subsequent iterates. If we fix the learning technology, then we need to focus on reducing the problem, composing intermediate results, and transferring the results to a similar domain. For example, moving just a bishop against one opposing piece is a reduction, moving a bishop and say a rook against one opposing piece a composition, and moving a queen against one or more opposing pieces a transference. The training sets must be mutually orthogonal, or random to maximize the learned content. Learning what to present and when involves self-reference and this necessarily implies a heuristic approach.","","0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251407","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251407","","Neural networks;Ontologies;Genetic algorithms;Automatic programming;Inspection;Knowledge engineering;Machine learning;Sensor phenomena and characterization;USA Councils;Domain specific languages","","1","","12","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper presents a methodological approach to the design and development of complex automation systems relying on model-driven engineering (MDE). A benefit of this approach is the integration of methods and techniques widespread within the automation discipline with modern MDE techniques guiding the designer through the development phases. A second advantage is to add flexibility enough to adapt the steps to the needs of the system under design. Finally, the architecture presented is prepared to be adapted to methodology extensions to cover other aspects of automation systems. The framework is based on domain models that are defined through the development phases using the terminology of the automation field. Using model transformations both documentation about system analysis and design and the skeleton of software units are automatically generated. A proof-of-concept tool has been developed that has been tested on the design of medium-complexity projects to assess the impact of its use with respect to project documentation and maintenance.Note to Practitioners—Control software development can be considered one of the challenges in automation field for achieving leadership in the future economic market. This work presents a model-driven engineering-based approach making use of both automation and software engineering methods and techniques for developing automation control systems. The framework implements the methodology for industrial automation systems ( ${\rm MeiA}_{\bullet }$ ) for guiding developers through the development phases and generates the analysis and design documentation using domain terminology, the design documentation that involves the minimal units of design, and the program organization units in one-to-one correspondence with the minimal units of design.

This conceptualization should reflect the goals pursued by the EA management endeavor and focus on the areas of interest of the involved stakeholders.

These models are typically described in an object-oriented manner utilizing concepts like class, property, and relationship. Specific aspects relevant in the area of EA management, such as temporality, property-dependency, and cross-cutting aspects are more often than not neglected in this approaches. In this paper, we addresses the challenge of conceptualizing cross-cutting aspects in EA modeling. Cross-cutting aspects refer to EA-related concepts, like goals or projects, which may exert influence on other concepts of the EA model. Therefore, the state-of-the-art in EA conceptualization is revisited resulting in the identification of four cross-cutting aspects of EA modeling: goals, lifecycles, projects, and standards.

This paper introduces Recover, a neuro-symbolic framework for online failure identification and recovery. By integrating ontologies, logical rules, and LLM-based planners, Recover exploits symbolic information to enhance the ability of LLMs to generate recovery plans and also to decrease the associated costs. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of our method in a simulated kitchen environment, we introduce OntoThor, an ontology describing the AI2Thor simulator setting. Empirical evaluation shows that OntoThor’s logical rules accurately detect all failures in the analyzed tasks, and that Recover considerably outperforms, for both failure detection and recovery, a baseline method reliant solely on LLMs. Supplementary material, including the OntoThor ontology, is available at: https://recover-ontothor.github.io.","2153-0866","979-8-3503-7770-5","10.1109/IROS58592.2024.10801853","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10801853","","Costs;Large language models;Ontologies;Intelligent robots","","4","","29","IEEE","25 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The second part of this paper is bringing training data set from the final judgment to train with deep learning methods. Due to the training set which have severe imbalances, the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling TEchnique (SMOTE) [1] is used to solve this problem. Models are trained on the training set using unidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [2] networks and bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) [3] are type of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [2]. The word embeddings of the dataset can be learned while training a deep neural network. BiLSTM average F1 score is higher than LSTM.

However, few seem to have asked what are the requirements for the system model? In this paper, we use a requirements process to elicit and define the requirements for the system model. The system model is a digital artifact containing descriptions of all the essential objects, their properties, and the relationships between them for the system-of-interest (SoI). The paper describes the context of the system model in relationships to the other components of model-based systems engineering (MBSE) consisting of a modeling language, schema, model-based process, presentation framework, MBSE tools, and knowledgeable workforce. The paper describes how these components interact to provide effective MBSE. Requirements are stated for each component. The paper additionally derives information requirements for the system model according to the systems engineering process’s information needs by examining the inputs and outputs of each activity in the systems engineering process. Lastly, the paper derives the quality characteristics for the system model from the literature on ontologies, modeling languages, and semiotics. The result is a set of requirements for the system model to support MBSE and the digital thread.","2472-9647","978-1-6654-4439-2","10.1109/SysCon48628.2021.9447088","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447088","","Context;Conferences;Project management;Tools;Ontologies;IEEE Standards;Data models","","4","","28","USGov","9 Jun 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It is necessary to extract information about specific types of cells, their roles in the text, detect the immunosuppressive properties of cell populations, and certain types of relationships. It is also crucial to filter out those texts, which describe immunosuppressive features of different chemical compounds or drugs. Typically, efficient automatic information extraction requires a relatively large set of samples or marked-up texts. The paper presents a novel information extraction method that can be useful for such an analysis. This method uses external linguistic resources and can be trained on limited corpora. Namely, the method combines medical ontologies, rich unsupervised lexis representations (Fasttext word embeddings) with rule-based entity and relationship extraction, and supervised machine learning-based post-filtering. The developed method allows one to extract information about the target cells (for “in vitro” experiments), effector cells, diseases (""in vivo”), and arbitrary descriptions of immune suppression. In the paper, we also present a manually labeled corpus to train immunosuppressive information extraction methods. That corpus contains texts of 330 PubMed Central abstracts. The experiments on that corpus show the method has relatively high evaluation scores on the labeled dataset. Therefore, the proposed method makes it possible to identify descriptions of the immunosuppressive properties of cell populations in biomedical texts with sufficiently high quality. In the future, the method can be applied to perform an automatic meta-analysis of research in immunosuppressive cell therapy.","","978-1-6654-3149-1","10.1109/CSGB53040.2021.9496030","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9496030","biomedical information extraction;relational-situational analysis;properties of immunosuppressive cells","Sociology;Medical treatment;Genomics;Linguistics;Tools;Ontologies;Information filters","","","","25","IEEE","27 Jul 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nevertheless, privacy notices are a central element, often mandated by law.We approach the problem by (partially) relieving the human from the task of inspecting such documents. Because they are documents written in natural language, often legal language, we assess the feasibility of representing privacy notices in a machine-readable format. Should this be feasible, automated processing of notices that still respect individual choices could be enabled. To this end, we manually inspected privacy notices under EU/UK's GDPR from common websites, and designed a JSON schema that captures their structure.","","979-8-3503-9588-4","10.1109/BESC59560.2023.10386763","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10386763","","Privacy;Social computing;Art;Law;Natural languages;Task analysis","","","","49","IEEE","17 Jan 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

This paper proposes a novel tree-constrained pointer generator (TCPGen) component that enables end-to-end ASR models to bias towards a list of long-tail words obtained using external contextual information. With only a small overhead in memory use and computation cost, TCPGen can structure thousands of biasing words efficiently into a symbolic prefix-tree, and creates a neural shortcut between the tree and the final ASR output to facilitate the recognition of the biasing words. To enhance TCPGen, we further propose a novel minimum biasing word error (MBWE) loss that directly optimises biasing word errors during training, along with a biasing-word-driven language model discounting (BLMD) method during the test. All contextual ASR systems were evaluated on the public Librispeech audiobook corpus and the data from the dialogue state tracking challenges (DSTC) with the biasing lists extracted from the dialogue-system ontology. Consistent word error rate (WER) reductions were achieved with TCPGen, which were particularly significant on the biasing words with around 40% relative reductions in the recognition error rates. MBWE and BLMD further improved the effectiveness of TCPGen, and achieved more significant WER reductions on the biasing words. TCPGen also achieved zero-shot learning of words not in the audio training set with large WER reductions on the out-of-vocabulary words in the biasing list.","2329-9304","","10.1109/TASLP.2022.3224286","International Scholarship offered by Cambridge Trust; University of Cambridge Research Computing Service; EPSRC Tier-2(grant numbers:EP/T022159/1); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9961919","Contextual speech recognition;end-to-end;language model discounting;minimum Bayes' risk;Pointer generator","Training;Generators;Decoding;Hidden Markov models;Context modeling;Speech recognition;Error analysis","","6","","67","CCBY","23 Nov 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The knowledge about the UoD is obtained from a variety of sources, all of which are mostly expressed in a natural language. It is correct to say that conceptual modeling is much similar to language translation i.e., identifying concepts that are represented by signs of a language, and then representing those same concepts in a different language. Also, the semantic quality of the resulting model (translation) is directly affected by the modeler's (translator's) understanding of the source material. As so, conceptual modeling activities can benefit from an analysis carried out from a linguistic point of view, as well as from the use of a modeling language which constructs allow for a representation that is semantically equivalent to the natural language original descriptions.

In fact, today these IoT devices continuously take part in various business processes that are being executing within the boundaries of the same enterprise or in different enterprises. Thus, there is an evident need to model these processes that are associated with IoT resources in a formal and unambiguous manner. However, in context of business processes, these is a lack of formalized and explicit description for IoT resources, thus hampering their efficient modeling and management. To bridge this gap, we propose a semantic framework for developing IoT-aware business processes as follows, (i) formalizing IoT resource description w.r.t Internet of Things Architecture (IoT-A) reference model in context of business processes, (ii) formalizing IoT properties and allocation rules for optimal resource management and (iii) resolving resource conflicts based on strategies.

They normally express the UI and the application logic, which allows generating the frontend and basic CRUD operations. However, more complex domain logic (data processing) operations still necessitate the use of traditional programming. This paper presents a visual language, called RSL-DL, to represent domain knowledge with complex domain rules aligned with requirements models. The language synthesises and extends approaches found in knowledge representation (ontologies) and software modelling language engineering. Its purpose is to enable a fully automatic generation of domain logic code by reasoning over and reusing domain knowledge. The language’s abstract syntax is defined using a meta-model expressed in MOF. Its semantics is expressed with several translational rules that map RSL-DL models onto typical programming language constructs. The rules are explained informally in natural language and formalised using a graphical transformation notation. It is also supported by introducing an inference engine that enables processing queries to domain models and selecting appropriate invocations to generated code. The presented language was implemented by building a dedicated model editor and transformation engine. It was also initially validated through usability studies. Based on these results, we conclude that declarative knowledge representations can be successfully used to produce imperative back-end code with non-trivial logic.","","978-83-962423-9-6","10.15439/2022F129","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9909441","","Visualization;Codes;Computational modeling;Semantics;Syntactics;Programming;Ontologies","","","","39","","10 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

To this end the ""Decision Ontology for System Architectures (DOSA)"" is developed to provide a formalized data model to capture system architecture decisions. DOSA is developed through a synthesis of decisions observed while developing an architecture model for a preliminary study of a novel satellite navigation system at Airbus Defence and Space. The approach is integrated into an MBSE framework enabling engineers to capture decisions that influence the architecture’s characteristics while developing the system model and imminently trace decision to artifacts of the system architecture.

Most existing methods for few-shot ED use event ontology and related knowledge to construct prototypes and fail to fully leverage the rich knowledge of pre-trained language models (PLMs) which could help improve the representation of prototypes. Motivated by this, we propose an prompt-enhanced prototype framework which combines prototype and prompt for few-shot ED. Considering the scarcity of labeled data, we also introduce contrastive learning to enrich prototypes. Specifically, we use heuristic rules to align FrameNet with annotated data to get corresponding prompts for each event and convert them into prompt prototype. We then leverage contrastive learning to aggregate event mentions into prototypes and maintain these prototypes for few-shot ED. Furthermore, We explore diverse prompt formats for representing prompt prototypes and introduce a more comprehensive lexical prompt which improves the performance of few-shot ED. We conduct extensive experiments on the MAVEN corpus to reveal the effectiveness of the proposed framework compared to state-of-the-art methods.","2161-4407","979-8-3503-5931-2","10.1109/IJCNN60899.2024.10651359","National Natural Science Foundation of China; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10651359","","Event detection;Annotations;Aggregates;Semantics;Neural networks;Prototypes;Contrastive learning","","1","","39","IEEE","9 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

"1 Semantic Search Engine in Industry 4.0","O. E. Godspower; P. E. Esingbemi",NA; NA,Semantic Technologies for Intelligent Industry 4.0 Applications,"","2023","","","1","24","As the world enters the era of big data, there is a serious need to give a semantic perspective to the data in order to find unseen patterns, derive meaningful information, and make intelligent decisions. Semantic technologies offer the richest machine-interpretable (rather than just machine-processable) and explicit semantics that are being extensively used in various domains and industries. These technologies reduce the problem of large semantic loss in the process of modelling knowledge, and provide sharable, reusable knowledge, and a common understanding of the knowledge. As a result, the interoperability and interconnectivity of the model make it priceless for addressing the issues of querying data. These technologies work with the concepts and relations that are very close to the working of the human brain. They provide a semantic representation of any data format: unstructured or semi-structured. As a consequence, data becomes real-world entity rather than a string of characters. For these reasons, semantic technologies are highly valuable tools to simplify the existing problems of the industry leading to new opportunities. However, there are some challenges that need to be addressed to make industrial applications and machines smarter. This book aims to provide a roadmap for semantic technologies and highlights the role of these technologies in industry. The book also explores the present and future prospects of these semantic technologies along with providing answers to various questions like: Are semantic technologies useful for the next era (industry 4.0)? Why are semantic technologies so popular and extensively used in the industry? Can semantic technologies make intelligent industrial applications? Which type of problem requires the immediate attention of researchers? Why are semantic technologies very helpful in people’s future lives? This book will potentially serve as an important guide towards the latest industrial applications of semantic technologies for the upcoming generation, and thus becomes a unique resource for scholars, researchers, professionals and practitioners in the field.","","9788770227810","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=10144419.pdf&bkn=10144417&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","5 Jun 2023","","","River Publishers","River eBook Chapters"

Designing such an SoS is a multidisciplinary problem which involves considering emergent phenomena, assuring the achievement of dependability and security requirements, guaranteeing system responsiveness, supporting dynamicity and evolution and multi-criticality of provided services. We believe that a first step towards a viable design approach is to provide a conceptual model of SoSs which captures SoS concepts (e.g., methods, characteristics, and technologies related to SoSs) and their inter-relationships. Such a conceptual model should enhance the understandability of SoSs to stakeholders and provide the basis for further automated analysis. In this context, the AMADEOS European project is bringing together researchers and practitioners to provide the support to design SoSs starting from the definition of a domain specific ontology serving as a vocabulary for SoSs. Our contribution consists of semi-formalizing the key SoS concepts and relationships defined in AMADEOS adopting a SysML visual modeling language.

Blockchain is a popular, decentralized, efficient, and secure technology that enables transparent and tamper-resistant transactions across distributed networks. However, blockchain systems lack a dedicated modeling language to represent Blockchain-Based Applications (BBAs) and related Smart Contracts (SCs). Recent research has introduced adaptations of well-known graphical notations to meet the unique modeling needs of blockchain systems. This paper proposes a structured review of graphical models, techniques, and languages to enhance Blockchain-Oriented Software Engineering (BOSE) modeling. A detailed analysis of 36 studies published between 2018 and 2023 highlights the trends and developments in blockchain modeling, and a classification of modified modeling techniques and languages for BBAs and SCs is presented. A modeling framework that guides blockchain developers in describing, designing, and documenting BBAs and related SCs is developed, and an example is provided to demonstrate how this framework is used.

This article illustrates a service-oriented approach to support model integration for model-based systems engineering, especially between architecture design and system verification. First, a set of semantic mapping rules between architecture models and simulation models based on Open Service of Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) are proposed to support the formalization of technical resources (models, data, APIs). Then OSLC adapters are developed to transform models, data and APIs into web-based services. The services are deployed by a service discovering plug-in within a specific modeling tool for model information exchange. The approach is illustrated by a case study on KARMA architecture model and Modelica simulation model for a six-degree-of-freedom robot (RobotR3) system.

However, conducting security risk assessments along the engineering process is a costly and labor-intensive endeavor due to the complexity of the system(s) under consideration and the lack of automated methods. This, in turn, hampers the ability of security analysts to assess risks pertaining to cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in an efficient manner. In this work, we propose a method that automatically identifies security risks based on the CPS's data representation, which exists within engineering artifacts. To lay the foundation for our method, we present security-focused semantics for the engineering data exchange format AutomationML (AML). These semantics enable the reuse of security-relevant know-how in AML artifacts by means of a formal knowledge representation, modeled with a security-enriched ontology. Our method is capable of automating the identification of security risk sources and potential consequences in order to construct cyber-physical attack graphs that capture the paths adversaries may take. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method through a case study and an open-source prototypical implementation. Finally, we prove that our solution is scalable by conducting a rigorous performance evaluation.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2020.3033150","Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft; Austrian Federal Ministry for Digital and Economic Affairs; Österreichische Nationalstiftung für Forschung, Technologie und Entwicklung; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9237126","Cyber-physical systems;information security;AutomationML;security modeling;security risk assessment;industrial control systems;IEC 62443","Security;IEC Standards;Risk management;Topology;Semantics;Data models;Knowledge engineering","","41","","65","IEEE","22 Oct 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, the temporal relation among the frames in a visual shot is characterized by a visual language model. The language model-based temporal relation is then applied to sentence-based alignment. The bag-of-word representations for the main objects in the key frames of a visual shot are firstly mapped to the visual patterns trained from the news video database. Furthermore, the textual terms in the report sentence are mapped to the textual concepts that are obtained from the HowNet knowledge base. Finally, unsupervised alignment between the textual concepts and the visual patterns in the news videos is performed using the IBM model-1. For evaluation, the visual pattern language model yields an alignment score of 0.77, exceeding that, 0.66, from the DTW method.

One of the key technologies for achieving this will undoubtedly be cloud computing which opens up many new opportunities for streamlining the way computing services are delivered and used. Several research projects have therefore recently started to examine ways of improving the efficiency of cloud computing infrastructures and of understanding the energy efficiency of computing algorithms. However, to date these have mainly focused on increasing the efficiency of cloud computing services at the relatively low ""platform"" and ""infrastructure"" levels of abstraction at which they are typically offered today. In this paper we argue that to maximize the environmental benefits of cloud computing, both from the demand as well as the supply point of view, it is necessary to raise the level of abstraction at which cloud services are delivered and consumed. To this end, we introduce the vision of ""Modelling as a Service (MaaS)"" and explain how it provides an essential foundation for reducing the environmental impact of computing services.","2378-3818","978-1-4577-0879-4","10.1109/SERVICES.2011.19","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6012786","Clouds;Energy efficiency;Green design;Metamodeling;Software engineering","Unified modeling language;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Software;DSL;Software engineering;Optimization","","4","","10","IEEE","8 Sep 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The semantic similarity metrics that are evaluated and combined are based on narrow- and wide-context vector- product similarity. The metrics are combined using linear weights that are computed 'on the fly' and are updated at each iteration of the class induction algorithm, forming a corpus-independent metric. Specifically, the weight of each metric is selected to be inversely proportional to the inter-class similarity of the classes induced by that metric and for the current iteration of the algorithm. The proposed algorithms are evaluated on two corpora: a semantically heterogeneous news domain (HR-Net) and an application-specific travel reservation corpus (ATIS). It is shown, that the (unsupervised) adaptive weighting scheme outperforms the (supervised) fixed weighting scheme. Up to 50% relative error reduction is achieved by the adaptive weighting scheme.","","1-4244-0872-5","10.1109/SLT.2006.326823","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=4123368","","Vocabulary;Iterative algorithms;Induction generators;Computer science;Text processing;Information retrieval;Ontologies;Natural languages;Speech;Data mining","","10","","7","IEEE","19 Mar 2007","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

EHR records patients’ every visit by time, and there are many kinds of medical codes within a visit, therefore, EHR has characteristics of temporal irregularity and hierarchical structure. Some recent works employ BERT-style models to process EHR data for disease prediction. However, few of these models can give consideration to capture both the interaction between medical codes and the impact of temporal irregularity. To solve this problem, we propose the Double-Level BERT-style model (DL-BERT). Considering EHR’s hierarchical structure, the model contains a code-level and a visit-level representation layer which can learn the relationship between medical codes and temporal influence respectively. In the code-level representation layer, the model achieves the representation power by employing external medical ontologies to provide multi-resolution information of medical codes and the Transformer to embed medical codes. Besides, the model adopts two pre-training tasks to enhance the ability to capture the link between different kinds of codes. In the visit-level representation layer, DL-BERT utilizes a special time-aware Transformer to model temporal information. And the model adopts a visit-level pre-training task for better learning context information. Experiments are conducted on two real-world healthcare datasets and show that our model outperforms all baselines demonstrating the effectiveness of our model.","","978-1-6654-8045-1","10.1109/BigData55660.2022.10020513","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10020513","Electronic Health Record;BERT;Transformer;medical ontology;pre-train","Codes;Medical services;Ontologies;Predictive models;Big Data;Transformers;Data models","","3","","32","IEEE","26 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Contextual information is essential for word sense disambiguation, but search queries are often limited to very few keywords, making the available textual context needed for disambiguation minimal or non-existent. In this paper we propose a novel system to identify and resolve term ambiguity in search queries using large-scale user behavioral data. The proposed system demonstrates that, despite the lack of context in most keyword queries, multiple potential senses of a keyword or phrase within a search query can be accurately identified, disambiguated, and expressed in order to maximize the likelihood of fulfilling a user's information need. The proposed system overcomes the immediate lack of context by leveraging large-scale user behavioral data from historical query logs. Unlike traditional word sense disambiguation methods that rely on knowledge sources or available textual corpora, our system is language-agnostic, is able to easily handle domain-specific terms and meanings, and is automatically generated so that it does not grow out of date or require manual updating as ambiguous terms emerge or undergo a shift in meaning. The system has been implemented using the Hadoop eco-system and integrated within CareerBuilder's semantic search engine.","","978-1-4799-9926-2","10.1109/BigData.2015.7363877","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7363877","","Context;Ontologies;Search engines;Dictionaries;Java;Semantics;Context modeling","","4","","46","IEEE","28 Dec 2015","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, CML currently lacks a suitable representation for exchanging context models and instances in distributed systems. A runtime representation can be used by context-aware applications and supporting infrastructure to exchange context information and models between distributed components, and it can be used as the storage representation when relational database facilities are not present.

The task could provide informative summaries on what has happened in the real world, yield important knowledge on what are the most important events from the crowd's perspective and reveal their temporal evolutionary trends. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) has been used intensively for modeling and tracking events (or topics) in text streams. However, the event models discovered by this bottom-up approach have limitations such as a lack of semantic correspondence to real world events. Besides, they do not scale well to large datasets. This paper proposes a novel latent Dirichlet framework for event modeling and tracking. Our approach takes into account ontological knowledge on events that exist in the real world to guide the modeling and tracking processes. Therefore, event models extracted from the social web by our approach are always meaningful and semantically match with real world events. Practically, our approach requires only a single scan over the dataset to model and track events and hence scales well with dataset size.","","978-1-4244-7912-2","10.1109/ICSC.2010.75","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5629095","","Internet;Information services;Web sites;Data models;Computational modeling;Nominations and elections;Training","","2","1","10","IEEE","11 Nov 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, one-hot labels treat all sound events equally, ignoring the semantic hierarchy and proximity relationships between sound events. In contrast, the event descriptions contains richer information, describing the distance between different sound events with semantic proximity. In this paper, we explore the impact of training audio tagging models with auxiliary text descriptions of sound events. By aligning the audio features with the text features of corresponding labels, we inject the hierarchy and proximity information of sound events into audio encoders, improving the performance while making the prediction more consistent with human perception. We refer to this approach as Semantic Proximity Alignment (SPA). We use Ontology-aware mean Average Precision (OmAP) as the main evaluation metric for the models. OmAP reweights the false positives based on Audioset ontology distance and is more consistent with human perception compared to mAP. Experimental results show that the audio tagging models trained with SPA achieve higher OmAP compared to models trained with one-hot labels solely (+1.8 OmAP). Human evaluations also demonstrate that the predictions of SPA models are more consistent with human perception.","2379-190X","979-8-3503-4485-1","10.1109/ICASSP48485.2024.10446928","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10446928","Audio Classification;Sound Event Detection;Multi-modality;Audio-text Pretraining;Transformer","Training;Measurement;Semantics;Natural languages;Tagging;Signal processing;Predictive models","","","","23","IEEE","18 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Semantic Unification Meta-Model (SUMM), which is based on the classical predicate calculus, attempts to provide a foundation for specifying the semantics of a language in a way that assures the ability to translate information from one language to another. The SUMM is not intended as a primary language for modeling domain knowledge. Rather it is intended to provide a technique for rigorously defining the truth conditions of any model stated in any language that meets certain non-exclusive conditions: that the information content of the modeling language is based on the meaning of a set of “predicates” that classify objects and relationships, and on the identification of individuals through the use of “terms”. The SUMM provides a meta-model for such languages that allows the expressions of each language to be mapped to a common ontology. Such a meta-model can be developed at the instance level to support multilingual communication about particular individuals, at the model level to support multilingual communication about types of individuals, or, at the meta-model level to support multilingual communication about types of models.","","9780262291361","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=6279244.pdf&bkn=6267519&pdfType=chapter","","","","","","","","24 Sep 2012","","","MIT Press","MIT Press eBook Chapters"

Drones appeal to mission architects looking to extend the toolbox provided to operators performing challenging missions such as public safety operations. However, careful analysis of the operational context and concept of operations must take place before major acquisitions. The purpose of this paper is to propose a model-based operational architecture definition framework, which is based on the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) ontology and uses Object Process Methodology (OPM) as its underlying modeling language. Through careful mapping of DoDAF Operational Viewpoint (OV) ontology to OPM ontology, we were able to show that the entire OV ontology can be covered by a small set of objects, processes, relations among them, and constructs comprising them. We then show how to instantiate the ontology to create a model of an actual architecture of interest (AoI) while maintaining strong typing of the model elements to ensure validity, integrity, consistency, and continuous compliance with the OV. We demonstrate our approach on the case of using drones in public safety enterprises for the purpose of crowd management in massively attended events and locations. The proposed framework allows for capturing ConOps and OpsCon in a lightweight, yet robust and consistent manner, and improve communication and concept validation between operational stakeholders and enterprise architects.","1095-323X","978-1-7281-2734-7","10.1109/AERO47225.2020.9172685","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9172685","","Conferences;Imaging;Ontologies;Safety;Stakeholders;Drones","","9","","35","IEEE","21 Aug 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, known functional annotation databases usually provide positive experimental annotations that proteins carry out a given function, and rarely record negative experimental annotations that proteins do not carry out a given function. Therefore, existing computational methods based on deep learning models focus on these positive annotations for prediction and ignore these scarce but informative negative annotations, leading to an underestimation of precision. To address this issue, we introduce a deep learning method that utilizes a heterogeneous graph attention technique. The method first constructs a heterogeneous graph that covers the protein-protein interaction network, ontology structure, and positive and negative annotation information. Then, it learns embedding representations of proteins and ontology terms by using the heterogeneous graph attention technique. Finally, it leverages these learned representations to reconstruct the positive protein-term associations and score unobserved functional annotations. It can enhance the predictive performance by incorporating these known limited negative annotations into the constructed heterogeneous graph. Experimental results on three species (i.e., Human, Mouse, and Arabidopsis) demonstrate that our method can achieve better performance in predicting new protein annotations than state-of-the-art methods.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3357834","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62276043); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:DUT22ZD205); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10423114","Protein function prediction;positive and negative annotations;constructed heterogeneous graph;heterogeneous graph attention","Proteins;Protein engineering;Annotations;Feature extraction;Predictive models;Deep learning;Amino acids","Humans;Animals;Mice;Proteins;Computational Biology;Protein Interaction Maps;Molecular Sequence Annotation;Databases, Factual","6","","41","IEEE","6 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Unlike Text Classification, Document Classification works with longer sequences that typically contain multiple paragraphs. Previous approaches for this task have achieved promising results, but have often relied on complex recurrence mechanisms that are expensive and time-consuming in nature. Recently, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance on several Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tasks, but owing to the quadratic computational complexity of the self-attention mechanism with respect to the input sequence length, these approaches are generally applied to shorter text sequences. In this paper, we address this issue, by proposing a new Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder approach for the Document Classification task. The hierarchical framework we adopt helps us extend the self-attention mechanism to long-form text modelling thereby reducing the complexity considerably. We use the Bidirectional Transformer Encoder (BTE) at the sentence-level to generate a fixed-size sentence embedding for each sentence in the document. A document-level Transformer Encoder is then used to model the global document context and learn the inter-sentence dependencies. We also carry out experiments with the BTE in a feature-extraction and a fine-tuning setup, allowing us to evaluate the trade-off between computation power and accuracy. Furthermore, we also conduct ablation experiments, and evaluate the impact of different pre-training strategies on the overall performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance on two standard benchmark datasets.","2375-9259","978-1-6654-2427-1","10.1109/ICDMW53433.2021.00109","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9679873","Transformer;Self-attention;Document Classification","Training;Sentiment analysis;Computational modeling;Transfer learning;Text categorization;Natural languages;Ontologies","","2","","40","IEEE","20 Jan 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this current study, we propose a system capable of presenting the reason and justification for the detected domestic hazardous behaviors. Our system will first generates the reason for the detected behavior using a Large Language Model (LLM). To ensure the accuracy, reliability and reproducibility of the LLM output, the system will provides reliable sources to support the output. We employed Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to search for sentences similar to the reason generated by the LLM within reliable, authoritative documents describing domestic accident cases and their causes and these will be presented as the evidence alongside the search engine results to the users. Consequently, a knowledge graph (KG) of domestic hazardous behavior is developed based on evidence ontology. Finally, to evaluate the ability of our proposed system in appropriately generating reasons for domestic hazardous behaviors and the adequacy of the justifications provided, the output was rated using LLMs and human volunteers. The rating results showed a significant correlation between LLMs and human evaluation, indicating that the proposed system can provide sufficient reasons and justifications for domestic hazardous behaviors at residential setting.","2379-1896","979-8-3315-2836-2","10.1109/CANDAR64496.2024.00010","Technology Development; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10818303","Retrieval-Augmented Generation;Large Language Model;Explainable AI;Knowledge Graph","Correlation;Retrieval augmented generation;Knowledge graphs;Search engines;Ontologies;Reproducibility of results;Behavioral sciences;Sensors;Optimization;Accidents","","","","25","IEEE","31 Dec 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The first metric computes ""wide-context"" similarity between words using a ""bag-of-words"" model, while the second metric computes ""narrow-context"" similarity using a bigram language model. A hybrid metric that is defined as the linear combination of the wide and narrow-context metrics is also proposed and evaluated. To cluster words into semantic classes an iterative clustering algorithm is used. The semantic metrics are evaluated on two corpora: a semantically heterogeneous Web news domain (HR-Net) and an application-specific travel reservation corpus (ATIS).

There are large projects going on in many industries that collaborate between robots and other robots, as well as humans and robots. In hospital environments, care for people with medical needs and their needs and used to make appropriate suggestions to their problems. Robots can also be found in certain areas that can respond quickly as an emergency rescue agent. Furthermore, robots, which can be seen in the hotel industry as waiters and as farm assistants in agriculture, have a great tendency to be used as multi-tasking agents in many fields. In each of these areas, robots must co-operate with humans. In that situation, the importance of the exchange of mutual knowledge between robots-robots and between humans-robots comes into the picture. What matters here is not only the quantitative vastness of knowledge but also the ability to understand each other in the same medium. Although the common sense that people need in their day-to-day work is completely obvious to humans, the commonsense knowledge domain needs to be implanted in robots. Whatever concept is defined for adding commonsense to robotics, it should be a consistent concept that can be logically constructed so that it can be understood by a machine. As will be discussed later in the paper, different methods have been used in various related works to add a different kind of domain knowledge to robotics. The objective of this paper is to provide an improved retrained model for robotics in order to give them the ability to act more human-like when performing tasks. By using the proposed model robots are able to answer the incomplete command or inquiries related to a given context. One of the objectives of this work is to use the ontology-based, commonsense-support existing knowledge base as a mechanism to retrain and build a new model.","2613-8662","978-1-6654-7375-0","10.1109/SCSE56529.2022.9905090","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9905090","BERT;commonsense;robotics;transfer learning","Training;Adaptation models;Service robots;Knowledge based systems;Robot sensing systems;Hardware;Sensors","","4","","30","IEEE","4 Oct 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Voice, text, and pictures affect knowledge transmission. Techniques for interpolating data may retain knowledge by determining semantic equivalents based on its context, the lesson, and connections without sacrificing data integrity. Knowledge has affected the security and privacy of data, showing vulnerability on every side of privacy and security violations with numerous legislation and standards. linguistic models convert voice impulses to digital data to examine phonological, prosodic, phonotactic, and lexical features. In contrast, embedding text in pictures and voice patterns modify word meaning via resolution, simplicity, and pitch adjustment. NLP uses vectors to detect word similarity, ensuring anonymity for ontology-based understanding with compatibility while deciphering control features. Using text-based semantic similarities analysis, visual text is classed by arrangement and topic. Every individual's linguistic dialect is distinct, with a tendency toward the local dialect. Due of rapid modifications to the environment, methods' acoustic qualities are difficult to transmit. Voice translating syllables might or might not communicate word feeling according to phonetical modification. A learnt variables taxonomy with prosody properties helps knowledge bases find relevant material without intermediary stages. For successful information transmission, integration, and edge manufacturing, edge learning requires context. An ontology of learnt connections from text, speech, and pictures shows information resemblance usefulness, and interest.

We select the highest-scoring clusters and use their medoid nodes for the next iteration of clustering, until we obtain a hierarchical and informative representation of the protein.

Describing and constructing structured and comparable BMs capturing concrete business cases is hampered. Even the success of the most prominent BMR approach - the business model canvas (BMC) - could only lead to slight advances. So, we aim to mature research on BMRs by enhancing the BMC with further conceptual modeling's concepts. We will focus on Health Information Technology (HIT) initiatives that are prone to fail. Analyses showed that the domain's networked nature of value creation requires to link and interrelate the BM's building blocks. Current BMR approaches, including the BMC, can only hardly provide such. For addressing BMC's conceptual weaknesses, we propose to substantiate the BMC by means of a layered concept making use of conceptual modeling's principles and considering the domain's specifics to a greater extent. Systematic and HITspecific BM(R) approaches are worthwhile as these identify and map all relevant stakeholders as well as their interrelations for value creation. That is a primary prerequisite for sustainable HIT solutions. So, we aim at bringing necessary complex information into a structured concept that allows to make profound managerial decisions.

Moreover, while malicious attacks remain a significant problem, the majority of user-caused information leaks in Enterprise Systems are unintentional (or have many unintentional components) and could potentially be prohibited if explicitly recognized and appropriately modeled. In this paper we argue that approaches for achieving information flow security in enterprises need to combine process and policy understandability with usability of the enforcement mechanisms. We present a modeling approach that allows security policies to be formulated in such a way that (1) they are aligned to the business processes executed in an enterprise, (2) are understandable by all relevant stakeholders, and (3) can be semi-automatically transformed into run-time enforcement mechanisms.","2325-6605","978-1-4673-5005-1","10.1109/EDOCW.2012.12","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6406247","Information security;User Behaviour;Security Property","Humans;Companies;Interviews;Information security","","","","33","IEEE","10 Jan 2013","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, due to the rising trend in the explainability and fairness of AI models, frameworks like Model Cards, Service Cards and Data Cards have emerged to facilitate understanding and reusing those models and datasets. Moreover, the Dataspace concept integrates these resources into Dataspace Cards, a comprehensive framework that systematically captures and organises crucial information to guide model and data selection for a specific application. This paper advocates a Semantic Web approach for transforming Model/Data Cards into Linked Data or knowledge graphs within a Dataspace, rendering them machine-readable and interoperable. A significant contribution is the development of a vocabulary that unifies Data, Model and Dataspace Card ontologies, enhancing consistent documentation and understanding of the Dataspace design. The paper further demonstrates the applicability of the proposed schema in various use cases, including bias detection in BERT-base-uncased and Large Language Models. Additionally, we propose a conceptual semantic approach, examined in-depth for sentiment and emotion analysis, to highlight how extended Dataspace Cards can improve applicability and outcomes. We found that this unified, ontology-driven approach results in more consistent metadata linking and more fine-grained bias detection in BERT-based-uncased than standalone documentation tools relying solely on Model or Data Cards. Furthermore, compared to existing frameworks, the richer interlinking capabilities of our proposed Dataspace Cards also facilitated easier traceability of performance outcomes, thereby ultimately fostering higher trustworthiness and reusability of AI resources.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3572211","Research Ireland(grant numbers:12/RC/2289_P2); Insight Research Ireland Centre for Data Analytics(grant numbers:20/SP/8955); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11008609","Semantic web;AI documentation;data cards;model cards;service cards;dataspace cards","Data models;Artificial intelligence;Documentation;Semantics;Adaptation models;Linked data;Europe;Training;Semantic Web;Vocabulary","","","","58","CCBY","21 May 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Replying to a free-form factual question based on a large collection of text is challenging. Previous research has shown that the accuracy of question answering systems can be improved by adding a classification phase based on the expected answer type. This paper focuses on implementing a multi-level, multi-class question classification system focusing on the travel domain. Existing research for the travel domain is conducted using language-specific features and traditional Machine Learning models. In contrast, this research employs transformer-based state-of-the-art deep contextualized word embedding models for question classification.

Each data expert is trained on one data cluster, being less sensitive to false negative noises in other clusters. At inference time, we ensemble their outputs by applying weights determined through the correlation between task metadata and cluster conditions. To estimate the correlation pre-cisely, the samples in one cluster should be semantically similar, but the number of data experts should still be rea-sonable for training and inference. As such, we consider the ontology in human language and propose to use fine- grained cluster centers to represent each data expert at a coarse-grained level. Experimental studies show that four CLIP data experts on ViT-B/16 outperform the ViT-L/14 by OpenAI CLIP and OpenCLIP on zero-shot image classification but with less (<35%) training cost.

To this end, this study proposes a heterogeneous network-based deep learning framework (termed deepDGA) to predict disease-gene associations. First, a heterogeneous network with four kinds of biological nodes and eight kinds of edges is constructed. Second, we develop a meta path-driven deep Transformer encoder to learn node representations which contains semantic characteristics of nodes in the heterogeneous network. Finally, the inductive matrix completion algorithm that can solve problem of cold-start, is used for disease-gene association prediction. The results of 5-flod cross-validation and top-ranked predictions suggest that deepDGA is superior to other methods. In addition, we further observe that deepDGA performs the highest predictive ability for specific diseases via the literature verification, KEGG human pathway analyses, and GO enrichment analyses.

The required levels of autonomy, openness, and self-adaptation, as well as the dynamic nature of the context of such CPS, result in challenging tasks for their engineering. During operation, unexpected situations in which the system has insufficient knowledge about the current state of the system itself as well as its context may occur. Engineering CPS, e.g., for industrial production sites, must account for such uncertainties the system will have to cope with during its lifetime in a structured and systematic way. Since the development of CPS requires consideration of different system perspectives, current uncertainty modeling approaches cannot be applied right away, as they do not explicitly consider uncertainty aspects that affect different artifacts. To aid the engineering of CPS, this article presents a model-based approach to document uncertainty. We propose “Orthogonal Uncertainty Models,” which closely integrate with other engineering artifacts from different perspectives, as a means for capturing a dedicated uncertainty viewpoint. Our approach has been evaluated in the industry automation domain. The application shows that the idea of regarding uncertainty within a dedicated perspective is highly beneficial. Particularly, our approach helps to uncover and document uncertainties related to behavioral, functional, and structural properties of a system, as well as uncertainties related to business models that would otherwise possibly remain covert. Note to Practitioners-Identifying and documenting uncertainties, which may occur during operation of a system, is a common problem in engineering processes. Such uncertainties may lead to severe damage, and thus need to be mitigated appropriately. It is crucial to account for these uncertainties during engineering, especially in the early phases. Depending on the specific project characteristics, a multitude of different diagram types are used to model a system. Uncertainties thus reflect in many artifacts, which leads to: 1) redundancies in the specified uncertainty attached to diagram elements and 2) uncertainty information (e.g., about the cause or effect of uncertainty) that is spread across different diagrams. The latter makes it difficult to structure uncertainty information and trace it throughout the engineering process so that uncertainty can be systematically considered. Our approach provides a graphical modeling language that employs a dedicated perspective on uncertainty in separate diagrams that can be linked to any engineering artifact.","1558-3783","","10.1109/TASE.2020.2980726","German Federal Ministry of Education and Research(grant numbers:01IS16043Q,01IS16043V); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9050669","Cyber-physical systems;industry automation case study;model-based engineering;orthogonal modeling;uncertainty;uncertainty modeling","Uncertainty;Robot sensing systems;Context modeling;Collaboration;Production;Runtime","","16","","62","IEEE","30 Mar 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

As a result, the construction process of enterprise models requires the creation of drafts of models allowing modelers to create an initial draft and to refine it when new and correct enterprise information is obtained. One draft of one enterprise model is a temporal model, which can include incomplete or imperfect elements. Drafts can include supporting data, which is additional data regarding the sources observed.

While activities are often not considered at all or not treated in a conceptually satisfactory way in the discrete event simulation literature, the great majority of business process modeling languages are based on an activity construct. However, unlike a simulation language, the predominant business process modeling languages, including UML Activity Diagrams and the Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN), are not executable. So, the challenge for business process modeling is to define an executable semantics for activities, while the challenge for discrete event simulation is to find a way how to introduce an activity construct on top of the basic discrete event simulation concepts of objects and events. The main idea is to define an activity as a complex event having a start event and an end event. This idea is well-known from the business process modeling literature, e.g. from the Business Process Definition Metamodel (Bock 2008), but it has also been used in a rudimentary way in some discrete event simulation approaches, e.g. in (Fishman 2001). Our research contribution consists of two achievements: 1) we define a conceptual model of activities for discrete event simulation and implement it in our ER/AOR simulation language; 2) we show how to use BPMN for the purpose of simulation modeling.","1558-4305","978-1-4244-5771-7","10.1109/WSC.2009.5429231","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5429231","","Discrete event simulation;Erbium;Delay;Unified modeling language;Logic;Artificial intelligence;Informatics;Ontologies;Terminology","","14","","7","IEEE","11 Mar 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

In this paper, an ontology model based on the software testing process is applied to establish a software testing knowledge graph, which serves as the foundation to build an recommendation system. Specifically, the recommendation system takes the functions of software under test as the “user”, and the defect-occurrence-chain which establishes the correlation between test cases and defects in the knowledge graph as the “item”. Both of them provide the evidence to build collaborative filtering recommendation algorithm based on the user-item scoring matrix. It aims to assist testers in recommending reusable test cases to identify software errors effectively. Against this background, the BERT+Bi-LSTM-CRF model is selected to extract the latent test requirements of the software under test, and an overt variable factorization model is built so as to iteratively optimize the user-item scoring matrix. Further, an empirical study has been conducted, and it is found that the recommended test cases can significantly help testers find software defects faster in a more efficient way, and locate defects more accurately.","2693-9371","978-1-6654-7836-6","10.1109/QRS-C55045.2021.00020","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9742010","software testing knowledge graph;collaborative filtering;BERT+Bi-LSTM-CRF;defect-occurrence-chain;overt variable factorization model","Software testing;Collaborative filtering;Software algorithms;Semantics;Software quality;Ontologies;Software","","2","","43","IEEE","1 Apr 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

It serves as an essential resource for both clinical practice and medical research. Approximately 40% of these relationships are of the is-a type, which is key to classifying concepts as subtypes or subclasses within broader categories and is fundamental for decision support systems and automated reasoning in clinical environments. Identifying is-a relationships in SNOMED CT is crucial for enhancing the accuracy of patient cohort queries, which form the backbone of clinical and research applications. Our study aims to use deep learning-based neural networks to determine whether a relationship between two concepts falls under the is-a or non-is-a categories. This approach can help detect misclassified or undefined is-a concept pairs, ultimately improving the quality of SNOMED CT ontology. We construct a node-edge-node structure for concept pairs and their relationships, which we then split into two categories: is-a and non-is-a classes. In this study, we propose two classification approaches. In the first approach using embeddingBag, the data are mapped into vector representations and used as input for a fully connected neural network to learn the patterns of the is-a relationship. During model training, 80% of the data is used for training and the remaining 20% for testing.We achieved a precision of 0.903, recall of 0.894, and F1 Score of 0.898 in predicting the is-a relation among the associated medical concepts. The second approach involved transformer-based models like BERT(Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Devlin et al. [1], which dramatically advanced various natural language processing (NLP) tasks by offering deeply contextualized word embeddings. And RoBERTa(Robustly optimized BERT approach)[2], both BERT and RoBERTa models have significantly advanced the field of NLP. This work uses them as encoders connected to a classifier head to predict is-a or non-is-a categories. We fine-tune our models using a historical SNOMED CT dataset from 2017, while evaluation is carried out on new data introduced after 2023 in the 2024 release. With a recall of 0.933, precision of 0.933, F1 score of 0.932, accuracy of 0.933, and ROC of 0.972, RoBERTa outperforms the other baseline models (Support Vector Machine(SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN), Naive Bayes, and Multilayer Perceptron(MLP)) across all metrics.

To address these challenges, we propose a pluggable common sense-enhanced KGC framework that incorporates both fact and common sense for KGC. This framework is adaptable to different KGs based on their entity concept richness and has the capability to automatically generate explicit or implicit common sense from factual triples. Furthermore, we introduce common senseguided negative sampling and a coarse-to-fine inference approach for KGs with rich entity concepts. For KGs without concepts, we propose a dual scoring scheme involving a relation-aware concept embedding mechanism. Importantly, our approach can be integrated as a pluggable module for many knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models, facilitating joint common sense and fact-driven training and inference.

Generally developed approaches are presented, which were implemented in a commercially developed agent framework and validated on the basis of an industrial use case for a product-led filling process in lot size one. All implemented concepts aim to be reusable in comparable applications across industries. In combination with the MAS-internal testing approach also presented, this should contribute to faster, more cost-effective implementation of reliable MAS solutions and ultimately increase their technical maturity.","2687-9743","","10.1109/JESTIE.2021.3117121","Bayerische Forschungsstiftung(grant numbers:AZ-1130-14); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9556591","Industrial agents (IAs);cyber–physical product ion system (CPPS);multiagent system (MAS)","Production systems;Production control;XML;Radiofrequency identification;Costs;Companies;Testing","","","","24","CCBY","1 Oct 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The second downloads a number of the top ranked documents and applies ""widecontext"" and ""narrow-context"" metrics. The proposed metrics work automatically, without consulting any human annotated knowledge resource. The metrics are compared with WordNet-based methods.

We have developed novel parallel heuristics to extract terms from the original collection (alongside metadata), which provides a mix of unstructured and semi-structured input data, and populated a new knowledge graph with this information. Our Natural Language Processing models enable frances to perform advanced analyses that go significantly beyond simple search using the information stored in the knowledge graph. Furthermore, frances also allows for creating and running complex text mining analyses at scale.

An essential problem in food computing is the adaptation of recipes to user needs and preferences. The main difficulty when adapting recipes is in determining ingredients relations, which are compound and hard to interpret. Word embedding models can catch the semantics of food items in a recipe, helping to understand how ingredients are combined and substituted. In this work, we propose an unsupervised method for adapting ingredient recipes to user preferences. To learn food representations and relations, we create and apply a specific-domain word embedding model. In contrast to previous works, we not only use the list of ingredients to train the model but also the cooking instructions. We enrich the ingredient data by mapping them to a nutrition database to guide the adaptation and find ingredient substitutes. We performed three different kinds of recipe adaptation based on nutrition preferences, adapting to similar ingredients, and vegetarian and vegan diet restrictions. With a 95% of confidence, our method can obtain quality adapted recipes without a previous knowledge extraction on the recipe adaptation domain. Our results confirm the potential of using a specific-domain semantic model to tackle the recipe adaptation task.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3058559","European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation program(grant numbers:816303 (Stance4Health)); University of Granada through a program of research initiation for master’s degree students; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9351987","Data mapping;food computing;natural language processing;recipe adaptation;word embedding","Adaptation models;Task analysis;Ontologies;Databases;Computational modeling;Data models;Vocabulary","","24","","43","CCBY","10 Feb 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many works have modeled the mashup creation problem as a service recommendation task and have achieved remarkable results. However, the performance of these methods can be further improved. The main problems affecting these methods include the constraints among recommended services, the evolution of services, and the semantic gap existing in services and mashups. In this article, we model the mashup creation problem as a service bundle recommendation task that is formally defined to address the constraints among recommended services. And then, a dynamic graph neural network based model called DySR is proposed to tackle the evolution of service and the semantic gap between services and mashups. In order to quantitatively measure how significant the semantic gap between mashups and services is, a measurement method of a semantic gap is given. With it, experiments show that to what extent DySR can reduce the semantic gap in the context of mashup creation. In addition, new evaluation metrics are introduced to overcome the preference for popular services in traditional service recommendations. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-world dataset from ProgrammableWeb, and the experiment results show that DySR outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.","1939-1374","","10.1109/TSC.2023.3234293","National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2021YFB3300700); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61832004,61832014); Key Research and Development Program of Heilongjiang Province(grant numbers:2022ZX01A11); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10016758","Dynamic graph neural networks;evolving service;mashup creation;semantic gap;service bundle recommendation","Mashups;Semantics;Task analysis;Graph neural networks;Computational modeling;Quality of service;Ontologies","","22","","56","IEEE","13 Jan 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To address these challenges, we propose a Multimodal Attention-based fusIon Networks (MAIN) for diagnosis prediction. In this model, we first design different feature extraction modules for each modality. Then, an inter-modal correlation module which contains two layers is applied to capture the intermodal correlation. Finally, a multimodal fusion module based on weighted averaging is utilized to integrate the representations derived from different modalities and their correlation to obtain the patient representation for diagnosis prediction.

In this paper we examine misuse cases in the light of a reference model for information system security risk management (ISSRM).

Here the basic problems are to find R&D's results and/or teams for solving the professional tasks and for making investment. But business has no personal view on scientific problems. So business is seeking the objective tools for forecasting and evaluation of R&D prospects and results. Experts have own interests and require a lot of funding. R&D reflections are the texts. The modern methods of computer analysis of texts can do a lot of the experts' work for making it more objective and cheaper. The tools for search, systematization and ranking R&D's results and teams are computer analysis of texts and the map of science. The map of science is the distribution of the collection of texts of a scientific nature by the topics. The map of science is a way to navigate through the world of scientific publications and R&D's teams, a tool for identifying trends and assessing R&D directions. The usual ways for the map of science formation use bibliometric/scientometric data, general probability models of the texts, expert's opinion or artificial intelligence (AI) models and methods based on the thesaurus or on the ontology of the subject domains. The interests of business are not in line with the orientation on a priori established ideas about possible topics or there number for rapidly changing scientific fields. Precisely these fields are of the greatest interest to business. On the basis of mathematical modeling of texts and large-scale text collections, an approach is proposed for the computational formation of the adaptive dynamic map of science that does not use a priori classification schemes and data of the scientific publications' citation. Topics (thematic groups), their number and the distribution of texts over the topics are determined computationally without experts' involvement. Examples of the maps of science for various collections of scientific publications are given. The original method is proposed for checking the adequacy of the text models and the map of science. The method uses the categorization of articles and their abstracts as the separate objects on the basis of computationally generated map (its topics). The results of the large-scale experiment confirmed the high efficiency of the proposed mathematical modeling of texts and text collections. The possibilities of practical use of the map of science for business applications are considered.","2378-1971","978-1-7281-0650-2","10.1109/CBI.2019.00058","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8808078","text;collection;semantics;semiotics;modeling;interpretation;research and development;information retrieval;analytical support","Research and development;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Business;Semantics;Tools;Adaptation models","","","","21","IEEE","22 Aug 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

While this demonstrated potential promise, it fell short in several aspects of providing a useful human-robot interaction system. The current research addresses three of these shortcomings, demonstrating the natural extensibility of the platform architecture. First, the system must be able not only to understand what it hears, but also to describe what it sees and to interact with the human user. This is a natural extension of the knowledge of sentence-to-meaning mappings that is now applied in the inverse scene-to-sentence sense. Secondly, we extend the system's ontology from physical events to include spatial relations. We show that spatial relations are naturally accommodated in the predicate argument representations for events.

A key role is played by Semantic Interoperability (SI) which enables seamless data exchange between diverse care settings and clinical software. SI necessitates the linking of bio-medical data (aka. clinical events) with shared, standardized, and controlled vocabularies like SNOMED, LOINC, etc. However, the healthcare data across various client domains are filled with ambiguous textual representations of clinical events that may be present in the form of synonyms, acronyms, and abbreviations. To make interoperability work, Healthcare IT service providers must map related clinical events with the appropriate standard concepts, which requires additional time and resources. Natural Language Processing (NLP) plays a vital role in addressing the challenges of SI by learning effective representations of text words in the bio-medical domain thereby capturing their semantic meaning. Our method utilizes various pre-trained word embeddings trained on the bio-medical corpus like BioWordVec fastText and SapBERT that captures fine-grained semantic relationships. In this study, we have developed a recommendation system that provides recommendations of Top ‘N’ clinical events for mapping to a standard concept. The recommendation system showed good performance with a sensitivity of above 99 % using both the pre-trained word embedding.

For businesses with street side locations one can leverage the abundance of street level imagery, such as Google Street View, to automate the process. However, while data is abundant, labeled data is not; the limiting factor is creation of large scale labeled training data.

Nevertheless, experimental determination of PPI can be both time-consuming and expensive, motivating the exploration of data-driven deep learning technologies as a viable, efficient, and accurate alternative. Nonetheless, most current deep learning-based methods regarded a pair of proteins to be predicted for possible interaction as two separate entities when extracting PPI features, thus neglecting the knowledge sharing among the collaborative protein and the target protein. Aiming at the above issue, a collaborative learning framework CollaPPI was proposed in this study, where two kinds of collaboration, i.e., protein-level collaboration and task-level collaboration, were incorporated to achieve not only the knowledge-sharing between a pair of proteins, but also the complementation of such shared knowledge between biological domains closely related to PPI (i.e., protein function, and subcellular location). Evaluation results demonstrated that CollaPPI obtained superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on two PPI benchmarks. Besides, evaluation results of CollaPPI on the additional PPI type prediction task further proved its excellent generalization ability.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3375621","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62306293); Natural Science Foundation of Qingdao(grant numbers:23-2-1-115-zyyd-jch); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities(grant numbers:202313034); Shandong Provincial Postdoctoral Program for Innovative Talents(grant numbers:SDBX2020003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10465250","Graph neural network;multi-task learning;protein-protein interaction;protein representation learning","Proteins;Collaboration;Task analysis;Feature extraction;Protein engineering;Deep learning;Vectors","Protein Interaction Mapping;Computational Biology;Deep Learning;Proteins;Humans;Databases, Protein;Algorithms","8","","52","IEEE","11 Mar 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Industries suffer due to supply chain disruptions caused by anomalies, which are being detected by current AI models but leaving domain experts uncertain without deeper insights into these anomalies. Additionally, operational inefficiencies persist due to inaccurate production forecasts and the limited effectiveness of traditional AI models for processing complex sensor data. Despite these advancements, existing systems lack the seamless integration of these capabilities needed to create a truly unified solution for enhancing production and decision-making.

Despite increased attention to this issue, most approaches in trajectory prediction do not consider all of these factors sufficiently. We present SemanticFormer, an approach for predicting multimodal trajectories by reasoning over a semantic traffic scene graph using a hybrid approach. It utilizes high-level information in the form of meta-paths, i.e. trajectories on which an agent is allowed to drive from a knowledge graph which is then processed by a novel pipeline based on multiple attention mechanisms to predict accurate trajectories. SemanticFormer comprises a hierarchical heterogeneous graph encoder to capture spatio-temporal and relational information across agents as well as between agents and road elements. Further, it includes a predictor to fuse different encodings and decode trajectories with probabilities. Finally, a refinement module assesses permitted meta-paths of trajectories and speed profiles to obtain final predicted trajectories. Evaluation of the nuScenes benchmark demonstrates improved performance compared to several SOTA methods. In addition, we demonstrate that our knowledge graph can be easily added to two graph-based existing SOTA methods, namely VectorNet and LaFormer, replacing their original homogeneous graphs. The evaluation results suggest that by adding our knowledge graph the performance of the original methods is enhanced by 5% and 4%, respectively.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2024.3426386","Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10592819","Semantic scene understanding;autonomous agents;intelligent transportation systems","Trajectory;Knowledge graphs;Semantics;Ontologies;Encoding;Predictive models;Transformers","","7","","67","IEEE","10 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In a nutshell, semantic search is ""search with meaning"". This ""meaning"" can refer to various parts of the search process: understanding the query (instead of just finding matches of its components in the data), understanding the data (instead of just searching it for such matches), or representing knowledge in a way suitable for meaningful retrieval. Semantic search is studied in a variety of different communities with a variety of different views of the problem. Semantic Search on Text and Knowledge Bases classifies this work according to two dimensions: the type of data (text, knowledge bases, combinations of these) and the kind of search (keyword, structured, natural language). All nine combinations are considered. The focus is on fundamental techniques, concrete systems, and benchmarks. The monograph also considers advanced issues: ranking, indexing, ontology matching and merging, and inference. It also provides a succinct overview of fundamental natural language processing techniques: POS-tagging, named-entity recognition and disambiguation, sentence parsing, and distributional semantics. Semantic Search on Text and Knowledge Bases is as self-contained as possible, and should thus also serve as a good tutorial for newcomers to this fascinating and highly topical field.","","9781680831658","","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/ebooks/bookPdfWithBanner.jsp?fileName=8187206.pdf&bkn=8187206&pdfType=book","Indexing and retrieval of structured documents;Information extraction;Natural language processing for IR;Question Answering;Text Mining;Semantic Web","","","","","","","15 Dec 2017","","","now","Now Foundations and Trends Books"

Rubin","SPAWAR Systems Center, San Diego, CA, USA",Proceedings Fifth IEEE Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications,"8 Jan 2004","2003","","","150","159","Progress in AI (artificial intelligence) is bottlenecked by contemporary thinking. Soft computing methodologies recognize the fundamental role of imprecision in any computational intelligence. This paper goes one step further in that it recognizes the fundamental need for heuristics - both as a generalization of numeric imprecision according to S.H. Rubin (1999) and, as a consequence, of Godel's Incompleteness Theorem by V.A. Uspenskii (1987). Heuristic ontologies were compared with logical ontologies and shown to be advantageous for the realization of intelligent computation. It was also noted how the mechanics of evolutionary biology and that presupposed for thought can be computationally equivalent. In particular, randomness and symmetry by G.J. Chaitin (1975) are shown to underpin computational evolution by providing for heuristic discovery, knowledge transference and creative computation. The capability for the transference of heuristic knowledge was evidenced to be fundamental to the evolution of what M. Minsky (1987) has termed, ""a society of mind"". The need for transformational representations of this knowledge was demonstrated by S. Amarel (1968). A modeling language, designed to exploit domain symmetries, was characterized for the game of Tic-Tac-Toe. Applications to UAVs and intelligent agents - among a plethora of others - will follow. In conclusion, Marvin Minsky argues that many AI researchers seem to have lost their way in recent years and should be investigating core problems such as how a person reasons according to C.T. Clark. It is hoped that this paper will sow the seeds for a proper response to Minsky's admonition by inciting a restoration in the type of creative thinking that attracted many AI researchers into the field in the first place.","","0-7803-8242-0","10.1109/IRI.2003.1251408","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=1251408","","Reflection;Working environment noise;Humans;Vehicles;Object oriented modeling;Cost function;Neural networks;Operational amplifiers;Ontologies;USA Councils","","","","27","IEEE","8 Jan 2004","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The method of acquisition, representation, storage, exchange, sharing, transformation, and re-use of knowledge among the heterogeneous enterprises should be thoroughly discussed prior to linking the enterprises through the network. In order to solve these problems, a strategic project has been started in Japan from the participations from both industries and academics. It is the VIPNET (Virtual Production Enterprise Network) project under the novel IMS (Intelligent Manufacturing System) program. This strategic project aims at linking the virtual production enterprises through a network, where all enterprises can exchange and share the knowledge with the help of the appropriate network infrastructure. In this project, we are focusing on establishing the technological information infrastructure. This infrastructure is expected to support the life cycle activities of the production enterprises, such as the research and development, process design, production, distribution, marketing, sales, maintenance, and even the disposal of any production plant. The main topics included in this project are information modeling technology, flexible hardware or software, data warehousing technology, intelligent agent technology, ontology technology, and so on.

Based upon abstract syntax described using metamodels and a set of profiles, concept reusability is established for the specific domain. Additionally a reusable modeling framework is developed with tailored design patterns and multiple viewpoints. Analysis metamodel, profile and interface are further presented to preserve reusability during iterations among multiple optimization rounds. A novel satellite network simulation model is formulated and multi-objective optimization is solved by transformation under practical application scenarios. A set of metrics are designed to assess and validate the models. Results show that the proposed reusable model has viewpoint coverage of more than 80 percent compared to a half for the baseline OOSEM model.

Custom focuses on right-sized, domain-specific data and workflows; Compact emphasizes resource-conscious models that can run on edge or mobile hardware; Composite unifies neural, symbolic and feedback modules for end-to-end reasoning. Three pilot systems illustrate the paradigm: Nourich (diabetes-aware dietary guidance) outperforms nine LLM baselines on recipe suitability; MAIC (K–12 mental-health triage) matches PHQ-9 gold-standard accuracy while halving compute; and SmartPilot (edge manufacturing copilot) achieves 93% anomaly accuracy and 21% forecasting gain over LSTM baselines.

In many cases, the simulation logics which are developed by different teams with specific expertise, need to be integrated to build a complete simulation system. Thus, supporting composability and reusability of simulation functionalities with minimal integration and performance overhead is a challenging but required capability. Middleware for game engines are promising to realize both the modular and reusable development criteria as well as the high performance requirements, while data-centric publish/subscribe middleware can support seamless integration and synchronization of the distributed artifacts. However, differences in the level of abstraction at which these middleware operate and the semantic differences in their underlying ontologies make it hard and challenging for simulation application developers and system integrators to realize a complete, operational system. To that end this paper presents a model-driven approach to blending the two middleware, wherein the modeling capabilities provide intuitive and higher-level abstractions for developers to reason about the composition and validation of the complete system, and the generative capabilities address the inherent and accidental complexities incurred in reconciling the semantic differences between the gaming and pub/sub middleware.

Based on the actor model, it supports fine grained concurrency and parallelism. The architecture uses actors to realize a distributed application state and execution model which is mapped to an object-centered global and coherent world view based on entities. The architecture pays specific attention to the minimize coupling and maximize cohesion software engineering principle. Entities are associated with specific properties. These properties are realized by so called state variables. State variable access is implicitly relayed to individual actors guarding access to them. The underlying asynchronous event mechanism is based on the actors' message passing facility to provide intra- and interprocess communication. It supports typical read/write access as well as change notification and snapshot services. An extensible world interface uses a semantic annotation layer grounded into an ontology to provide a coherent world view of the distributed world state and execution model. The world interface greatly simplifies configurability and the semantic layer provides a solid foundation for incorporation of different Artificial Intelligence components. The system is implemented in Scala using the Java virtual machine. This choice additionally fosters low-level scalability, portability, and reusability.

Subgraph reasoning with message passing is a promising and popular solution. Some recent methods have achieved good performance, but they (i) usually can only predict triples involving unseen entities alone, failing to address more realistic fully inductive situations with both unseen entities and unseen relations, and (ii) often conduct message passing over the entities with the relation patterns not fully utilized. In this study, we propose a new method named RMPI which uses a novel Relational Message Passing network for fully Inductive KGC. It passes messages directly between relations to make full use of the relation patterns for subgraph reasoning with new techniques on graph transformation, graph pruning, relation-aware neighborhood attention, addressing empty subgraphs, etc., and can utilize the relation semantics defined in the KG’s ontological schema. Extensive evaluation on multiple benchmarks has shown the effectiveness of RMPI’s techniques and its better performance compared with the existing methods that support fully inductive KGC.

Our empirical studies show that current work has a low level of robustness to long-tail entities and the lack of entity names or relation triples. We aim to develop a robust and adaptive entity alignment method, and the availability of relations, attributes, or names is not required. Our method consists of an attribute encoder and a relation encoder, representing an entity by aggregating its attributes or relational neighbors using the attention mechanisms that can highlight the useful attributes and relations in end-to-end learning. To let the encoders complement each other and produce a coherent representation space, we propose adaptive embedding fusion via a gating mechanism. We consider four evaluation settings, i.e., the conventional setting with both relation and attribute triples, as well as three challenging settings without attributes, without relations, without both relations and names, respectively. Results show that our method can achieve state-of-the-art performance.

It is found that two views of knowledge (i.e., a fact view based on the fact triple and a context view based on the fact triple's source context) provide complementary information that is vital to the task of OKB canonicalization, which clusters synonymous noun phrases and relation phrases into the same group and assigns them unique identifiers.

We first show that generative topic model can be used to model the taxon abundance information obtained by homology-based approach and study the microbial core. The model considers each sample as a ""document,” which has a mixture of functional groups, while each functional group (also known as a ""latent topic”) is a weight mixture of species. Therefore, estimating the generative topic model for taxon abundance data will uncover the distribution over latent functions (latent topic) in each sample. Second, we show that, generative topic model can also be used to study the genome-level composition of ""N-mer” features (DNA subreads obtained by composition-based approaches). The model consider each genome as a mixture of latten genetic patterns (latent topics), while each functional pattern is a weighted mixture of the ""N-mer” features, thus the existence of core genomes can be indicated by a set of common N-mer features. After studying the mutual information between latent topics and gene regions, we provide an explanation of the functional roles of uncovered latten genetic patterns.

They only have to specify the rough process flow graphically in terms of ontologically defined `semantic' entities. These loose specifications are then concretized to fully executable process code automatically by means of a combination of 1) data-flow analysis, ensuring the availability of the required resources, 2) temporal logic-based process synthesis, resolving type conflicts and taking care of correct component instantiation, and 3) model checking, to ensure global intents and invariants expressed in temporal logic.","","978-1-4244-8539-0","10.1109/QUATIC.2010.53","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5655574","synthesis;data-flow analysis;model checking;loose specification","Programming;Taxonomy;Concrete;Analytical models;Semantics;Software;Classification algorithms","","48","","25","IEEE","3 Dec 2010","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

A previous analysis of the use of this construct within ArchiMate's business layer concluded that it fails to represent some important social aspects associated with the dynamics of service relations, which led to recommendations for improvements in the form of modeling patterns with focus on the business layer of ArchiMate. In this paper, we extend that analysis to consider also service relations in the application and technology layers. We explore the importance of addressing two complementary views for service modeling: the capability-based and the commitment-based views. As a result, a more comprehensive modeling strategy for service relations in ArchiMate is proposed; this strategy is able to reflect business models that employ the service notion, including software-as-a-service (S aaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS). We use a reference ontology for services (UFO-S) to support our analysis.","2325-6605","978-1-4673-9933-3","10.1109/EDOCW.2016.7584386","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7584386","","Organizations;Cable TV;Analytical models;Contracts;Software;Automobiles","","6","","25","IEEE","10 Oct 2016","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, Spoken Document Retrieval (SDR) approaches based on the transcription of content by LVCSR systems must treat the impact of recognition errors on the performance of the information retrieval system. Currently, several multimedia resources (spoken document) are unexploited, because the errors generated in the transcription process, decrease the performance of the systems of searches for spoken documents. Our contribution in this paper is the proposition a novel approach semantic based indexing content of multimedia documents by using the results of a partial automatic transcription to ride out research and indexing problems on these resources. In this context, the main hypothesis is developed around the following question: is it possible to identify and retrieve spoken document by using a semantic content indexing system based on his partial transcription? Also, does the partial content transcription of a spoken document is sufficient for his indexing? First, we are interested to look for a linguistic syntactic representation of the whole of the content spoken document. Then, it will be used to define the most discriminating indexing terms for his content. Nevertheless, in our approach, we have an assumption that the use of segments of a spoken document with an efficient semantic enrichment process instead of the whole spoken document content is sufficient. Also, with this strategy, we can resolve OOV problems, recognition errors and technical terms. Finally, in validation and experimentation phase, we tested the different modules proposed on the TED-LIUM corpora. The results obtained are interesting and encourage us to lead off our future perspectives.","","978-1-5386-4543-7","10.1109/ICNLSP.2018.8374390","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8374390","Semantic content Indexing;Spoken Term detection;L VCSR;Keyword Spotting;Spoken Document;WordNet Ontology;similarity measures","Semantics;Indexing;Multimedia communication;Speech recognition;Syntactics;Lattices","","3","","17","IEEE","7 Jun 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Many tailoring approaches have been proposed by orienting different aspects such as process, resource and goal. While the interaction between team members is very important in agile methods, none of these approaches focuses on the socio-intentional aspect. In the literature, we can find many case studies that link socio-intentional aspects to the tailoring of agile practices. Even though it is helpful to know it, locating relevant information can be effort and time-consuming. This research proposes a socio-intentional framework that can analyze agile practices and indicate how to tailor them with the help of an evidence-based tool and a modeling language. This framework will allow practitioners to identify the right practices to achieve their goals and analyze their suitability and vulnerability. It will also indicate how to successfully implement them in the software development process.","2378-1971","978-1-6654-2069-3","10.1109/CBI52690.2021.10065","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9610664","Evidence-based System;Ontology;Tailoring Agile;Socio-intentional Modeling","Analytical models;Visualization;Systematics;Focusing;Tools;Software;Planning","","","","25","IEEE","19 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The SysReqs and emerging architecture are constructed through gradual and iterative transition from the problem domain and operational stakeholder requirements to the conceptual solution domain. They later constitute the basis for functional requirements elaborating, concept formation, technology selection, function-to-form allocation, and asset utilization. Only rarely can stakeholder requirements (SHRs) readily translate to SysReqs. Systems engineers must therefore elicit, analyze, and evolve the SysReqs, as these will radically affect the system's performance, robustness, endurance, and appeal. Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) provides a framework for effective and consistent systems engineering and architecting. MBSE relies on modeling languages, such as Object-Process Methodology (OPM). OPM is a holistic MBSE paradigm and language for complex systems and processes, standardized as ISO 19450, which relies on the principle of minimal universal ontology. In this paper, we propose a model-based requirement engineering (MBRE) approach to facilitate the transition from SHRs to SysReqs, and from SysReqs to system architecture specification. We demonstrate the applicability of this framework in architecting a robotic baggage loading system for a leading international airport.","","978-1-5386-3403-5","10.1109/SysEng.2017.8088273","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8088273","Model-Based Systems Engineering;Object-Process Methodology;Requirements Engineering;Systems Architecting","Modeling;Stakeholders;Unified modeling language;Requirements engineering;Standards;Complex systems","","22","","29","IEEE","30 Oct 2017","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

The Resource-Event-Agent (REA) business ontology describes a metamodel for internal business activities (e.g., production) and for inter-organizational exchange constellations on the enterprise resource planning (ERP) level. ISA-95 is a series of standards targeting the integration of enterprise control systems on the interface between ERP systems and manufacturing execution systems.

This paper presents a first-principles risk assessment framework underlying the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice for AI Risk, Safety, Trustworthiness, and Responsibility. We distinguish between process risks (risks arising from how AI systems are built or operated) and outcome risks (risks manifest in the AI system's outputs and their real-world effects), arguing that generative AI governance should prioritize outcome risks. Central to our approach is an information-centric ontology that classifies AI-generated outputs into four fundamen-tal categories: (1) Perception-level information, (2) Knowledge-level information, (3) Decision/Action plan information, and (4) Control tokens (access or resource directives). This classification allows systematic identification of harms and more precise attribution of responsibility to stakeholders (developers, deployers, users, regulators) based on the nature of the information produced. We illustrate how each information type entails distinct outcome risks (e.g, deception, misinformation, unsafe recommendations, security breaches) and requires tailored risk metrics and mitigations. By grounding the framework in the essence of information, human agency, and cognition, we align risk evaluation with how AI outputs influence human understanding and action. The result is a principled approach to AI risk that supports clear accountability and targeted safeguards, in contrast to broad application-based risk categorizations. We include example tables mapping information types to risks and responsibilities. This work aims to inform the IEEE P3396 Recommended Practice and broader AI governance with a rigorous, first-principles foundation for assessing generative AI risks while enabling responsible innovation.","","979-8-3315-2400-5","10.1109/CAI64502.2025.00237","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11050553","Risk;Information Categorization;AI Agency;Human Agency;GenAl","Ethics;Technological innovation;Regulators;Generative AI;Standards organizations;Organizations;Cognition;Stakeholders;Security;Fake news","","","","23","IEEE","7 Jul 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Using this framework requires experts to construct a DPSIR taxonomy from a corpus, annotate the documents, and identify DPSIR variables and relationships, which is laborious and inflexible. Automating it with conventional text mining faces technical challenges, primarily because the taxonomy often begins with abstract definitions, which experts progressively refine and contextualize as they annotate the corpus. In response, we develop GreenMine, a system that supports interactive text mining with prompt engineering. The system implements a prompting pipeline consisting of three simple and evaluable subtasks. In each subtask, the DPSIR taxonomy can be defined in natural language and iteratively refined as experts analyze the corpus. To support users evaluate the taxonomy, we introduce an uncertainty score based on response consistency. Then, we design a radial uncertainty chart that visualizes uncertainties and corpus topics, which supports interleaved evaluation and exploration. Using the system, experts can progressively construct the DPSIR taxonomy and annotate the corpus with LLMs. Using real-world interview transcripts, we present a case study to demonstrate the capability of the system in supporting interactive mining of DPSIR relationships, and an expert review in the form of collaborative discussion to understand the potential and limitations of the system.

This study explores the effectiveness of deep learning (DL) models in semantic and personalized information retrieval (SIR), focusing on BERT and other large language models (LLMs) that provide context-sensitive embeddings and advanced language comprehension capabilities. Through a detailed analysis, this paper demonstrates how DL models can significantly enhance accuracy and relevance in IR, using evaluation metrics critical for assessing model performance. Metrics like recall, precision, and F1-score are key in capturing model accuracy and coverage; for example, a recall of $\mathbf{1. 0}$ indicates complete retrieval of relevant instances, while a precision of 0.6 reflects a $\mathbf{6 0 \%}$ accuracy in positive predictions, balancing these measures at an F1-score of 46.15%. Ranking and prioritization metrics, such as Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), evaluated at 91.67% and 95.1%, respectively highlight the models’ capabilities in prioritizing relevant results effectively. In personalized and semantic search, selecting the right evaluation metrics is essential to maximize DL model potential and improve the user experience. Recent LLM advancements, like GPT-4, are instrumental in capturing nuanced meanings and understanding complex user queries, which enhances the accuracy of search engines. Continuous optimization of these models through tailored metrics can improve IR systems’ contextual relevance and accuracy, fostering greater user satisfaction.","","979-8-3315-4121-7","10.1109/ICAICCIT64383.2024.10912181","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10912181","BERT;Deep Learning Models;Evaluation;Metrics;Personalized IR;Semantic IR;Transformer Models;Ontology;User Profiling","Measurement;Deep learning;Analytical models;Accuracy;Semantic search;Computational modeling;Transformers;User experience;Standards;Context modeling","","","","32","IEEE","13 Mar 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

Nonetheless, the high computational costs associated with training these models have motivated alternative approaches for representation learning. Herein we introduce TripletProt, a new approach for protein representation learning based on the Siamese neural networks. Representation learning of biological entities which capture essential features can alleviate many of the challenges associated with supervised learning in bioinformatics. The most important distinction of our proposed method is relying on the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The computational cost of the generated representations for any potential application is significantly lower than comparable methods since the length of the representations is significantly smaller than that in other approaches. TripletProt offers great potentials for the protein informatics tasks and can be widely applied to similar tasks. We evaluate TripletProt comprehensively in protein functional annotation tasks including sub-cellular localization (14 categories) and gene ontology prediction (more than 2000 classes), which are both challenging multi-class, multi-label classification machine learning problems. We compare the performance of TripletProt with the state-of-the-art approaches including a recurrent language model-based approach (i.e., UniRep), as well as a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and sequence-based method (i.e., DeepGO). Our TripletProt showed an overall improvement of F1 score in the above mentioned comprehensive functional annotation tasks, solely relying on the PPI network.

Traditional compression methods often fail to adapt efficiently to these complexities, leading to sub-optimal storage and analysis performance. Additionally, while several metadata schemas exist to enhance the availability of RWD, smaller organizations often lack the resources to create and manage metadata effectively. This paper introduces RWD Profile, an automatically generatable metadata schema for RWD, and SemantiPack, which applies tailored compression to data fields in the individual RWD based on RWD Profile. RWD Profile has two kinds of metadata, Structural Profile and Semantic Profile. Structural Profile is generated through rule-based systems, while Semantic Profile is generated using large language models (LLMs) to capture semantic data properties. On the other hand, SemantiPack performs compression at the data field level in RWD using RWD Profile to achieve higher compression ratios. Experimental results demonstrate up to 23.2% improved compression rate for JSON and 19.3% for CSV compared to conventional methods while maintaining a faster or equivalent processing speed compared to conventional methods. Furthermore, SemantiPack supports lossy compression for applications prioritizing storage over precision. This research not only improves compression efficiency but also establishes a scalable solution for automated analysis and sustainable data utilization, paving the way for advancements in RWD management.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3583829","Commissioned Research by the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology (NICT)(grant numbers:22609); Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI, Japan(grant numbers:22H03696,22K18422,22H03580); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11053835","Data compression;real-world data;linked data;semantic web","Metadata;Semantics;Data compression;Image coding;Sensor phenomena and characterization;Resource description framework;Ontologies;Standards organizations;Wireless sensor networks;Transform coding","","","","79","CCBYNCND","27 Jun 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

On the other hand, multiple choice questions are suitable for efficient self-learning. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to create multiple choice questions that can reinforce learners' panoramic knowledge. Specifically, we proposed a method for automatically generating multiple choice questions that use Linked Data to present relevant information to give respondents an overall picture of relevant knowledge. There is some research on the methods that generated questions by extracting small subgraphs from the knowledge graphs consisting of entities(words) and relations(links) between the entities and hiding target words (correct answer words). In this study, our goal is to enhance the panoramic of the subgraphs of a specified size by using the link prediction method to complement edges and represent relationships not present in the knowledge graph when generating questions targeted at specific fields. The method of complementing edges involves first inputting two words as subject and object in Knowledge Graph to calculate the cosine similarity using a pretrained language model based on Wikipedia and Wikidata, then predicting the links as a predicate that should be complemented, and finally generating subgraphs by using the Graph Database added the complemented edges. For this study, we generated questions in the field of history, and since history requires temporal and spatial panoramic knowledge, words related to these aspects were focused on and complemented the relationships between them. As a result, 2,746 relationships were complemented by the proposed method in the subgraphs, and the subgraphs contained more words to learn (words found in textbooks that need to be learned) in a specific field compared to those generated using existing methods.","2836-5992","979-8-3503-5567-3","10.1109/CCET62233.2024.10837958","JSPS KAKENHI(grant numbers:JP22K12157,JP23K28377,JP24H00714,JP22K18008); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10837958","Panoramic Knowledge;Linked Data;Knowledge Graph;Automatic Generate Question;Educational Application","Hands;Databases;Linked data;Computational modeling;Knowledge graphs;Encyclopedias;Predictive models;History;Online services","","1","","22","IEEE","16 Jan 2025","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"

However, in practical maintenance operations, technicians rely heavily on personal experience and extensive domain manuals, which can reduce the accuracy and efficiency of decision-making processes. This paper proposes a knowledge graph-based dual-modal collaborative QA (KGD-QA) framework for hydropower operation and maintenance. Firstly, a multi-granularity segmentation strategy is used to divide domain manuals into thematically grouped text blocks and path-labeled sentence units. Secondly, a LoRA-fine-tuned large language model (LLM), guided by domain ontologies and chain-of-thought prompts, extracts entity-relation triples. Finally, a dual-modal QA mechanism is designed to integrate knowledge graph subgraph queries and text vector retrieval, enabling information acquisition in both detailed and global modes. Experimental results show that, compared with baseline model, this approach improves the accuracy of knowledge extraction while the dual-modal collaborative QA retrieval method provides more traceable and evidence-backed responses to maintenance-related queries. This framework offers a novel paradigm for advancing intelligent operation and maintenance technologies for hydropower equipment.","","978-1-83724-701-1","10.1049/icp.2025.2348","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11090152","","","","","","","","23 Jul 2025","","","IET","IET Conferences"

The main problem in extracting medical information is that physicians use variant words to describe the same disease/treatment. In order to help physicians interpret and share disease/treatment information in clinic notes, we need to reliably and effectively detect and normalize the medical terms. In this study, we perform detection/normalization of medical terms using a UMLS meta-thesaurus combined with a document retrieval technique. We regard a medical sentence as a query, and a UMLS ontology entry as a document, and try to apply a language modeling-based information retrieval method as currently used in the document retrieval field. Because the term frequency in the UMLS dictionary is uniform, we employ a domain-specific term frequency instead of traditional term frequency. To retrieve only the relevant terms in 900,000 UMLS entries, we also propose an adaptive ranking method which dynamically determines the relevant documents for each query without using static cut-off threshold. The experimental results outperform the previous methods in detecting and normalizing medical terms in Medline clinical trials, and our approach can be used in normalizing the real diagnosis list in the patient charts of physicians.","2641-3604","978-1-4244-6561-3","10.1109/ITAB.2010.5687670","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5687670","","Diseases;Drugs;Unified modeling language;Medical diagnostic imaging;Muscles;Lungs","","2","1","12","IEEE","17 Jan 2011","","","IEEE","IEEE Conferences"
