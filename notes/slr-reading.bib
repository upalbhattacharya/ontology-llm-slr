LLMs have shown significant advancements in natural language processing, demonstrating their ability to capture complex language patterns in different knowledge domains. Our LLMs4OL paradigm investigates the following hypothesis: Can LLMs effectively apply their language pattern capturing capability to OL, which involves automatically extracting and structuring knowledge from natural language text? To test this hypothesis, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation using the zero-shot prompting method. We evaluate nine different LLM model families for three main OL tasks: term typing, taxonomy discovery, and extraction of non-taxonomic relations. Additionally, the evaluations encompass diverse genres of ontological knowledge, including lexicosemantic knowledge in WordNet, geographical knowledge in GeoNames, and medical knowledge in UMLS.},

Since Large Language Models (LLMs) are the best tools for translations, we fine-tuned a GPT-3 model to convert NL into OWL Functional Syntax. For fine-tuning, we designed pairs of sentences in NL and the corresponding translations. This training pairs cover various aspects from ontology engineering: instances, class subsumption, domain and range of relations, object properties relationships, disjoint classes, complements, or cardinality restrictions. The resulted axioms are used to enrich an ontology, in a human supervised manner. The developed tool is publicly provided as a Protégé plugin.},
