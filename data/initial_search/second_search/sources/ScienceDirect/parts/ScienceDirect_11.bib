abstract = {Road crashes cost over a million lives each year. Consequently, researchers and transport engineers continue their efforts to improve road safety and minimize road crashes. With the increasing availability of various sensor technologies to capture road safety-related data and the recent breakthrough in modern data-driven techniques, in particular Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques, data-driven road safety research has gained significant attention in the past few years. As road safety involves a number of different aspects, including road infrastructure (e.g., surface conditions), road user behaviors (e.g., driver/pedestrian behavior), and traffic congestion, critically reviewing all these major aspects and their relationships with road crashes is a challenging task. In this paper, we present a detailed review of 70 articles, which are shortlisted from 2871 articles found by searching relevant keywords from the scopus IEEE digital library and google scholar databases. To better analyze the data-driven road safety research a number of taxonomies are first introduced to characterize data sources Equipment & sensors to capture data And methodologies to analyze and make decisions based on data. Then Based on the defined taxonomies Selected research articles covering different aspects of road safety are critically analyzed. This study highlights important directions for future work and some major challenges such as data collection Poor data quality and lack of ground truth data.}

This study for the first time reported a strain SNF1 affiliated with Hydrogenophaga can efficiently degrade sulfamethoxazole (SMX). Strain SNF1 prefers growing under extra carbon sources and neutral condition, and could degrade 500 mg/L SMX completely within 16 h. Under the conditions optimized by response surface method (3.11 g/L NaAc, 0.77 g/L (NH4)2SO4, pH = 7.53, and T = 34.38 ℃), a high removal rate constant 0.5104 /h for 50 mg/L SMX was achieved. Coupling the intermediate products identification with comparative genomic analysis, a novel SMX degradation pathway was proposed. Unlike Actinomycetota degraders, SMX was deaminized and ring ortho-hydroxylated in strain SNF1 using a Rieske dioxygenase in combination with glutamine synthetase system. Rieske dioxygenase gene expression was up-regulated by 1.09 to 6.02-fold in response to 100 mg/L SMX. When SMX is fully degraded, its antimicrobial activity drops by over 90 %, and its anticipated toxicity to aquatic organisms were overall reduced. These findings provided new insights into SMX-degrading microorganisms and mechanisms and highlighted the potential of Hydrogenophaga. sp. SNF1 for biological elimination of SMX from wastewater.}

abstract = {Background
While genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified germline variants influencing the risk of developing colorectal cancer (CRC), there has been limited examination of the possible role of inherited variation as a determinant of patient outcome.
Patients and methods
We performed a GWAS for overall survival (OS) in 1926 patients with advanced CRC from the COIN and COIN-B clinical trials. For single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) showing an association with OS (P < 1.0 × 10−5), we conducted sensitivity analyses based on the time from diagnosis to death and sought independent replications in 5675 patients from the Study of Colorectal Cancer in Scotland (SOCCS) and 16,964 patients from the International Survival Analysis in Colorectal cancer Consortium (ISACC). We analysed the Human Protein Atlas to determine if ERBB4 expression was associated with survival in 438 patients with colon adenocarcinomas.
Results
The most significant SNP associated with OS was rs79612564 in ERBB4 (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.24, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.16–1.32, P = 1.9 × 10−7). SNPs at 17 loci had suggestive associations for OS and all had similar effects on the time from diagnosis to death. No lead SNPs were independently replicated in the meta-analysis of all patients from SOCCS and ISACC. However, rs79612564 was significant in stage-IV patients from SOCCS (P = 2.1 × 10−2) but not ISACC (P = 0.89) and SOCCS combined with COIN and COIN-B attained genome-wide significance (P = 1.7 × 10−8). Patients with high ERBB4 expression in their colon adenocarcinomas had worse survival (HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 1.1–1.9, P = 4.6 × 10−2).
Conclusions
Genetic and expression data support a potential role for rs79612564 in the receptor tyrosine kinase ERBB4 as a predictive biomarker of survival.}

Such problems involve finding all instances (aka embedding) of the small-sized query graph in the associated large-sized reference graph. Many state-of-the-art algorithms, including VF3, RI, CFL-Match, and Glasgow, exist to solve subgraph matching problem. RI is one of the fastest subgraph matching algorithms focusing mainly on time efficiency performance measures. However, other performance measures, such as the number of found instances of the query graph (embedding count), the method of ordering the query graph’s vertices, and the number of recursive calls, are crucial for the efficiency and effectiveness of the subgraph matching. In this paper, the RI+ algorithm is proposed as an enhanced version of RI, which has been designed using candidate region-based decomposition and ordering. Three novel candidate region orderings have been introduced, namely vertex-count, density, and average-path-length, based on the structural properties of the candidate regions. On empirical analysis of RI+ on real-world data sets, it was observed that RI+ shows significant improvement in efficiency and effectiveness over RI on both performance evaluation measures, namely, embedding count and search time. The influence of the proposed candidate region orderings on the search time of RI+ was also analyzed, revealing that a suitable candidate region ordering has the potential to improve the search time of the proposed algorithm.}

abstract = {Summary
Background
Chronic cluster headache is the most disabling form of cluster headache. The mainstay of treatment is attack prevention, but the available management options have little efficacy and are associated with substantial side-effects. In this study, we aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation for treatment of chronic cluster headache.
Methods
We did a randomised, sham-controlled, parallel group, double-blind, safety and efficacy study at 21 headache centres in the USA. We recruited patients aged 22 years or older with chronic cluster headache, who reported a minimum of four cluster headache attacks per week that were unsuccessfully controlled by preventive treatments. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) via an online adaptive randomisation procedure to either stimulation of the sphenopalatine ganglion or a sham control that delivered a cutaneous electrical stimulation. Patients and the clinical evaluator and surgeon were masked to group assignment. The primary efficacy endpoint, which was analysed with weighted generalised estimated equation logistic regression models, was the difference between groups in the proportion of stimulation-treated ipsilateral cluster attacks for which relief from pain was achieved 15 min after the start of stimulation without the use of acute drugs before that timepoint. Efficacy analyses were done in all patients who were implanted with a device and provided data for at least one treated attack during the 4-week experimental phase. Safety was assessed in all patients undergoing an implantation procedure up to the end of the open-label phase of the study, which followed the experimental phase. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02168764.
Findings
Between July 9, 2014, and Feb 14, 2017, 93 patients were enrolled and randomly assigned, 45 to the sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation group and 48 to the control group. 36 patients in the sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation group and 40 in the control group had at least one attack during the experimental phase and were included in efficacy analyses. The proportion of attacks for which pain relief was experienced at 15 min was 62·46% (95% CI 49·15–74·12) in the sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation group versus 38·87% (28·60–50·25) in the control group (odds ratio 2·62 [95% CI 1·28–5·34]; p=0·008). Nine serious adverse events were reported by the end of the open-label phase. Three of these serious adverse events were related to the implantation procedure (aspiration during intubation, nausea and vomiting, and venous injury or compromise). A fourth serious adverse event was an infection that was attributed to both the stimulation device and the implantation procedure. The other five serious adverse events were unrelated. There were no unanticipated serious adverse events.
Interpretation
Sphenopalatine ganglion stimulation seems efficacious and is well tolerated, and potentially offers an alternative approach to the treatment of chronic cluster headache. Further research is need to clarify its place in clinical practice.

abstract = {Summary
Chloroplasts develop from undifferentiated plastids in response to light. In angiosperms, after the perception of light, the Elongated Hypocotyl 5 (HY5) transcription factor initiates photomorphogenesis, and two families of transcription factors known as GOLDEN2-LIKE (GLK) and GATA are considered master regulators of chloroplast development. In addition, the MIR171-targeted SCARECROW-LIKE GRAS transcription factors also impact chlorophyll biosynthesis. The extent to which these proteins carry out conserved roles in non-seed plants is not known. Using the model liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, we show that GLK controls chloroplast biogenesis, and HY5 shows a small conditional effect on chlorophyll content. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that MpGLK has a broader set of targets than has been reported in angiosperms. We also identified a functional GLK homolog in green algae. In summary, our data support the hypothesis that GLK carries out a conserved role relating to chloroplast biogenesis in land plants and green algae.}

A/B testing is widely used in practice to enable data-driven decision making for software development. While a few studies have explored different facets of research on A/B testing, no comprehensive study has been conducted on the state-of-the-art in A/B testing. Such a study is crucial to provide a systematic overview of the field of A/B testing driving future research forward. To address this gap and provide an overview of the state-of-the-art in A/B testing, this paper reports the results of a systematic literature review that analyzed primary studies. The research questions focused on the subject of A/B testing, how A/B tests are designed and executed, what roles stakeholders have in this process, and the open challenges in the area. Analysis of the extracted data shows that the main targets of A/B testing are algorithms, visual elements, and workflow and processes. Single classic A/B tests are the dominating type of tests, primarily based in hypothesis tests. Stakeholders have three main roles in the design of A/B tests: concept designer, experiment architect, and setup technician. The primary types of data collected during the execution of A/B tests are product/system data, user-centric data, and spatio-temporal data. The dominating use of the test results are feature selection, feature rollout, continued feature development, and subsequent A/B test design. Stakeholders have two main roles during A/B test execution: experiment coordinator and experiment assessor. The main reported open problems are related to the enhancement of proposed approaches and their usability. From our study we derived three interesting lines for future research: strengthen the adoption of statistical methods in A/B testing, improving the process of A/B testing, and enhancing the automation of A/B testing.}

Loading of skeletal muscle changes the tissue phenotype reflecting altered metabolic and functional demands. In humans, heterogeneous adaptation to loading complicates the identification of the underpinning molecular regulators. A within-person differential loading and analysis strategy reduces heterogeneity for changes in muscle mass by ∼40% and uses a genome-wide transcriptome method that models each mRNA from coding exons and 3′ and 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs). Our strategy detects ∼3–4 times more regulated genes than similarly sized studies, including substantial UTR-selective regulation undetected by other methods. We discover a core of 141 genes correlated to muscle growth, which we validate from newly analyzed independent samples (n = 100). Further validating these identified genes via RNAi in primary muscle cells, we demonstrate that members of the core genes were regulators of protein synthesis. Using proteome-constrained networks and pathway analysis reveals notable relationships with the molecular characteristics of human muscle aging and insulin sensitivity, as well as potential drug therapies.}

However, gathering ample data in real-world scenarios is often challenging, rendering these deep-learning techniques ineffective. This paper introduces a novel Prototype Matching-based Meta-Learning (PMML) approach to address the few-shot fault diagnosis under constrained data conditions. Initially, the PMML’s feature extractor is meta-trained within the Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning framework, utilizing multiple fault classification tasks from known operational conditions in the source domain to acquire prior meta-knowledge for fault diagnosis. Subsequently, the trained feature extractor is employed to derive meta-features from few-shot samples in the target domain, and metric learning is conducted to facilitate swift and precise few-shot fault diagnosis, leveraging meta-knowledge and similarity information across sample sets. Moreover, instead of utilizing all target domain samples, the prototype of each fault category is used to capture similarity information between support and query samples. Concurrently, BiLSTM is employed to selectively embed the meta-feature prototype, enabling the extraction of more distinguishable metric features for enhanced metric learning. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed PMML is validated through a series of comparative experiments on two fault datasets, demonstrating its outstanding performance in addressing both zero-shot and few-shot fault diagnosis challenges.}

However, less knowledge is obtained regarding the transformation pathways between various chemical structures of ECs under different treatment processes. This study unveiled the transformation pathways of ECs with different structures in 15 WWTPs distributed across China by simplified network analysis (SNA) we proposed. After treatment, the molecular weight of the whole component of wastewater decreased and the hydrophilicity increased. There are significant differences in the structure of eliminated, consistent and formed pollutants. Amino acids, peptides, and analogues (AAPAs) were detected most frequently and most removable. Benzenoids were refractory. Triazoles were often produced. The high-frequency reactions in different WWTPs were similar, (de)methylation and dehydration occurred most frequently. Different biological treatment processes performed similarly, while some advanced treatment processes differed, such as a significant increase of -13.976 (2HO reaction) paired mass distances (PMDs) in the chlorine alone process. Further, the common structural transformation was uncovered. 4 anti-hypertensive drugs, including irbesartan, valsartan, olmesartan, and losartan, were identified, along with 22 transformation products (TPs) of them. OH2 and H2O PMDs occurred most frequently and in 80.81 % of the parent-transformation product pairs, the intensity of the product was higher than parent in effluents, whose risk should be considered in future assessment activity. Together our results provide a macrography perspective on the transformation processes of ECs in WWTPs. In the future, selectively adopting wastewater treatment technology according to structures is conductive for eliminating recalcitrant ECs in WWTPs.}

abstract = {Background & Aims
Dysregulation of one-carbon metabolism is considered an early hallmark of mitochondrial dysfunction and cancer metabolism. ALDH1L2 belongs to the aldehyde dehydrogenase family and plays an important role in tumor progression. However, little is known about the precise role and underlying mechanisms of ALDH1L2 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
Methods
Immunohistochemistry, western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were used to evaluate ALDH1L2 expression in HCC samples (n = 90) and cell lines (n = 9). A series of in vitro and in vivo assays were performed to explore the role and molecular mechanism of ALDH1L2 in HCC progression.
Results
ALDH1L2 upregulation is associated with poor prognosis in HCC (hazard ratio 1.923; 95% confidence interval 1.03–3.59; p = 0.04). ALDH1L2 promotes tumor cell proliferation and metastasis by activating NRF2/IL-6/STAT3 signaling. ALDH1L2 promotes mitochondrial respiration, increases ATP production and protects HCC cells from reactive oxygen species-induced cellular damage via NRF2 stabilization. NRF2 also directly binds to the ALDH1L2 promoter and increases ALDH1L2 transcription, thereby establishing a positive feedback loop to maintain the function of ALDH1L2. The interaction between tumor-associated macrophages and ALDH1L2-overexpressing HCC cells further promotes HCC progression. In addition, ALDH1L2 knockdown enhances the anti-HCC activity of the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib.
Conclusions
These findings provide the first evidence indicating that ALDH1L2 is directly involved in tumor progression by interacting with tumor-associated macrophages through the Jak2/STAT3 signaling pathway and that ALDH1L2 may be a target molecule for HCC therapy.
Impact and implications:
This research highlights that ALDH1L2 could serve as a predictive and prognostic marker in HCC. We found that a positive feedback loop between ALDH1L2 and NRF2 promotes HCC progression by activating the IL-6/Jak2/STAT3 signaling axis and tumor-associated macrophage polarization. In addition, we found that ALDH1L2 knockdown enhances the anti-HCC effect of sorafenib.}

abstract = {Are lonely youngsters turning to chatbots to fill their social needs? The present research contributes to the ongoing scientific endeavors to understand the adoption of chatbots as social companions. Specifically, we examined how many Danish high-school students engage in friend-like conversations with chatbots, why they engage in such conversations, and whether this trend is associated with the sense of social connectedness (operationalized as loneliness and perceived social support). In pursuing this goal, a preregistered mixed-methods cross-sectional survey study was carried out. A total sample of 1599 students from 15 Danish high schools was collected. In total, 234 students (14.6 %) responded that they engaged in friend-like conversations with chatbots. Qualitative thematic analyses of free-text responses revealed two dominant ways of engaging with chatbots: utilitarian conversations (n = 174) and social-supportive conversations (n = 39). A major finding was that social-supportive chatbot users reported significantly more loneliness than non-chatbot users (d = 0.53) and utilitarian chatbot users (d = 0.52). Furthermore, social-supportive chatbot users also reported significantly less perceived social support than non-chatbot users (d = −0.46). Analyses also showed significant associations between higher loneliness and less perceived social support and various situational triggers for initiating conversations with chatbots, including bad mood, a need for self-disclosure, and a sense of loneliness, but not with a sense of friendship to the chatbot as a trigger of chatbot interactions. These findings suggest a trend among some socially disconnected Danish high-school students toward using chatbots to cope with negative emotions.}

abstract = {Efficiently representing source code is crucial for various software engineering tasks such as code classification and clone detection. Existing approaches primarily use Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), and only a few focus on semantic graphs such as Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Program Dependency Graph (PDG), which contain information about source code that AST does not. Even though some works tried to utilize multiple representations, they do not provide any insights about the costs and benefits of using multiple representations. The primary goal of this paper is to discuss the implications of utilizing multiple source code representations, specifically AST, CFG, and PDG. We modify an AST path-based approach to accept multiple representations as input to an attention-based model. We do this to measure the impact of additional representations (such as CFG and PDG) over AST. We evaluate our approach on three tasks: Method Naming, Program Classification, and Clone Detection. Our approach increases the performance on these tasks by 11% (F1), 15.7% (Accuracy), and 9.3% (F1), respectively, over the baseline. In addition to the effect on performance, we discuss timing overheads incurred with multiple representations. We envision that this work can provide a base for researchers to explore and experiment with a variety of source code representations for software engineering tasks.}

The biodegradation kinetics, pathways, and genomic background of SMD by FA were investigated. The results showed that strain FA had high specificity to degrade SMD, and was unable to effectively degrade its isomer, sulfamonomethoxine. The SMD biodegradation followed a first-order kinetic model with a rate constant of 27.39 mg·L-1·day-1 and a half-life of 5.98 days. The biodegradation pathways and detoxification processes of SMD were proposed based on the identification of its biodegradation byproducts and the biotoxicity assessment using both the ecological structure-activity relationship (ECOSAR) model and biological indicator. The involvement of novel degrading enzymes, such as dimethyllsulfone monooxygenase, 4-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase, and 1,4-benzoquinone reductase, was inferred in the SMD biodegradation process. The presence of sul2 and dfrA genes in strain FA, which were constitutively expressed in its cells, suggests that multiple mechanisms were employed by the strain to resist SMD. This study provides new insights into the biodegradation of sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) as it is the first to describe an SMD-degrading bacterium and its genetic information.}

The questionnaire was distributed on a random sample of 300 volunteering participants has been obtained through the online survey. An interview has been also conducted with high school English teachers to get sufficient information about the social media usage and its effect on their students. Four teachers were asked to provide random grades of their students to check how they are affected. Another questionnaire has been added to know whether the social media platforms usage during the Covid-19 Pandemic helps in the language skills. The approach that has been used to conclude our results is a mixed method of qualitative and quantitative approaches. The results have shown that the skills of the language can be improved by the usage of the social media platforms specially the listening, speaking, and reading skills. The writing skill, however have not shown any improvement after using the social media platforms. Therefore, social media applications can be a reliable tool for learning a second language but it has to be under the guidance and supervision of professional teachers.}

abstract = {The recent advances usually attempt to mine the effective market information from the chaotic data and learn multilevel representations by using attention mechanisms to conduct a stock prediction task. However, such methods usually lack the full utilization of local semantic embedding which contains the abundant textual semantics information. Moreover, these models suffer from the severe noise diffusion in contextual embeddings from a sequence after passing through the RNN. The noises diffusion constrains the performance of the proposed methods. In this work, we propose a stock movement predictive network via incorporative attention mechanisms. The core innovation is that the incorporative attention combines local and contextual attention mechanisms to clean the contextual embeddings by using local semantics. As a result, the attention effectively reduce the noises in the constructed higher-level representations and enhance the performance. Moreover, the local semantics and context are merged into the constructed higher-level representations which provide more abundant local semantic and contextual information. The experimental results demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed approach on tweet and historical price dataset.}

The phosphoproteomics approach was used to explore the mechanisms underlying grapevine tolerance to ozone stress and identify phosphoproteins altered by ozone treatment. Results revealed that 194 of 2275 quantitatively analyzed phosphoproteins were significantly regulated after ozone treatment. Biological pathways related to transport were significantly enriched by the differentially regulated phosphoproteins. Among these phosphoproteins, the phosphorylation of RING E3 ligase in grape (V. vinifera KEEP ON GOING, VvKEG) decreased after ozone treatment. Over-expression of VvKEG in Arabidopsis decreased abscisic acid (ABA) sensitivity and enhanced ozone tolerance. Furthermore, VvKEG interacted with the ABA-responsive transcription factor ABSCISIC ACID-INSENSITIVE3 (ABI3). The exogenous application of ABA on grapevine leaves significantly influenced chlorophyll fluorescence, chlorophyll, and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents under ozone treatment; however, treatment with 150 μmol ABA aggravated ozone stress. These results indicate that phosphorylation modification provides information on ozone-induced processes and that VvKEG plays a critical role in these processes via regulation of the ABA signaling pathway in grape.}

Traditional security policies designed for static environments fall short of addressing the dynamic, heterogeneous, and resource-constrained nature of IoT ecosystems. Existing dynamic security policy models lack versatility and fail to fully integrate comprehensive risk assessments, regulatory compliance, and AI/ML (artificial intelligence/machine learning)-driven adaptability. We develop a novel adaptive edge security framework that dynamically generates and adjusts security policies for IoT edge devices. Our framework integrates a dynamic security policy generator, a conflict detection and resolution in policy generator, a bias-aware risk assessment system, a regulatory compliance analysis system, and an AI-driven adaptability integration system. This approach produces tailored security policies that adapt to changes in the threat landscape, regulatory requirements, and device statuses. Our study identifies critical security challenges in diverse IoT environments and demonstrates the effectiveness of our framework through simulations and real-world scenarios. We found that our framework significantly enhances the adaptability and resilience of IoT security policies. Our results demonstrate the potential of AI/ML integration in creating responsive and robust security measures for IoT ecosystems. The implications of our findings suggest that dynamic and adaptive security frameworks are essential for protecting IoT devices against evolving cyber threats, ensuring compliance with regulatory standards, and maintaining the integrity and availability of IoT services across various applications.}

Le développement des entrepôts de données de santé a rendu possible leur utilisation secondaire notamment à des fins de recherche, sous réserve que ces données soient correctement caractérisées. En particulier, pour les documents médicaux, la connaissance de leur type : comptes-rendus (CR) hospitaliers, ordonnances, CR d'examen, etc. est d'un intérêt majeur y compris pour renseigner le parcours du patient. Néanmoins, cette information est manquante pour une majorité des documents médicaux de l'entrepôt de données de santé (EDS) de l'AP-HP (140 millions de documents collectés depuis 2017). L'objectif de notre étude est de développer et valider un nouvel algorithme de classification des documents.
Méthodes
Les types de documents d'intérêt ont été validés et définis en amont de la campagne, à partir de la “document ontology” de la terminologie LOINC. Les jeux d'entraînement (2700 documents) et de validation (500 documents) ont été annotés par une clinicienne. Le premier jeu d'entraînement a été réalisé à partir d'un clustering effectué sur une représentation vectorielle (TF-IDF) du libellé du document, correspondant à un champ éditable par le clinicien sur le logiciel source. Un sur-échantillonnage a ensuite été réalisé sur certaines unités fonctionnelles pour s'assurer la présence des types peu fréquents. L'algorithme est constitué de recherche d'expressions régulières en cascade avec deux niveaux de granularité : 6 types principaux et 43 types secondaires. Il prend en entrée des métadonnées (libellé de document, libellé de formulaire) et des données issues du texte lui-même (titre du document, corps du texte et entête du document).
Résultats
Sur les types principaux, le f1-score est de 0,76 [0,63, 0,86] sur les CR de consultation, 0,75 [0,5, 0,92] sur les CR d'examen, 0,96 [0,92, 0,98] sur les CR hospitaliers, 0,97 [0,93, 0,99] sur les autres CR (par exemple les urgences ou les RCP), 0,98 [0,97, 0,99] sur les ordonnances et 0,78 [0,71, 0.85] sur les lettres. Sur les types secondaires, à titre d'exemple, le f1-score est de 0,89 sur les CRH-HDJ, de 1 sur les CR-ANAPATH et 0,97 sur les CR paramédicaux.
Conclusion
Nous présentons un nouvel algorithme de typage de documents médicaux efficace sur un très large volume, permettant de traiter les 300 000 nouveaux documents quotidiens à l'AP-HP.}

However, the handcrafted strategy is of low efficiency, incurs high human costs and cannot be generalized to large-scale datasets. To address the problem, we construct a confidence-based Revision framework for DocRE (ReD), aiming to achieve high-quality automatic data revision. Specifically, we first introduce a denoising training module to recognize relational facts and prevent noisy annotations. Second, a confidence-based data revision module is equipped to perform adaptive data revision for long-tail distributed relational facts. After the data revision, we design an iterative training module to create a virtuous cycle, which transforms the revised data into useful training data to support further revision. By capitalizing on ReD, we propose ReD-DocRED, which consists of 101,873 revised annotated documents from DocRED. ReD-DocRED has introduced 57.1% new relational facts, and concurrently, models trained on ReD-DocRED have achieved significant improvements in F1 scores, ranging from 6.35 to 16.55. The experimental results demonstrate that ReD can achieve high-quality data revision and, to some extent, replace manual labeling.11The ReD-DocRED is available at https://github.com/jc4357/ReD-DocRED.}

abstract = {Protein function prediction has been the most worked upon and the most challenging problem for computational biologists. The vast majority of known proteins have yet not been characterised experimentally, and there is significant gap between their structures and functions. New un-annotated sequences are being added to the public protein databases (e.g. UniprotKB) at an enormous pace [1]. Such proteins with unknown functions might play key role in the metabolism, growth and development regulation. Thus, if functions of unknown proteins left undiscovered, researchers may skip important information(s). Based on their sequence, structure, evolutionary history, and their association with other proteins, tools of computational biology can provide insights into the function of proteins [2]. For proteins with well characterised close relatives, it is trivial to infer function. Orphan proteins without discernible sequence relatives present a greater challenge [3]. Here the task of experimental characterisation is blind and becomes unwieldy. It is highly unlikely that all known proteins will ever be completely experimentally characterised [4]. Thus, there is an emergent need to develop fast and accurate computational approaches to fulfil this requirement. Towards this end, we prepared a dataset for protein function prediction by extracting protein sequences and annotations of reviewed prokaryotic proteins (total count 323,719 as accessed on date March 10, 2019) belonging to 9 bacterial phyla Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chlamydiae, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes, Fusobacteria, Proteobacteria, Spirochaetes and Tenericutes. Corresponding to the most frequent 1739 Gene Ontology (Molecular Function) terms, samples were filtered, and 171,212 proteins were retrieved for feature generation. The Dataset was generated by calculating the sequence, sub-sequence, physiochemical, annotation-based features for each 171,212 reviewed proteins using method in [10]. These features constitute a total of 9890 attributes for each sequence of protein along with 1739 Gene Ontology terms. Each protein sequence is assigned one or more of 1739 Gene Ontology (Molecular Function) term as its target label. The Dataset contains the Entry and Entry name of each sequence corresponding to UniprotKB Database. This dataset being huge in size (171,212 samples X 9890 features, 1739 classes with multiple values) and equipped with enough number of positive and negative samples of each 1739 class, is good for testing efficiency of any upcoming deep learning models [5]. We divided the full dataset of 171,212 reviewed proteins in the ratio 3:1 to form Train/Test dataset 1; train dataset with 128,409 samples and test dataset with 42,803 samples to facilitate training of a deep learning model. The train and test datasets are stratified to contain good proportion of each 1739 classes. We then prepared a dataset 2 of pathogenic unreviewed proteins of the 9 bacterial phyla each with 9890 features same as train/train dataset of reviewed proteins but without target labels in order to predict their functions using deep learning model proposed in [5].}

The escalating sophistication of plagiarized content through semantic manipulation and structural reorganization poses significant challenges to existing detection systems that rely primarily on lexical similarity measures. The proposed T-SRE (Transformer-based Semantic Relation Extraction), a novel framework addresses the limitations of traditional n-gram and string-matching approaches by leveraging deep semantic analysis. The proposed framework combines Dependency Parsing (DP) for syntactic relationship mapping and Named Entity Recognition (NER) for contextual entity identification, augmented by a transformer-based neural network that captures long-range contextual dependencies. This learning methodology incorporates three key components: a position-aware word reordering algorithm, Levenshtein distance metric for structural similarity, and contextual word embeddings for semantic preservation detection. The proposed T-SRE enhances text structure recognition by combining position-aware reordering with semantic preservation through ensemble learning. The system implements a hierarchical classification scheme that quantifies plagiarism severity through a four-tier taxonomy: heavy, low, non-plagiarized and verbatim copy. The Udacity benchmark dataset showcases the model’s superior detection capabilities, achieving 92% precision, 89% recall, and an F1-score of 90.5%, particularly in lightweight textual modifications.The framework achieves a granularity score of 1.28, outperforming existing approaches.}

The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus (CoV) disease 2019 (COVID-19) continues to exert a significant burden on health care systems worldwide. With limited treatments available, vaccination remains an effective strategy to counter transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent discussions concerning vaccination strategies have focused on identifying vaccine platforms, number of doses, route of administration, and time to reach peak immunity against SARS-CoV-2. Here, we generated a single-dose, fast-acting vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based vaccine derived from the licensed Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine rVSV-ZEBOV, expressing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the EBOV glycoprotein (VSV-SARS2-EBOV). Rhesus macaques vaccinated intramuscularly (i.m.) with a single dose of VSV-SARS2-EBOV were protected within 10 days and did not show signs of COVID-19 pneumonia. In contrast, intranasal (i.n.) vaccination resulted in limited immunogenicity and enhanced COVID-19 pneumonia compared to results for control animals. While both i.m. and i.n. vaccination induced neutralizing antibody titers, only i.m. vaccination resulted in a significant cellular immune response. RNA sequencing data bolstered these results by revealing robust activation of the innate and adaptive immune transcriptional signatures in the lungs of i.m. vaccinated animals only. Overall, the data demonstrate that VSV-SARS2-EBOV is a potent single-dose COVID-19 vaccine candidate that offers rapid protection based on the protective efficacy observed in our study.
IMPORTANCE The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) vaccine platform rose to fame in 2019, when a VSV-based Ebola virus (EBOV) vaccine was approved by the European Medicines Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for human use against the deadly disease. Here, we demonstrate the protective efficacy of a VSV-EBOV-based COVID-19 vaccine against challenge in nonhuman primates (NHPs). When a single dose of the VSV-SARS2-EBOV vaccine was administered intramuscularly (i.m.), the NHPs were protected from COVID-19 within 10 days. In contrast, if the vaccine was administered intranasally, there was no benefit from the vaccine and the NHPs developed pneumonia. The i.m. vaccinated NHPs quickly developed antigen-specific IgG, including neutralizing antibodies. Transcriptional analysis highlighted the development of protective innate and adaptive immune responses in the i.m. vaccination group only.}

We observed inconsistencies in reporting and methodologies among experimental designs, sample preparations, data acquisitions and bioinformatics, which can affect reproducibility of experimental results. We identified a distinct need to develop reporting guidelines for proteomics use in environmental toxicology and ecotoxicology, increased QA/QC throughout studies, and method optimization with an emphasis on reducing inconsistencies among studies.

The paper finds the most important building blocks - key activities, key resources, and value proposition - and most critical related factors enabling IoT-oriented organisations to create and capture value. Furthermore, our results also suggest that the main difference in the processes of BM building and innovation depend on the different capabilities and competencies possessed by organisations. This study therefore advances the theoretical understanding of the critical factors for the value creation process in the IoT industry's organisations and offers interesting implications for management theory and practice.}

To address this issue, we propose two Relation Regularized Modules (RRM) in this article. The first is the Visual Relation Regularized Module (VRRM), which seeks known visual features that have semantic relations with unknown visual features and leverages these known features to assist in understanding the unknown features. The second is the Text Relation Regularized Module (TRRM), which enhances the keywords in the answers to strengthen the understanding of unknown text features. To evaluate the effectiveness of these modules, we propose two zero-shot Visual Dialog splits for verification: Visual Zero-shot VisDial with unseen visual features and Text Zero-shot VisDial with unseen answers. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed modules achieve state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot Visual Dialog with unseen visual features and unseen answers, while also producing comparable results on the benchmark VisDial v1.0 test dataset.}

abstract = {Background and aims
Cirrhosis is associated with changes in intestinal microbiota that can lead to hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and infections, especially with antibiotic-resistant organisms. However, the impact of gut microbial antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) burden on clinical outcomes is unclear. The aims of the study were to determine the impact of ARGs in cirrhosis-related gut metagenome on outcomes and disease progression, study the effect of rifaximin on ARG burden, and compare ARGs in cirrhosis with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and diabetes.
Methods
In outpatients with cirrhosis who underwent metagenomics, we evaluated change in ARG abundances with progression and their multivariable impact on 90-day hospitalizations and deaths over 1 year. We also studied ARGs pre- and 8 weeks post-rifaximin in patients with compensated cirrhosis in an open-label trial. Finally, ARGs from CKD and diabetes studies were compared with cirrhosis on machine learning.
Results
A total of 163 patients with cirrhosis (43 compensated, 20 ascites-only, 30 HE-only, 70 both) and 40 controls were included. ARG abundances were higher in cirrhosis versus controls and worsened with advancing cirrhosis severity; 44 patients were hospitalized and 14 died. ARG abundances were associated with hospitalizations and mortality while controlling for cirrhosis complications, medications, and demographics. Rifaximin trial: ARG abundance patterns were minimally affected in 19 patients post-rifaximin. CKD/diabetes comparison: ARG abundance patterns in cirrhosis are distinguishable on machine learning and include more gram-positive ARGs.
Conclusions
Cirrhosis is associated with high gut microbial ARG gene burden compared with controls, which worsens with disease progression and may be different from CKD and diabetes. ARGs are not affected by rifaximin and are associated with hospitalizations and death.}

This article will explore the opportunities presented within contemporary UK society for the greater promotion, and eventual mainstreaming, of TJ. It will also consider the challenges faced during this process and how best to overcome these. Its first key area of focus will be upon the potential role of legal education in the UK in educating law students (and academics) about TJ, considering which approaches are likely to be most effective in incorporating TJ perspectives, at what stage this should occur and to what extent TJ is likely to impact on the existing curricula at a time when proposed changes relating to entry into the legal profession are heavily influencing the work of Law Schools. The article will then move on to consider the receptiveness of the UK legal profession to the TJ paradigm in light of recent attempts to move to a competency-based approach to practice and to reconceptualise professionalism to meet the challenges of increasing fragmentation and corporatisation. The third key area it will explore is the UK's recent plans to reintroduce problem-solving courts (“PSCs”) into its criminal justice system. The authors will discuss the downfall of the six UK Drug Court (“DC”) pilots originally established in 2005 theorising upon their failures and reflecting upon whether the current UK criminal justice system is truly able to support a fresh round of PSC initiatives. The article will end with recommendations for ways in which the international TJ community should begin the process of mainstreaming TJ within the UK. It will conclude that there are currently significant opportunities to be utilised, but that this requires significant commitment and mobilisation amongst existing TJ scholars and practitioners.}

Hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia are often observed in individuals with type II diabetes (T2D) and related mouse models. One dysmetabolic biochemical consequence is the non-enzymatic reaction between sugars, lipids, and proteins, favoring protein glycation, glycoxidation, and lipoxidation. Here, we identified oxidative alterations in key components of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecule antigen processing and presentation machinery in vivo under conditions of hyperglycemia-induced metabolic stress. These modifications were linked to epitope-specific changes in endosomal processing efficiency, MHC class II-peptide binding, and DM editing activity. Moreover, we observed some quantitative and qualitative changes in the MHC class II immunopeptidome of Ob/Ob mice on a high-fat diet compared with controls, including changes in the presentation of an apolipoprotein B100 peptide associated previously with T2D and metabolic syndrome-related clinical complications. These findings highlight a link between glycation reactions and altered MHC class II antigen presentation that may contribute to T2D complications.}

abstract = {Background
Little is known about whether UVB can directly influence epigenetic regulatory pathways to induce cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC). This study aimed to identify epigenetic-regulated signalling pathways through global methylation and gene expression profiling and to elucidate their function in CSCC development.
Methods
Global DNA methylation profiling by reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) and genome-wide gene expression analysis by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in eight pairs of matched CSCC and adjacent normal skin tissues were used to investigate the potential candidate gene(s). Clinical samples, animal models, cell lines, and UVB irradiation were applied to validate the mechanism and function of the genes of interest.
Findings
We identified the downregulation of the TGF-β/BMP-SMAD-ID4 signalling pathway in CSCC and increased methylation of inhibitor of DNA binding/differentiation 4 (ID4). In normal human and mouse skin tissues and cutaneous cell lines, UVB exposure induced ID4 DNA methylation, upregulated DNMT1 and downregulated ten-eleven translocation (TETs). Similarly, we detected the upregulation of DNMT1 and downregulation of TETs accompanying ID4 DNA methylation in CSCC tissues. Silencing of DNMT1 and overexpression of TET1 and TET2 in A431 and Colo16 cells led to increased ID4 expression. Finally, we showed that overexpression of ID4 reduced cell proliferation, migration, and invasion, and increased apoptosis in CSCC cell lines and reduced tumourigenesis in mouse models.
Interpretation
The results indicate that ID4 is downregulated by UVB irradiation via DNA methylation. ID4 acts as a tumour suppressor gene in CSCC development.

Cloud computing’s rise as the primary platform for software development and delivery is largely driven by the potential cost savings. However, it is surprising that no empirical evidence has been collected to determine whether cost awareness permeates the development process and how it manifests in practice.
Objective:
This study aims to provide empirical evidence of cost awareness by mining open source repositories of cloud-based applications. The focus is on Infrastructure-as-Code artifacts that automate software (re)deployment on the cloud.
Methods:
A systematic examination of 152735 repositories yielded 2010 relevant hits. We then analyzed 538 relevant commits and 208 relevant issues using inductive and deductive coding and corroborated findings with discussions from Stack Overflow.
Results:
The findings indicate that developers are not only concerned with the cost of their application deployments but also take actions to reduce these costs beyond selecting cheaper cloud services. We also identify research areas for future consideration.
Conclusion:
Although we focus on a particular Infrastructure-as-Code technology (Terraform), the findings can be applicable to cloud-based application development in general. The provided empirical grounding can serve developers seeking to reduce costs through service selection, resource allocation, deployment optimization, and other techniques.}

Design Futures” is an emerging field that arises from the interaction between design and foresight, holding great potential for expansion and development. However, there is still a lack of heuristic design tools to empower the creation of practice cases in design futures. Due to the intricacies of the sub-genres of Design Futures practice cases, our prior work included the development of a universal case description framework with a quantitative tagging system to place the different genres of cases on a common ground for study. Firstly, the study established a global descriptive framework and tagging system (4 segments, 7 primary labels, and 36 secondary labels) around 5 Design Futures sub-types through a qualitative approach. Secondly, the study invited 109 participants from five different subjects areas to conduct an empirical study to validate the proposed framework and quantify the tagging system. The results show that the rationality of the framework is preliminarily confirmed; the strength of the correlation between genres and labels is weak; in terms of the quantification of labels, the study produces 62 valid secondary labels (positive 29, negative 33), accompanied by quantitative data as the basis for recommendation, forming a creativity-enabling, content-rich labeling system that can reflect the characteristics and differences between the many genres of Design Futures. Finally, the study proposes three modes of heuristic design (confirmatory, constructive and open-ended), which provide rules to guide the use and collocation of the tagging system. The results of this research have deepened the understanding of the concepts and structures of knowledge in the field of Design Futures, which will play a more extensive role in design pedagogy and creative inspiration contexts.}

However, most existing works ignore the run-time parameters by only considering the API names, or lack an effective way to capture the correlations between parameter values and malicious activities. In this paper, we propose CTIMD, a deep learning based dynamic malware detection method, which integrates the threat knowledge from CTIs (Cyber Threat Intelligences) into the learning on API call sequences with run-time parameters. It first extracts IOCs (Indicators of Compromise) from CTIs and uses IOCs to assist the identification of the security-sensitive levels of API calls. Then, it embeds API calls and the associated security-sensitive levels into a unified feature space. Finally, it feeds the feature vector sequences into deep neural networks to train the malware detection model. We conducted experiments on two datasets. The experiment results show that CTIMD significantly outperforms existing methods depending on raw API call sequences (F1-score is improved by 4.0 %∼41.3 %), and also has advantage over existing state-of-the-art methods that consider both API calls and run-time parameters (F1-score is improved by 1.2 %∼6.5 %).}

The high-grain diets fed to ruminants generally alters the structure and function of rumen microbiota, resulting in variations of rumen fermentation patterns and the occurrence of subacute rumen acidosis (SARA). To clarify the microbial mechanism for carbohydrate metabolism during SARA, 8 ruminally cannulated Holstein cows in mid lactation were selected for a 3-wk experiment. The cows were randomly divided into 2 groups, fed either a conventional diet (CON; 40% concentrate; dry matter basis) or a high-grain diet (HG; 60% concentrate; dry matter basis). Compared with the CON diet, the HG diet reduced average daily pH (5.71 vs. 6.13), acetate concentration (72.56 vs. 78.44 mM), acetate ratio (54.81 vs. 65.24%), and the ratio of the concentrations of acetate to propionate (1.87 vs. 3.21) but increased the concentrations of total volatile fatty acids (133.03 vs. 120.22 mM), propionate (41.32 vs. 24.71 mM), and valerate (2.46 vs. 1.68 mM) and the propionate ratio (30.51 vs. 20.47%). Taxonomic analysis indicated that the HG cows had a higher relative abundance of Ruminococcus, Eubacterium, Selenomonas, Ruminobacter, Succinimonas, Methanomicrobium, and Methanocaldococcus accompanied by a lower relative abundance of unclassified Firmicutes, unclassified Bacteroidetes, Bacteroides, Fibrobacter, Alistipes, Candidatus Methanoplasma, Methanomassiliicoccus, and Methanolobus. Carbohydrate-active enzyme annotation suggested that there was enriched abundance of glycosyltransferases (GT) 2, glycoside hydrolase (GH) 13, GH24, carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) 26, GH73, GH25, CBM12, GH23, GT8, CBM50, and GT9 and reduced abundance of GH78, GH31, S-layer homology, GH109, carbohydrate esterase 1, GH3, carbohydrate esterase 10, and GH43 in the HG group. Functional profiling revealed that the HG feeding mainly downregulated the pentose phosphate pathway of carbohydrate catabolism, acetate metabolism, propionate metabolism (succinate pathway), and methane metabolism, whereas it upregulated the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas and Entner-Doudoroff pathways of glycolysis and the citrate cycle. Additionally, the HG feeding promoted the abundance of various antibiotic resistance genes and antimicrobial resistance gene families. These results elucidated the structure and function adjustment of rumen microbiota for carbohydrate metabolism and summarized the enrichment of rumen antibiotic resistance genes under the HG feeding, which expands our understanding of the mechanism underlying the response of rumen microbiota to SARA in dairy cattle.}

ABSTRACT
Bradyrhizobium guangxiense CCBAU53363 efficiently nodulates peanut but exhibits incompatible interaction with mung bean. By comparing the common nod region with those of other peanut bradyrhizobia efficiently nodulating these two hosts, distinctive characteristics with a single nodD isoform (nodD1) and a truncated nolA were identified. However, the regulatory roles of NodD1 and NolA and their coordination in legume-bradyrhizobial interactions remain largely unknown in terms of explaining the contrasting symbiotic compatibility. Here, we report that nolA was important for CCBAU53363 symbiosis with peanut but restricted nodulation on mung bean, while nodD1 was dispensable for CCBAU53363 symbiosis with peanut but essential for nodulation on mung bean. Moreover, nolA exerted a cumulative contribution with nodD1 to efficient symbiosis with peanut. Additionally, mutants lacking nolA delayed nodulation on peanut, and both nolA and nodD1 were required for competitive nodule colonization. It is noteworth that most of the nodulation genes and type III secretion system (T3SS)-related genes were significantly downregulated in a strain 53ΔnodD1nolA mutant compared to wild-type strain CCBAU53363, and the downregulated nodulation genes also had a greater impact than T3SS-related genes on the symbiotic defect of 53ΔnodD1nolA on peanut, which was supported by a more severe symbiotic defect induced by 53ΔnodC than that with the 53ΔnodD1nopP, 53ΔnodD1rhcJ, and 53ΔnodD1ttsI mutants. NolA did not regulate nod gene expression but did regulate the T3SS effector gene nopP in an indirect way. Meanwhile, nolA, nodW, and some T3SS-related genes besides nopP were also demonstrated as new “repressors” that seriously impaired CCBAU53363 symbiosis with mung bean. Taken together, the roles and essentiality of nolA and nodD1 in modulating symbiotic compatibility are sophisticated and host dependent.
IMPORTANCE The main findings of this study were that we clarified that the roles and essentiality of nodD1 and nolA are host dependent. Importantly, for the first time, NolA was found to positively regulate T3SS effector gene nopP to mediate incompatibility on mung bean. Additionally, NolA does not regulate nod genes, which are activated by NodD1. nolA exerts a cumulative effect with nodD1 on CCBAU53363 symbiosis with peanut. These findings shed new light on our understanding of coordinated regulation of NodD1 and NolA in peanut bradyrhizobia with different hosts.}

Research conducted here identified a unique thermophilic bacterium Parageobacillus thermoglucosidasius W-36 with the notable ability of waste residue oil desulfurization, utilization and tolerance of multiplex hazardous organosulfur pollutants. Genome information mining revealed multiple desulfurization systems in three organosulfur-utilizing gene clusters. Enzymatic characterization, phylogenetic relationships, transcriptional performance and structural prediction indicated four novel key monooxygenases for diverse organosulfur removal. Importantly, all monooxygenases shared obvious commonalities in the predicted tertiary structure backbone and catalytic characteristics of C-S bond cleavage, implying the potential of genetic engineering for broad-spectrum hazardous organosulfur removal.

The degradation of highly chlorinated PCBs by aerobic microorganisms is challenging due to their hydrophobicity and persistence. Herein, the biodegradation and adaptation mechanisms of Methylorubrum sp. ZY-1 to PCB 118 were comprehensively investigated using an integrative approach that combined degradation performance, product identification, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses. The results indicated that the highest degradation efficiency of 0.5 mg L−1 PCB 118 reached 75.66% after seven days of inoculation when the bacteria dosage was 1.0 g L−1 at pH 7.0. A total of eleven products were identified during the degradation process, including low chlorinated PCBs, hydroxylated PCBs, and ring-opening products, suggesting that strain ZY-1 degraded PCB 118 through dechlorination, hydroxylation, and ring-opening pathways. Metabolomic analysis demonstrated that the energy supply and redox metabolism of strain ZY-1 was disturbed with exposure to PCB 118. To counteract this environmental stress, strain ZY-1 adjusted both the fatty acid synthesis and purine metabolism. The analysis of transcriptomics disclosed that multiple intracellular and extracellular oxidoreductases (e.g., monooxygenase, alpha/beta hydrolase and cytochrome P450) participated in the degradation of PCB 118. Besides, active efflux of PCB 118 and its degradation intermediates mediated by multiple transporters (e.g., MFS transporter and ABC transporter ATP-binding protein) might enhance bacterial resistance against these substances. These discoveries provided the inaugural insights into the biotransformation of strain ZY-1 to PCB 118 stress, illustrating its potential in the remediation of contaminated environments.}

In order to study the design and effectiveness of graph-based insider threat detection, in this paper, we conduct a systematic and comprehensive survey of existing related research. Specifically, we provide a framework and a taxonomy based on the detection process, classifying existing work from three aspects: data collection, graph construction, and graph anomaly detection. We conduct a quantitative analysis of existing representative graph methods and find that the models with more information have better performance. In particular, we discuss the scalability of existing methods to large-scale networks and their feasibility in real environments. Based on the survey results, we propose 7 pain points in this field and provide specific future research directions. Our survey will provide future researchers with a complete solution.}

Ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase (ENTPDase) represents a family of enzymes that hydrolyze nucleotides and are involved in nucleotide-dependent biological processes. L. infantum has two ENTPDases, namely LiNTPDase1 and LiNTPDase2. Here, we used genetic tools to overexpress or abolish the expression of LiNTPDase1 and -2 to assess their role in parasite growth in culture and macrophage infection. While LiNTPDase1 or 2-overexpressing clones showed no morphological or growth changes in promastigotes, LiNTPDase2 overexpression increased macrophage adhesion and infection by 50% and 30%, respectively. The individual LiNTPDase1 and 2 knockout mutants showed lag in growth profile, which was reversed by the addition of adenine and guanine to the culture media. Moreover, the morphology of the knockout mutants even in supplemented media was changed to an amastigote-like form. The double knockout of both genes was lethal and a mechanism of compensation of deletion of one isoform was detected in these mutants. Correspondingly, the absence of LiNTPDase1 or LiNTPDase2 led to a dramatic reduction in in vitro infection (∼90%). Interestingly, nitric oxide production was decreased in both knockout mutants during infection, which suggests that both LiNTPDases can inhibit macrophage responses against the parasite. Overall, our results show important roles of LiNTPDase1 and -2 concerning in vitro macrophage infection and reinforce their use as potential targets to control Leishmania infections.}

To deeply characterize the molecular adaptations and metabolic processes of this strain when grown in a petroleum-containing environment, transcriptome analysis was performed. A total of 4664 genes and the expression of 3969 genes were observed in strain 15-4. When the strain was grown in petroleum-containing medium, 2192 genes were significantly regulated, of which 1312 (60%) were upregulated and 880 (40%) were downregulated. This strain degraded and adapted to petroleum via modulation of diverse molecular processes, including improvements in transporter activity, oxidoreductase/dehydrogenase activity, two-component system/signal transduction, transcriptional regulation, fatty acid catabolism, amino acid metabolism, and environmental stress responses. Many strain-specific genes were involved in the oxidation of hydrocarbon compounds, such as several luciferase family alkane monooxygenase genes, flavin-utilizing monooxygenase family genes, and flavoprotein-like family alkanesulfonate monooxygenase genes. Several cold shock protein genes were also induced suggesting adaptation to cold environments and the potential for petroleum degradation at low temperatures. The results obtained in this study may broaden our understanding of molecular adaptation of bacteria to hydrocarbon-containing environments and may provide valuable data for further study of L. fusiformis.}

The Web of Things (WoT) paradigm has brought the IoT a step closer to the people perception, because it allows treating a networked thing as a Web resource. Nevertheless, sharing a common application layer protocol on top of the physical “things” does not guarantee that IoT application will be fast-developed, robust and easily evolvable. REST APIs definition for the IoT objects is left to the individual developer. Technological needs may vary along the application lifecycle. Stakeholders are often interested in virtual or aggregated environment features, rather than the single networked thing. To overcome these open issues, we think that it is needed an additional abstraction level between the WoT and the application layer. This should be model-driven – in order this to be adequately agreed by all the IoT stakeholders – and topic-based – because of the event-driven nature of the IoT. In this work we propose Web of Topics (WoX), a Cloud platform for the Internet of (every)Thing (IoE). WoX APIs allows companies and organisations to realise robust and high-maintainable IoT-based services, while minimising deployment costs and the time-to-market. Its model-driven approach guarantees a great end-user experience and a seamless integration among the heterogeneous IoT entities. In this book chapter we present the WoX model and the concrete architecture supporting it. As a proof of concept, in this work we also show how we implemented an original IoT scenarios using the WoX concepts, APIs and architecture: the airport short-stay parking service.}

abstract = {Complexity of cloud infrastructures needs models and tools for process management, configuration, scaling, elastic computing and cloud resource health control. This paper presents a Smart Cloud Engine and solution based on a Knowledge Base, KB, with the aim of modeling cloud resources, Service Level Agreements and their evolutions, and enabling the reasoning on structures by implementing strategies of efficient smart cloud management and intelligence. The solution proposed provides formal verification and intelligence tools for cloud control. It can be easily integrated with a large range of cloud configuration manager, cloud orchestrator, and monitoring tools, since the connections with these tools are performed by using REST calls and XML files. The proposed solution has been validated in the context of large ICARO Cloud project and in the cloud facility of a national cloud service provider. Some data resulting from the validation phases have been reported and are referring to the dynamic management of real ECLAP social network http://www.eclap.eu.}

abstract = {Sustainable treatment of petroleum oil sludge still remains as a major challenge to petroleum refineries. Bioremediation is the promising technology involving bacteria for simultaneous production of biosurfactant and followed by degradation of petroleum compounds. Complete genomic knowledge on such potential microbes could accentuate its successful exploitation. The present study discusses the genomic characteristics of novel biosurfactant producing petrophilic/ petroleum hydrocarbon degrading strain, Enterobacter xiangfangensis STP-3, isolated from petroleum refinery oil sludge contaminated soil. The genome has 4,584,462 bp and 4372 protein coding sequences. Functional analysis using the RAST and KEGG databases revealed the presence of biosynthetic gene clusters linked to glycolipid and lipopeptide production and multiple key candidate genes linked with the degradation pathway of petroleum hydrocarbons. Orthology study revealed diversity in gene clusters associated to membrane transport, carbohydrate, amino acid metabolism, virulence and defence mechanisms, and nucleoside and nucleotide synthesis. The comparative analysis with 27 other genomes predicted that the core genome contributes to its inherent bioremediation potential, whereas the accessory genome influences its environmental adaptability in unconventional environmental conditions. Further, experimental results showed that E. xiangfangensis STP-3 was able to degrade PHCs by 82 % in 14 days during the bioremediation of real time petroleum oil sludge with the concomitant production of biosurfactant and metabolic enzymes, To the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive genomic study has been previously reported on the biotechnological prospective of this species.}
